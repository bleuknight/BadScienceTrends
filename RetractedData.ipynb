      "{17590272: 'Various surgical procedures, e.g. thoracotomy and inguinal hernia repair, frequently evoke persistent pain lasting for many months following the initial surgery. The essential prolonged tissue retraction required during such surgeries may account for the persistence and high incidence of postoperative pain in these patient populations. This study describes a new rat model of persistent postoperative pain evoked by skin/muscle incision and retraction (SMIR), akin to a clinical procedure. Under anaesthesia, skin and superficial muscle of the medial thigh were incised and a small pair of retractors inserted. This tissue was retracted for 1h causing potential stretch of the saphenous nerve. SMIR surgery evoked persistent significant mechanical hypersensitivity to von Frey stimulation of the plantar ipsilateral hindpaw, compared to either pre-surgery responses or concurrent responses of sham-operated rats. SMIR-evoked mechanical hypersensitivity was observed by postoperative day 3, most prominent between postoperative days 10 and 13, persisted until at least postoperative day 22 and had dissipated by postoperative day 32. Overall, mechanical sensitivity of the SMIR contralateral paw and the sham ipsilateral paw did not significantly change from pre-surgery responses. SMIR did not evoke significant heat hyperalgesia or cold allodynia. Light microscopy of saphenous nerve sections did not show degeneration or oedema in the saphenous nerve at, or proximally or distally to, the surgical site. In addition, very little to no degeneration was detected with ATF3 staining in DRG from SMIR-operated rats. These data suggest that prolonged retraction of superficial tissue evokes a persistent pain syndrome that is not driven by neuronal damage.', 23169028: u'Transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) is a 30 year old procedure for diagnosing and staging of lung cancer. There has been renewed interest in TBNA due to the development of a curvilinear array endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) scope for TBNA. Reports indicate an increased diagnostic yield compared to standard TBNA. In 9 of 11 patients EBUS-TBNA is performed with the second generation Olympus EBUS scope (BF-UC180F) and the ViziShot (NA-201SX-4022) needle in addition to the standard WANG\\u2122 TBNA needle. Three punctures were made by the ViziShot needle. The first puncture, the guidewire is partially retracted and without suction the needle is moved back and forth inside the lesion. The second puncture, the guidewire is completely removed and suction is applied during needle movement. The third puncture is without the guidewire but with suction. In five patients with a positive diagnosis of cancer, the first punctures were all positive with a better quality and quantity of tumor cells. Three patients, standard TBNA needle was used, all were positive. Four patients with standard TBNA preceded the EBUS-TBNA were all positive. We conclude, EBUS TBNA is highly effective and dependable and suggest the use of EBUS needle can be simplified. Standard TBNA needle can be used for EBUS-TBNA and standard TBNA in relation to EBUS-TBNA needs to be further investigated.', 1495051: \"Data from clinical sting challenge investigations indicate that certain species of yellowjackets experience sting apparatus autotomy with surprisingly high frequency. However, a retrospective survey of vespid collectors strongly supports the supposition that the frequency of yellowjacket sting autotomy seen in clinical situations is not representative of the frequency experienced under field conditions. Examination by electron microscopy of the sting apparatuses of several vespid species and that of Apis mellifera L., the honey bee, revealed previously unreported structural variations between apid and vespid aculei which likely contribute to differences in sting autotomy rates observed between the honey bee and the social wasps. Specifically, when the lancets of a vespid aculeus are in a retracted position, the width of the smooth-edged stylet extends beyond the barbed edges of the lancets, forming a protective sheath. By contrast, all honey bee aculei possess stylets of insufficient width to shroud the barbs of retracted lancets, thus allowing the barbs to be completely exposed. Additionally, the dorsal surface of all vespid stylets are smooth in contrast to the dorsal surface of honey bee stylets, which support from one to three rows of paired barbs. The exposure of barbs on retracted honey bee lancets and the presence of additional barbs on the dorsal tip of the stylet would make withdrawal of a honey bee aculeus from a victim's flesh more difficult than withdrawal of a vespid aculeus, in which the barbs of retracted lancets are shielded and no dorsal barbs are present.\", 15585294: 'In this report, a method is presented for gaining direct access to cortical areas within the lateral fissure of primates for neuroanatomical tracer injections and electrode array implantation. Compared to areas on the surface of the brain, the anatomical and physiological properties of areas within the fissure are poorly understood. Typically, access to these areas is indirectly achieved by ablating or passing through intervening areas. To enable direct experimental access, a neurosurgical technique was developed in primates whereby the banks of the lateral fissure were retracted with sparing of the vascular network and intervening areas. In some animals, anatomical tracers were directly injected into target fields without contamination of other areas. In others, multichannel electrode arrays were implanted into target areas for chronic recording of neural activity. Since, these techniques could be adapted for exploration of areas within other sulci, the approach represents an important advance in efforts to elucidate the functional organization of the primate cerebral cortex.', 27471887: \"OBJECTIVE Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is prevalent in the aged population and is commonly treated with bur hole drainage. This treatment, however, can lead to various surgical complications. Atorvastatin may cure CSDH via its antiinflammatory and proangiogenesis effects, but not all patients treated with this medication can avoid surgery. The authors' aim was to investigate the effect of atorvastatin and identify characteristics of patients with CSDH sensitive to atorvastatin therapy. METHODS A prospective, placebo-controlled observational study was conducted in 80 patients with evidence of CSDH. The patients were enrolled between February 2012 and August 2014 and were randomly assigned to either atorvastatin treatment (atorvastatin group) or placebo (control group). Patients were followed up for 12 months after initiation of treatment. Clinically relevant data were collected and compared between the 2 groups. The atorvastatin group was subdivided into patients who required surgery and those who did not, and characteristics of these subgroups were also compared. The relationship between atorvastatin treatment and need for surgery was investigated by means of multiple regression analysis using the following variables as predictors: age, sex, admission Markwalder grade, level of dependency in activities of daily living (ADL) as assessed with the modified Barthel Index, presence of hemiparesis, and hematoma volume. RESULTS The proportion of patients who required surgical intervention during the follow-up period was significantly lower in the atorvastatin group than in the control group (p = 0.001), and the mean time to surgery was longer in the atorvastatin group (p = 0.018). Within the atorvastatin group, there was a significant difference with respect to Markwalder grades, degree of dependency in ADL, percentage of patients with hemiparesis, and mean hematoma volume between the patients who required surgery during the follow-up period and those who did not (p = 0.002, p = 0.001, p = 0.001, and p = 0.012, respectively). The results of the logistic regression analysis showed that atorvastatin significantly reduced the probability of surgery and that female sex and favorable admission Markwalder grades and favorable dependency status with respect to ADL (independent, slightly dependent, or moderately dependent) were independent predictors of not requiring surgery. CONCLUSIONS Atorvastatin administration can promote the resolution of CSDH, especially for women with favorable Markwalder grades and favorable ADL dependency status at admission.\", 8816656: 'We used magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate thirty shoulders in twenty-nine patients who had unacceptable pain and loss of function after at least one operative procedure for a lesion of the rotator cuff. A preoperative history was recorded and physical and radiographic examinations were performed before magnetic resonance imaging. All patients had a reoperation two to 156 months (average, thirty-two months) after the operation. The results of the magnetic resonance imaging and the findings at the most recent operation were then compared with regard to the integrity of the rotator cuff, the deltoid muscle, and the long head of the biceps tendon. The sensitivity and specificity of magnetic resonance imaging for the diagnosis of full-thickness tears, partial-thickness tears, and intact rotator cuffs were 84 and 91 per cent, 83 and 83 per cent, and 80 and 100 per cent, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values were 94 and 77 per cent, 56 and 95 per cent, and 100 and 96 per cent, respectively. Three shoulders had a clinically detached and retracted origin of the deltoid muscle that was identified correctly on magnetic resonance imaging, and this finding was confirmed operatively. A rupture of the long head of the biceps tendon was identified correctly in four of six shoulders. In one of the two remaining shoulders, the rupture was obscured on magnetic resonance imaging because of a so-called balloon artefact from a nearby metal suture anchor. Magnetic resonance imaging detected two unexpected lesions: a denudation of the articular cartilage in one shoulder and a ganglion cyst in the supraspinatus muscle in another.', 2455574: 'The immunohistochemical distribution of Forssman glycosphingolipid (GSL) in mouse hematopoietic tissue was examined by using light and electron microscopic immunoperoxidase methods with a highly specific rabbit anti-Forssman GSL antibody. Bone marrow, splenic red pulp, and thymic macrophages, which are closely associated with hematopoietic cells, were stained by the antibody, whereas hematopoietic cells, circulating cells, alveolar macrophages, Kupffer cells, peritoneal resident macrophages, and macrophages derived from granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units cultured in the presence of L-cell-conditioned medium were not stained. In addition, thymic cortical epithelial cells, the framework of reticular cells of the cortical and medullary regions of the mesenteric lymph node and periarterial lymphoid sheath of the spleen, and some vessels of the tissues examined were also stained. After phlebotomy, the fine cytoplasmic processes of Forssman-positive splenic red pulp macrophages were distributed extensively throughout the erythroid colonies. On the other hand, after hypertransfusion, these macrophages retracted their processes, became round, and tended to aggregate. These results indicate that Forssman GSL can be used as an immunohistochemical marker for stromal macrophages in the hematopoietic foci of the bone marrow and splenic red pulp.', 15296857: 'Recent advances in genetical engineering of the mouse have highlighted the importance of reproducible and less invasive models of cerebral ischemia in mice. In this paper, we developed minimally invasive and reproducible model of distal middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion in mice using krypton (Kr) laser-induced photothrombosis. C57BL/6 or BALB mice (n=8 each) were anesthetized with halothane. The skin was cut, the temporal muscle was retracted, and the right distal MCA was observed through the skull. A Kr laser beam of wavelength 568 nm was focused onto the MCA over the intact skull. Upon laser irradiation, intravenous administration of a rose bengal solution was begun. After 4 min of irradiation, the laser beam was refocused on the MCA just proximal to the first spot, and another 4-min irradiation was performed. Then, the right common carotid artery (CCA) was ligated. Three days later, the brain was removed, and infarct volume was determined. Infarction confined almost solely to the cortical area was produced in each mouse. Mean infarct volume in C57BL/6 mice was 25.2+/-13.7 mm3. The BALB mice group showed significantly larger and more reproducible infarction (44.1+/-5.2 mm3; the coefficient of variation was 12%) than did C57BL/6 mice (P<0.005).

This offers opportunities to study atherosclerosis development and plaque vulnerability noninvasively. In this review, we discuss MRI contrast agents targeted toward atherosclerotic plaques and illustrate how these new imaging platforms could assist in our understanding of atherogenesis and atheroprogression. In particular, we highlight the challenges and limitations of the different contrast agents and hurdles for clinical application. We describe the most promising existing compounds to detect atherosclerosis and plaque vulnerability. Of particular interest are the fibrin-targeted compounds that detect thrombi and, furthermore, the contrast agents targeted to integrins that allow to visualize plaque neovascularization. Moreover, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1-targeted iron oxides seem promising for early detection of atherosclerosis. These targeted MRI contrast agents, however promising and well characterized in (pre)clinical models, lack specificity for plaque vulnerability.', 25227305: StringElement(\"Traditionally, total thyroidectomy was performed through an open transcervical incision; in cases where there was evident nodal metastasis, the conventional surgical approach was to extend the incision into a large single transverse incision to complete the required neck dissection. However, recent innovation in the surgical technique of thyroidectomy has offered the opportunity to reduce the patient's burden from these prominent surgical scars in the neck. Minimally invasive surgical techniques have been developed and applied by many institutions worldwide, and more recently, various techniques of remote access surgery have been suggested and actively applied.1-6 Since the advent of robotic surgical systems, some have adopted the concept of remote access surgery into developing various robotic thyroidectomy techniques. The more former and widely acknowledged robotic thyroidectomy technique uses a transaxillary (TA) approach, which has been developed by Chung et al. in Korea.7,8 This particular technique has some limitations in the sense that accessing the lymph nodes of the central compartment is troublesome. Terris et al. realized some shortcomings of robotic TA thyroidectomy, especially in their patients in the United States, and developed and reported the feasibility of robotic facelift thyroidectomy.9-13 In cases of thyroid carcinomas with lateral neck node metastases, most abandoned the concept of minimally invasive or remote access surgery and safely adopted conventional open surgical methods to remove the tumor burden. However, Chung et al. have attempted to perform concomitant modified radical neck dissection (MRND) after robotic thyroidectomy through the same TA port.14 This type of robot-assisted neck dissection (RAND) had some inherent limitations, due to fact that lymph nodes of the upper neck were difficult to remove. Over the past few years, we have developed a RAND via modified facelift (MFL) or retroauricular (RA) approach and reported the feasibility and safety of this technique.15, 16 Since then, we have actively applied such RAND techniques in various head and neck cancers. In our country, almost all cases of robotic total thyroidectomy utilize the TA approach. According to the reports made by Terris et al., robotic facelift thyroidectomy technique has been solely applied for ipsilateral hemithyroidectomy. For total thyroidectomy, Terris et al. performed the robotic surgery with bilateral RA incisions. Here, we intend to introduce our novel surgical method after successfully attempting simultaneous robotic total thyroidectomy and RAND via a single RA approach without an axillary incision.

Belief in the importance of these factors has inspired major policy initiatives, but evidence to support them is either non-existent or derived from self-reports and other sources that have known limitations. We used a retrospective study design to verify whether risk factors for scientific misconduct could predict the occurrence of retractions, which are usually the consequence of research misconduct, or corrections, which are honest rectifications of minor mistakes. Bibliographic and personal information were collected on all co-authors of papers that have been retracted or corrected in 2010-2011 (N=611 and N=2226 papers, respectively) and authors of control papers matched by journal and issue (N=1181 and N=4285 papers, respectively), and were analysed with conditional logistic regression. Results, which avoided several limitations of past studies and are robust to different sampling strategies, support the notion that scientific misconduct is more likely in countries that lack research integrity policies, in countries where individual publication performance is rewarded with cash, in cultures and situations were mutual criticism is hampered, and in the earliest phases of a researcher's career. The hypothesis that males might be prone to scientific misconduct was not supported, and the widespread belief that pressures to publish are a major driver of misconduct was largely contradicted: high-impact and productive researchers, and those working in countries in which pressures to publish are believed to be higher, are less-likely to produce retracted papers, and more likely to correct them. Efforts to reduce and prevent misconduct, therefore, might be most effective if focused on promoting research integrity policies, improving mentoring and training, and encouraging transparent communication amongst researchers.\", 25243705: 'RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) provides information not only about the level of expression of individual genes but also about genomic sequences of host cells. When we use transcriptome data with whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variant information, the allele frequency can show the genetic composition of the cell population and/or chromosomal aberrations. Here, I show how SNPs in mRNAs can be used to evaluate RNA-seq experiments by focusing on RNA-seq data based on a recently retracted paper on stimulus-triggered acquisition of pluripotency (STAP) cells.

Retracted clots were resistant to fibrinolysis in a milieu without dissolved plasminogen, because the amount of fibrin-bound plasminogen in retracted clots was insufficient for successful clot lysis. In plasma containing plasminogen, retracted clots were successfully lysed with fibrin-specific plasminogen activators, but not with non-fibrin-specific activators. Preincubation of retracted clots in plasma increased their plasminogen content as well as their sensitivity to fibrinolysis. The rate of lysis was increased up to 100-times when plasminogen activator and plasminogen were introduced into cylindrical clots by pressure-induced bulk flow in comparison with diffusion alone. The magnitude of the increase was similar in retracted and nonretracted clots, but the absolute rate of lysis was faster in non-retracted clots. The influence of fibrin fiber thickness on fibrinolysis was studied by atomic force microscopy. The time to complete lateral section of fibers did not differ between thick and thin composite fibers, and the rate of diameter reduction was faster in thick fibers than in thin ones. Taken together our results suggest that lysis of retracted clots proceeds in circular stages: (a) activation of bound plasminogen followed by partial degradation of fibrin, (b) opening of new plasminogen-binding sites on partly degraded fibrin, (c) binding of plasminogen to the new binding sites which enhances the susceptibility of clots to lysis. Lysis is accelerated by bulk flow of plasminogen activator and plasminogen into clots in comparison to diffusion alone.

After confirmed the AD cellular model, the cells were co-culture with hDPSCs by transwell co-culture system till 24\\u2009h for treatment. Then the cytomorphology of the hDPSCs-treated cells were found to restore gradually with re-elongation of retracted dendrites. Meanwhile, Cell Counting Kit-8 assay and Hoechst 33258 staining showed that hDPSCs caused significant increase in the viability and decrease in apoptosis of the model cells, respectively. Observation of DiI labeling also exhibited the prolongation dendrites in hDPSCs-treated cells which were obviously different from the retraction dendrites in AD model cells. Furthermore, specific staining of \\u03b1-tubulin and F-actin demonstrated that the hDPSCs-treated cells had the morphology of restored neurons, with elongated dendrites, densely arranged microfilaments, and thickened microtubular fibrils. In addition, results from western blotting revealed that phosphorylation at Ser 396 of Tau protein was significantly suppressed by adding of hDPSCs. These results indicate that hDPSCs may promote regeneration of damaged neuron cells in vitro model of AD and may serve as a useful cell source for treatment of AD.\", 10328761: 'Antithrombotic and clotting factors have long been targets for drug discovery, necessitating the development of blood assays to determine the efficacy of lead compounds prior to animal testing. We have developed a reconstituted blood clot lysis assay which eliminates the need for on-site donors. The assay uses whole blood stored at 4 degrees C obtained from a local blood bank, diluted 1:10 in phosphate buffer. This blood was supplemented with 125I-labeled fibrinogen and the release of radioactive fibrinopeptides from formed clots was measured. The whole blood used in this assay, which had been stored at 4 degrees C for several days, no longer formed solid or retracting clots. Thus, platelets 5-7 days ex vivo (165 x 10(6) platelets) were added to the whole blood in the presence of thrombin (0.80 IU/ml) to form clots. Solid clots formed within 2 min of thrombin addition and began retracting shortly thereafter. In the absence of any thrombolytic agent, clots fully retracted within 2.5 h and remained stable. Thrombin-stimulated clot formation was completely inhibited by heparin. Clots could be lysed in a dose-dependent fashion in the presence of tissue-type plasminogen activator. Clot lysis could be completely inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion with plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1. To demonstrate the utility of this assay as a screen for thrombolytic agents, a 14-amino-acid PAI-1-inhibitory peptide relieved the PAI-1 effect on tPA in a dose-dependent fashion. These data describe an assay for the screening of potential pro-fibrinolytic agents that target PAI-1 inhibition in a human plasma-based system that is versatile, cost-effective, and physiologically relevant and does not rely on the availability of on-site blood donors.', 3400036: 'The difficulty in passing segments of the intestine from the abdominal cavity to the desired location during pull-through procedures has been facilitated considerably by the use of a new device called the enterotractor.

No complications have been encountered using this tool in the 63 patients intervened since 1982 and the operating time has been shortened creating an adequate size tunnel for the pull-through procedure. Excellent traction of the intestinal segment is provided, and the use of pursestring sutures and clamps is avoided.

Phonologically, transparent vowels are front, but they can be followed by either front or back suffixes. However, a finer look reveals an underlying phonetic coherence in two respects. First, transparent vowels in back harmony contexts show a less advanced (more retracted) tongue body posture than phonemically identical vowels in front harmony contexts: e.g. [i] in buli-val is less advanced than [i] in bili-vel. Second, transparent vowels in monosyllabic stems selecting back suffixes are also less advanced than phonemically identical vowels in stems selecting front suffixes: e.g. [i] in \\xedr, taking back suffixes, compared to [i] of h\\xedr, taking front suffixes, is less advanced when these stems are produced in bare form (no suffixes). We thus argue that the phonetic degree of tongue body horizontal position correlates with the phonological alternation in suffixes. A hypothesis that emerges from this work is that a plausible phonetic basis for transparency can be found in quantal characteristics of the relation between articulation and acoustics of transparent vowels. More broadly, the proposal is that the phonology of transparent vowels is better understood when their phonological patterning is studied together with their articulatory and acoustic characteristics.\", 28958817: 'Progress in science is dependent on a strong foundation of reliable results.

Inclusion criteria were: female patients with congenital or acquired inverted nipples, a minimum sample size of 10 nipples, and studies reporting recurrence of inversion with a minimum follow-up of six months. Exclusion criteria were nipple inversion caused by malignancy. Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria which all had a level of evidence IV. No non-invasive treatment techniques were identified.

The purpose of this investigation is to study its anatomic rationale and clinical outcomes, in addition to the role of dorsal digital veins in digital reconstruction. Patients (n = 765) suffering from digital terminal segment traumatic wounds (823 digits) were identified and reviewed in a retrospective manner. The wounds were repaired using distally based dorsal digital fasciocutaneous flaps with venoneuroadipofascial pedicles. Skin flaps survived in 818 digits (99.4%), whereas 5 flaps (0.6%) became partially necrotic. Postoperative follow-up data were available from 521 patients involving 559 digits, for an average duration of 10 months (range, 4-36 months). The wider pedicled fascial flap (1.0-1.5 cm) was significantly associated with a decreased occurrence of blebs, whereas the first few patients with pedicled fascial flaps 0.5 to 1.0 cm wide exhibited more frequent occurrence of blebs and flap contractures. The flaps retracted in size within the first 2 to 3 months at the rate of 10% compared with the intraoperative outlined size. The skin flaps became mildly pigmented within the first postoperative month, and at 6 months the flaps turned brighter in color, almost approximating the color of the normal digits. At 12 months, both the texture and appearance of the flaps were acceptable. The donor sites healed without any scar contracture. The digital terminals appeared grossly normal with acceptable digital function. Without any neural reconstruction, skin flap sensation was rated as S2 to S3+, whereas with neural reconstruction the 2-point discrimination sensitivity measured 4 to 9 mm.

The present study examined the effects of chemical destruction of dopaminergic neurons in the brain on DA production and ovarian development in the sapphire devil Chrysiptera cyanea, a reef-associated damselfish. The avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method using an antibody against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a critical enzyme in the DA synthesis pathway, identified a population of dopaminergic neurons with somata in the anteroventral preoptic nucleus of the diencephalon and fibers terminating in the proximal pars distalis of the pituitary. Maintaining fish in seawater containing 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) at 0.02 and 0.2 \\xb5g/mL for 2 days resulted in decreases in DA, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC; DA metabolite), and DA metabolic rate in the whole brain. The number of TH-positive neurons in the diencephalon decreased after 0.02 \\xb5g/mL MPTP treatment for 2 days. These results suggest that MPTP treatment destroys TH-positive neurons in the diencephalon, thereby decreasing the synthesis and release of DA from the brain. This treatment rescued ovarian development in fish with artificially retracted ovaries during the spawning season. The gonadosomatic index of MPTP-treated fish 5 and 7 days after treatment was significantly higher than that of control fish. Oocytes in the vitellogenic stages were observed in the ovaries of MPTP-treated fish, but not in control fish. These results suggest that DA in the brain drives ovarian development in the sapphire devil.', 17543299: 'Chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve is an animal model for neuropathic pain. In this model, the analgesic potency of systemic morphine was significantly diminished in nerve-injured mice (ED(50) 19.4 mg/kg) compared with sham-operated mice (ED(50) 3.3 mg/kg) using a unilateral hot plate withdrawal test, with a similar reduction in sensitivity of intrathecal morphine. The sciatic nerve injury resulted in a reorganization of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Immunohistochemically, the chronic constriction injury triggered a withdrawal of C-fibers from the ipsilateral dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Although A-beta terminals centrally sprouted into Lamina II of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, the peripheral A-beta fibers in the skin retracted from the epidermis to deeper layers of the dermis. To explore the functional significance of these dermal changes, we examined the topical morphine and lidocaine analgesia following chronic sciatic nerve constriction. Both morphine and lidocaine retained topical activity following chronic sciatic nerve injury, but their analgesic dose-response curves were shifted to the right when compared to sham-operated mice. Thus, the chronic nerve constriction injury model is associated with pathological changes in distribution of the central and peripheral axons of the dorsal root ganglion neurons that correspond to a decreased pharmacological sensitivity to topical analgesic agents.', 9345157: 'A prospective survey was conducted to test the hypothesis that maximum anchorage can be achieved in the maxillary arch by controlling forces and moments using intraarch mechanics while retracting canines into first premolar extraction sites. The sample consisted of 24 patients (mean age 18 years, 9 months) who required the extraction of two maxillary first premolars, with or without extractions in the mandibular arch. Movements of the first molars, canines, and incisors were evaluated with 6 cephalometric variables and 10 study model variables. T tests were used to assess differences between pretreatment and postretraction tooth positions. Cephalometrically, the maxillary first molars (left and right sides combined) moved mesially ONLY 0.7 mm (SD 0.43; p < 0.008).

Depending on the cell line, blebs play important roles in many different phenomena including mitosis and locomotion. The expansion phase of cellular blebbing has been mathematically modelled in detail. However, the active processes occurring during the retraction phase are not so well characterized. It is thought that blebs retract because a cortex reforms inside, and adheres to, the bleb membrane. This cortex is retracted into the cell and the attached bleb membrane follows. Using a computational model of a cell's membrane, cortex and interconnecting adhesions, we demonstrate that cortex retraction alone cannot account for bleb retraction and suggest that the mechanism works in tandem with membrane shrinking. Further, an emergent hysteresis loop is observed in the intracellular pressure, which suggests a potential mechanism through which a secondary bleb can be initiated as a primary bleb contracts.\", 29403283: StringElement('Article retraction is a measure taken by journals or authors where there is evidence of research misconduct or error, redundancy, plagiarism or unethical research.

The goals of this study were to investigate the source(s) of this observed difference and to assess whether the 3D axial slice width could be significantly improved by acquisition and simultaneous reconstruction of axially interleaved data. The axial slice width was measured for the three acquisition modes of the Advance scanner ('standard' high-sensitivity 2D, high-resolution 2D and 3D), with the septa both extended and retracted. A significant degradation in the axial slice width for 3D compared with that for high-sensitivity 2D mode was seen. Near the centre, this difference can largely be attributed to septa collimation effects of the 2D data. At larger radial positions, axial mispositioning of cross-coincidences in 2D acquisitions overshadows the effects of septa collimation, while 3D reconstruction effects also become more important. The axial slice width was estimated to improve by 0.3-1.1 mm with interleaving. This modest improvement would be accompanied by an increase in image noise, since an axial filter with a higher cut-off would be required in the 3D reconstruction to achieve this resolution in the image.\", 9212072: 'Previous studies have demonstrated neuron-specific differences in the inhibitory effects of depolarization upon neurite outgrowth. We examined whether there is a relationship between the normal impulse activity level of an axon and the effect of depolarization upon its growth. Inactive phasic motor axons and active tonic motor axons grow from crayfish abdominal nerve cord explants in culture. Depolarization of these axons with high K solutions produced greater inhibition of advancing growth cones from the phasic axons than from the tonic axons. During the period 20-40 min after the beginning of depolarization, tonic axon growth cones continued to advance, whereas phasic axon growth cones retracted. During chronic depolarization, all of the phasic axons retracted during the first day and approximately half of the phasic axons had degenerated after 4 days of depolarization. The majority of tonic axons continue to grow after 3 days of depolarization, and all of the tonic axon growth survived the 4 days of depolarization. The different responses of the growing phasic and tonic axons to depolarization appear to be Ca2+ dependent. The inhibitory effects of depolarization upon phasic axon growth were reduced by the Ca2+ channel blockers La3+ and Mg2+. Application of a Ca2+ ionophore, A23187, produces greater inhibition of phasic axon growth than tonic axon growth. This study demonstrates that depolarization produces greater inhibition of growth from inactive motor axons than from active motor axons. This is likely due to differences in Ca2+ regulation and/or sensitivity to intracellular Ca2+.', 21430443: u'Retraction for: \"The WNT-5a derived peptide, Foxy-5, possesses dual properties that impair progression of ERa negative breast cancer,\" by Caroline E.

The levers were retracted from the test chamber for a short period after each response to control the speed at which the rats could complete the sequence (paced FCN). Changes in the average chain length may reflect the influence of impulsivity on the execution of behavioral patterns. Although they quickly learned to press the levers, SHR rats performed poorly compared to the WKY rats when the chain length requirement was increased to FCN 6 and FCN 8. Eventually stable performance was obtained under paced FCN 6, although the SHR rats continued to have a consistently lower average chain length. Both strains of rats were treated with imipramine (10 mg/kg), chlordiazepoxide (3 and 10 mg/kg), d-amphetamine (0.4 and 0.8 mg/kg), haloperidol (0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg), 8-OH-DPAT (0.1 mg/kg), WAY-100635 (0.1 mg/kg), and DOI (0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg). The SHR rats were less sensitive to the effects of d-amphetamine, chlordiazepoxide, and DOI and slightly more sensitive to the effects of haloperidol. All of these drugs reduced the average chain length. There was no difference in the response of the two strains to imipramine and 8-OH-DPAT, both of which increased the average chain length. These results support the suggestion that SHR rats may more impulsive than WKY rats. The data with d-amphetamine and haloperidol support biochemical findings that these rats have a deficit in dopaminergic function, and the strain differences in response to chlordiazepoxide and DOI suggest that that there may be differences in GABAergic and 5-HT2-mediated neurotransmission relevant to regulating impulse control in the rat.', 29024436: u'Previous studies have shown that peptides derived from milk proteins can improve blood pressure. Therefore, the authors tested the blood pressure-lowering effects of a hydrolyzed whey protein supplement rich in bioactive peptides. In a 6-week controlled study, 30 prehypertensive or stage 1 hypertensive subjects (blood pressure \\u2265120/80 mm Hg and \\u2264155/95 mm Hg) were randomized to receive 20 g/d of either a hydrolyzed whey protein (active treatment) or an unmodified whey protein (control treatment). Blood pressure, blood lipids, safety measures, side effects, and diet were evaluated throughout the trial. After completion of treatment, a 4-week follow-up was conducted. There was a mean reduction of 8.0+3.2 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure (P<.05) and of 5.5\\xb12.1 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure (P<.05) in the treatment group compared with the control group.

We have developed an inferior vena cava (IVC) occluder that can safely and conveniently drain blood from the IVC. This device has been clinically applied in one patient, as described herein. The framework for this device is made from a single superelastic nitinol wire, 0.30 mm in diameter. Diameter of the spreading site of the device is decided from computed tomographic images. A polyester fabric membrane (thickness 0.10 mm) is set at the tip of this framework. The occluder is deployed through an 18-F sheath. This device was used in a 64-year-old woman with lipoma in the right atrial wall near the IVC-right atrium interface. In this patient, it might not have been possible to completely reset the tumour by conventional IVC occlusion using a snare. The occluder was smoothly and safely deployed and retracted. During placement of the occluder, blood did not flow from the IVC into the right atrium. During extracorporeal circulation, vacuum drainage was performed with no air contamination. The tumour was resected by a three-arm da Vinci Surgical System. The IVC occluder needs to completely block the IVC and avoid obstructing the inflow region of the hepatic vein. This device obviates the need to place a snare on the IVC, and thus should directly improve the safety of robotic cardiac surgery and shorten the operating time.', 18174140: 'DsbA ensures the correct folding of many exported bacterial proteins by forming intramolecular disulphide bonds in the bacterial periplasm. The pathogen Neisseria meningitidis is unusual in its possession of three different dsbA genes (dsbA1, dsbA2 and dsbA3), encoding two membrane-anchored (DsbA1 and DsbA2) and one periplasmic (DsbA3) thiol-disulphide oxidoreductase enzymes. In this study, the involvement of DsbA1 and DsbA2 in natural competence was confirmed and attributed to events in the early stages of the transformation process. Strains lacking both DsbA1 and DsbA2 were reduced in competence as a result of decreased DNA binding and uptake. Overexpression of DsbA3 could not overcome this defect, suggesting differences in substrate specificity and protein-folding abilities between the DsbA homologues. Competence in Neisseria is dependent on the expression of type IV pili, which are extruded and retracted through the outer-membrane secretin PilQ. Both DsbA1 and DsbA2 were able to specifically bind PilQ in solid-phase overlay assays. Consistent with this, deletion of both dsbA1 and dsbA2 resulted in reduced levels of PilQ, confirming inefficient folding of PilQ, while pilus expression was apparently unaffected. The secretin PilQ is involved in DNA binding and transport as well as pilus biogenesis, and the defect in PilQ folding resulting from the absence of DsbA1 and DsbA2 is revealed in the observed decreased DNA binding and uptake.', 2551498: 'The relevance of urokinase receptors to urokinase-mediated laminin degradation was investigated in cultured colon cancer. Six colon cancer cell lines degraded laminin in a plasminogen-dependent manner. The ability of the individual cell lines to cleave the glycoprotein correlated well (r2 = 0.9242) with the amount of urokinase recovered from the cell surface by a mild acid treatment. A radioreceptor assay indicated that colon cancer cells most active in degrading the laminin, possessed the largest number of urokinase receptors. Moreover, acid treatment which depletes the receptors of endogenous plasminogen activator augmented the specific binding of radioactive urokinase to the colon cancer cells by 12-200%. A cell line (HCT 116) which displayed 1.1 x 10(5) receptors/cell the majority of which were occupied with endogenous urokinase was selected and the effects of a urokinase receptor antagonist on laminin degradation determined. The peptide antagonist reduced laminin turnover by 60-80%. Morphological observations were consistent with these findings. Plasminogen-treated HCT 116 cells retracted from the culture dish and many cells were observed in the culture medium. This effect could be largely reversed by simultaneous treatment with the peptide antagonist. A poor correlation was found between laminin degradation and soluble urokinase (r2 = 0.1074). These data strongly argue for a role of the urokinase receptor in facilitating the action of the plasminogen activator in colon cancer.', 1947845: 'By transrectal ultrasonography the volume of the prostate is determined two times using the conventional planimetric method.

In this manner the total volume of the prostate is calculated. In a post-mortem study prostates of 9 cadavers were measured with the conventional planimetry and by means of digital processing and analysis. The results were compared with the results obtained after removal of the prostate. In a clinical study the prostatic volumes of 20 patients were measured in a similar way. The results of the two methods are compared. Both in the cadaver study and the patient study we found a good correlation between the conventional method and the computerized method.

Thrombin cleaves and thereby activates its own seven-transmembrane-domain receptor which couples to G proteins. Thrombin also can inhibit neuronal differentiation, supposedly by degrading components of the extracellular matrix. Here we report that active thrombin induces immediate cell rounding and neurite retraction in differentiating N1E-115 and NG108-15 neural cells in serum-free culture. Serum (0.5-5% vol/vol) evokes similar responses, but the cell-rounding and neurite-retracting activity of serum is not attributable to thrombin. Neural cell rounding is transient, subsiding after 10-15 min, and subject to homologous desensitization, whereas retracted neurites rapidly degenerate. Thrombin action is inhibited by cytochalasin, but not colchicine. A novel 14-amino acid peptide agonist of the thrombin receptor fully mimics thrombin's morphoregulatory activity, indicating that thrombin-induced shape changes are receptor-mediated and not secondary to extracellular matrix degradation. Although thrombin receptors couple to phosphoinositide hydrolysis and Ca2+ mobilization, thrombin-induced shape changes appear to depend neither on the Ca2+/protein kinase C- nor the cyclic nucleotide-mediated signal transduction pathways; however, the morphological response to thrombin is blocked by pervanadate, an inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatases, and by broad-specificity kinase inhibitors. Our results suggest that the thrombin receptor communicates to an as-yet-uncharacterized effector to reorganize the actin cytoskeleton and to reverse the differentiated phenotype of neural cells.\", 1370314: 'A mAb was isolated (mAb BD6) that recognized a surface glycoprotein on rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3). The antibody bound to 2 x 10(6) molecules/cell and specifically blocked IgE binding (50% inhibition with 3.48 +/- 0.51 micrograms/ml; mean +/- SEM), although neither IgE nor anti-high affinity IgE receptor (anti-Fc epsilon RI) mAb blocked mAb BD6 binding to the cells. mAb BD6 did not affect the rate of dissociation of cell-bound IgE, nor did it induce or inhibit the internalization of IgE. mAb BD6 did not release histamine. However, it did cause rapid spreading of the cells. By 1 h the cells had retracted to a spherical shape with their surface covered with membranous spikes, and they could easily be detached from the tissue culture plate. These changes differed from those observed after Fc epsilon RI activation. mAb BD6 immunoprecipitated a complex of two proteins, 38 to 50 kDa and 135 kDa from 125I-surface labeled rat basophilic leukemia cells that are not subunits of Fc epsilon RI. Chemical cross-linking studies showed that these molecules are associated on the cell surface. By immunoblotting, mAb BD6 reacted with a 40-kDa protein. Therefore, mAb BD6 binds to a surface protein that is close to the Fc epsilon RI and sterically inhibits 125I-IgE binding.', 15548620: 'We developed a variety of 54-channel high-density silicon electrode arrays (polytrodes) designed to record from large numbers of neurons spanning millimeters of brain. In cat visual cortex, it was possible to make simultaneous recordings from >100 well-isolated neurons. Using standard clustering methods, polytrodes provide a quality of single-unit isolation that surpasses that attainable with tetrodes. Guidelines for successful in vivo recording and precise electrode positioning are described. We also describe a high-bandwidth continuous data-acquisition system designed specifically for polytrodes and an automated impedance meter for testing polytrode site integrity. Despite having smaller interconnect pitches than earlier silicon-based electrodes of this type, these polytrodes have negligible channel crosstalk, comparable reliability, and low site impedances and are capable of making high-fidelity multiunit recordings with minimal tissue damage. The relatively benign nature of planar electrode arrays is evident both histologically and in experiments where the polytrode was repeatedly advanced and retracted hundreds of microns over periods of many hours. It was possible to maintain stable recordings from active neurons adjacent to the polytrode without change in their absolute positions, neurophysiological or receptive field properties.', 350415: 'Pairs of nonneoplastic and spontaneously transformed neoplastic cells were derived from rat, mouse and hamster embryos. The neoplastic cells of each pair had poorly spread cellular morphology, grew in agarose in vitro and produced invasive sarcomas in vivo; the nonneoplastic cells exhibited none of these properties. The distribution of microtubules and microfilament bundles (stress fibers or actin cables) was examined in five such paired lines and in 3T3 and SV40-transformed 3T3 cells by indirect immunofluorescent microscopy of fixed cells treated with rabbit antibody prepared against bovine brain tubulin or guinea pig smooth muscle actin, respectively. Actin cables in all the neoplastic cells appeared thinner and more sparse than in the paired nonneoplastic cells. These differences were also observed in living cells with polarization microscopy. In contrast, microtubules appeared similar in neoplastic and nonneoplastic cells, both in areas of thin peripheral lamellar cytoplasm which allowed a clear visualization of fine, curving microtubules and in regions of thick, central endoplasm which obsecured individual microtubules. In fact, the main morphological difference between neoplastic and nonneoplastic cells was the relative amount of lamellar cytoplasm or endoplasm, rather than the appearance of microtubles in either region. Thus the distinctive growth properties and retracted cellular morphology of neoplastic cells in this study did not correlate with decreased or disorganized microtubules, but with thin and sparse actin cables.', 18553208: StringElement('Currently, pathologies from the presacral space are explored primarily by using transabdominal approaches.

Compared with wild type, scores of cerebral infarct size and neurologic impairment in hIL-37tg mice were obviously lower after 24h ischemia and 72 h reperfusion. Light microscopic and electron microscopic results showed that cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in hIL-37tg mice was less serious than that in WT mice.

Although there are data on plasma clot lysis in newborns, the potential for dissolution of whole blood clots has not been explored. We investigated whether there is a difference between newborns and adults in sensitivity of whole blood clots to lysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA). Blood was obtained from 15 newborns and from 13 adults and anticoagulated with sodium citrate. Whole blood clots were generated by addition of thrombin and calcium. After 3 hours of retraction the clots were put into tubes containing 1.45 mL plasma of the same patient. After 1 hour of incubation, rt-PA was added to result in final concentrations of 3, 1, 0.3, 0.1, and 0 microg/mL. Clots were weighed after 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 hours. At any time point measured, whole blood clot lysis was more efficient in newborns than it was in adults. This was true for spontaneous clot lysis (p <0.05 at 1, 2, and 3 hours) as well as for all concentrations of rt-PA tested (p <0.05 at 1 hour). Whole blood clot lysis in new-borns was most efficient at 1 microg/mL rt-PA, whereas adults showed best lysis at the highest concentration tested (3 microg/mL rt-PA). The rate of plasminogen consumption was similar in newborns and adults. Recommendations for antithrombotic therapy in new-borns have been loosely extrapolated from recommendations for adults. Our data can be helpful in establishing guidelines for thrombolytic therapy in the neonatal period. Retracted whole blood clots mimic better the in vivo situation than previously reported in studies of lysis of nonretracted plasma clots. Based on our data, we think that despite low levels and slower activation kinetics of fetal plasminogen, the dosage of rt-PA should be lower in newborns than in adults.', 16517361: \"Repair of massive rotator cuff tears in the elderly can be challenging because of degenerative, retracted, and contracted tendons producing an extensive defect.

The proliferation of outpatient procedures has heightened interest in MAC sedation agents. Among the most commonly used MAC sedation agents today are benzodiazepines, including midazolam, and propofol. Recently approved in the United States is fospropofol, a prodrug of propofol which hydrolyzes in the body by alkaline phosphatase to liberate propofol. Propofol liberated from fospropofol has unique pharmacological properties, but recently retracted pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) evaluations make it difficult to formulate clear conclusions with respect to fospropofol's PK/PD properties. In safety and efficacy clinical studies, fospropofol demonstrated dose-dependent sedation with good rates of success at doses of 6.5\\u2009mg/kg along with good levels of patient and physician acceptance. Fospropofol has been associated with less pain at injection site than propofol. The most commonly reported side effects with fospropofol are paresthesia and pruritus.

It is well known that in these processes cell movements can be guided by gradients of various chemical signals. In this study, we demonstrate that cell movement can also be guided by purely physical interactions at the cell-substrate interface. We cultured National Institutes of Health 3T3 fibroblasts on flexible polyacrylamide sheets coated with type I collagen. A transition in rigidity was introduced in the central region of the sheet by a discontinuity in the concentration of the bis-acrylamide cross-linker. Cells approaching the transition region from the soft side could easily migrate across the boundary, with a concurrent increase in spreading area and traction forces. In contrast, cells migrating from the stiff side turned around or retracted as they reached the boundary. We call this apparent preference for a stiff substrate \"durotaxis.\" In addition to substrate rigidity, we discovered that cell movement could also be guided by manipulating the flexible substrate to produce mechanical strains in the front or rear of a polarized cell. We conclude that changes in tissue rigidity and strain could play an important controlling role in a number of normal and pathological processes involving cell locomotion.', 16816384: 'CD44, a cell-surface receptor for hyaluronan, has been implicated in endothelial cell functions, but its role in the formation of blood vessels in vivo has not been established. In CD44-null mice, vascularization of Matrigel implants and tumor and wound angiogenesis were inhibited. Leukocyte accumulation during tumor growth and wound healing in wild-type and CD44-null mice were comparable, and reconstitution of CD44-null mice with wild-type bone marrow did not restore the wild-type phenotype, suggesting that impairments in angiogenesis in CD44-deficient mice are due to the loss of endothelial CD44. Although the cell proliferation, survival, and wound-induced migration of CD44-null endothelial cells were intact, these cells were impaired in their in vitro ability to form tubes. Nascent vessels in Matrigel implants from CD44-null mice demonstrated irregular luminal surfaces characterized by retracted cells and thinned endothelia. Further, an anti-CD44 antibody that disrupted in vitro tube formation induced hemorrhage around Matrigel implants, suggesting that antagonism of endothelial CD44 undermined the integrity of the endothelium of nascent vessels. These data establish a role for CD44 during in vivo angiogenesis and suggest that CD44 may contribute to the organization and/or stability of developing endothelial tubular networks.', 16806150: 'To gain an understanding of the genes and mechanisms that govern morphogenesis and its evolution, we have analyzed mutations that disrupt this process in a simple model structure, the male tail tip of the rhabditid nematode C. elegans. During the evolution of rhabditid male tails, there have been several independent changes from tails with rounded tips (\"peloderan\", as in C. elegans) to those with pointed tips (\"leptoderan\"). Mutations which produce leptoderan (Lep) tails in C. elegans thus identify candidate genes and pathways in which evolutionary changes could have produced leptoderan tails from peloderan ancestors. Here we report that two novel, gain-of-function (gf) alleles of lin-41 have lesions predicted to affect the N-terminus of the RBCC-domain LIN-41 protein. Both gf alleles cause the tail tip of adult males to retain the pointed shape of the juvenile tails, producing a Lep phenotype that looks like the tails of leptoderan species. Consistent with its role in the heterochronic pathway, we find that lin-41 governs the timing and extent of male tail tip morphogenesis in a dose-dependent manner. Specifically, the Lep phenotype results from a heterochronic delay in the retraction and fusion of the tail tip cells during L4 morphogenesis, such that retraction is not completed before the adult molt. Conversely, we find that tail tip morphogenesis and cell fusions begin precociously at the L3 stage in the reduced-function lin-41 mutant, ma104, resulting in over-retracted male tails in the adult. Because modulated anti-LIN-41 RNAi knockdowns in the gf mutants restore wild-type phenotype, we suggest that the leptoderan phenotype of the gf alleles is due to a higher activity of otherwise normal LIN-41. Additionally, the gf allele is suppressed by the wild-type allele, suggesting that LIN-41 normally regulates itself, possibly by autoubiquitination. We speculate that small changes affecting LIN-41 could have been significant for male tail evolution.', 16910604: StringElement('Arthroscopic repair of rotator cuff tears is a well described technique with good clinical results.

The present work investigated the occurrence of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis-induced changes of the synaptic covering of spinal motoneurons during exacerbation and after remission. The terminals were typed with transmission electron microscopy as C-, F- and S-type. Immunohistochemical analysis of synaptophysin, glial fibrillary acidic protein and the microglia/macrophage marker F4/80 were also used in order to draw a correlation between the synaptic changes and the glial reaction. The ultrastructural analysis showed that, during exacerbation, there was a strong retraction of both F- and S-type terminals. In this sense, both the covering as well as the length of the remaining terminals suffered great reductions. However, the retracted terminals rapidly returned to apposition, although the mean length remained shorter. A certain level of sprouting may have occurred as, after remission, the number of F-terminals was greater than in the control group. The immunohistochemical analysis showed that the peak of synaptic loss was coincident with an increased macro- and microglial reaction.

In addition, the immunocontent of phosphoserine-containing amino acids was also greatly increased in GFAP recovered in the high-salt Triton insoluble cytoskeletal fraction, corresponding to the polymerized intermedite filament (IF) proteins present in the cell. In conclusion, our results indicate that KIC, KIV, or KMV increased the serine/threonine in vitro phosphorylation of GFAP leading to increased Triton-insoluble GFAP immunocontent and cytoskeletal reorganization. Considering IF networks can be regulated by phosphorylation of polypeptide subunits leading to reorganization of the IF filamentous structure, we could suppose that GFAP hyperphosphorylation and disorganization of cellular structure could be involved in the brain damage characteristic of MSUD patients.', 28272927: StringElement('The effect of an additional neurological injury (suprascapular nerve traction injury) to a chronically retracted rotator cuff muscle is incompletely understood and warrants clarification.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'BACKGROUND', u'Label': u'BACKGROUND'}), 3459364: 'The purpose of this paper was to compare retrospectively the effect on the soft tissues of two contrasting forms of treatment for Class II, Division 1 malocclusion. The first group of 30 persons exhibited uncrowded dentitions and were treated without extractions by means of the Andresen activator. No other appliance was used. The second group was also composed of 30 persons. These subjects were treated with the Begg appliance in its classical form. All of the Begg subjects showed varying amounts of crowding and were treated by extraction of four first premolars. It was believed that the Andresen appliance would maintain the incisors in the most labial position possible, while the Begg group with premolar extractions would involve the maximum lingual incisal movement. These groups were compared with a third group of 22 untreated persons who also exhibited Class II, Division 1 malocclusions. The overjets in the treated groups were successfully reduced in both cases by retraction of the upper incisors; in the Begg group only, retraction of lower incisors was also performed. The upper incisors were retracted substantially more in the Begg group than in the Andresen group, but there was only a slight difference within the two groups in the final position of the upper lip relative to a vertical reference line through sella. There was also a slight difference in the lengths of upper and lower lips within the two treated groups. The lower lip followed the lower incisors more closely in the Begg group. Both upper and lower lips \"uncurled\" in the treated groups and this probably allowed them to be held together with little strain. There was a wide variation in individual response in all three groups.', 16840998: \"The diaphragm is an unusual localization for disseminated erythematous lupus and is generally not recognized. We present the case of a 34-year-old woman who developed bilateral pain in the base of the thorax 15 days before hospitalization without any bronchial signs and NYHA stage II dyspnea. The patient's general health status remained satisfactory and the physical examination was normal except for diffuse inflammatory joint pain and cutaneous photosensitivization. The chest x-ray disclosed ascension of both hemidiaphragms with retracted lungs associated with bilateral basal atalectasia. The diagnosis of lupus with diaphragmatic involvement was retained due to the clinical presentation with diffuse joint pain, photosensitization with facial erythema, pericardial effusion and elevated antinuclear antibody and lymphopenia (1 100/mm3). Lung function tests revealed a restrictive syndrome. Oral corticosteroids 1 mg/kg/d enabled clinical and functional improvement. In light of this observation we discuss the pathogenic mechanisms of this uncommon localization of lupus and the difficulty of establishing a sure diagnosis.\", 20980012: u'A high-pressure liquid chromatography-diode array detection and multi-mode ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-MMI-MS/MS) method was used to identify amino-tadalafil and rimonabant in electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) cartridges. Amino-tadalafil is a drug analogue of the commercially approved Cialis\\u2122 (i.e. tadalafil). Rimonabant is a drug that was, at one time, approved for weight loss in Europe (although approval has been retracted), but not in the United States. In addition, poor quality control over the e-cigarette products analyzed here is shown by the presence of nicotine in products labeled as containing no nicotine or by the presence of significant amounts of rimonabant oxidative degradant in e-cigarette products containing rimonabant.

Vascular compromise has been identified as a possible contributing factor, and was selected for further investigation in the present study. Laser Doppler Flowmetry was used to quantify patella intraosseous blood flow in vivo during TKA surgery without the use of a tourniquet. Flow was measured after medial parapatellar arthrotomy, and compared to flow during patella eversion and lateral retraction. Patella blood flow during eversion was reduced to 13% of baseline values (p<0.05). A significantly greater proportion of flow was preserved during lateral retraction (53%), although the reduction from baseline was still significant (p<0.05). A statistically significant difference in flow (60% of baseline) was also noted when the leg was flexed from full extension to 90 degrees (p<0.05) with the patella in its normal anatomical alignment. In this study, we have demonstrated the sensitivity of the patella blood supply to knee flexion angle and patella dislocation technique, particularly to patella eversion.

Numerous spinules are formed by the terminal dendrites, and they are subsequently retracted during dark adaptation. In a retina kept under continuous illumination, the retraction process can be initiated by analogues of the neurotransmitter glutamate acting at AMPA/kainate receptors. On the other hand, the retraction process depends on calcium influx and the subsequent activation of CaMkII. We show here that the retraction of spinules induced by AMPA or kainate is not impaired in the presence of cobalt, making an involvement of voltage-gated calcium channels unlikely. Using calcium imaging techniques with isolated horizontal cells, we demonstrate that AMPA and kainate, but not NMDA, increase [Ca2+]i in the presence of nicardipine, caffeine and thapsigargin. The increase of [Ca2+]i under these conditions depends on [Ca2+]o and on the agonist in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that the increase of [Ca2+]i is largely due to calcium influx through the agonist-gated channel. Pharmacological studies were performed to determine whether AMPA- and/or kainate-preferring receptors mediate the calcium influx. The AMPA-preferring receptor antagonist LY303070 blocked glutamate- and kainate-evoked increases of [Ca2+]i in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating that kainate-preferring receptors contributed little or nothing to the observed [Ca2+]i increase. This was supported by experiments where cyclothiazide (which blocks the desensitization of AMPA receptors) and concanavalin A (which potentiates responses mediated by kainate receptors) were applied. In all cases, LY303070 blocked the agonist-evoked increase of [Ca2+]i. The presence of AMPA-preferring receptors with high Ca2+ permeability on horizontal cells was also supported by measuring agonist-induced currents using whole-cell recording techniques. Furthermore, LY303070 was able to impair the retraction of spinules during dark adaption in the in vivo situation.', 16202047: 'There is limited knowledge concerning tooth and gingival display in the maxillary premolar area during smiling. The purpose of this study was to investigate maxillary premolar and associated gingival display during smiling, and to reveal possible differences related to gender and age. The study consisted of 90 males and 113 females (mean age 38 years, s.d. = 13.83) receiving regular dental care. Two pictures of each subject, one with lips in maximum smile, and the other a retracted frontal view, were made. Clinical crown length, tooth and gingival display were measured for the left maxillary premolars. Central incisors and canines were used as controls. anova with Bonferroni post hoc multiple comparisons tests was used to assess any statistically significant impact of gender and age on tooth and gingival display, and determine differences among gender and age groups (at 5% significance level). Premolars were partially visible in more than 80% of the smiles, and displayed more than 65% of their clinical crown length during smiling. The least display (P < 0.001) was recorded for first and the greatest for second premolars. Tooth display was greater in females, but statistically significant only in central incisors (P < 0.05). No significant differences were revealed between age subgroups. Gingival display was greater for premolars compared with both central incisors (P < 0.001) and canines (P < 0.05). Displayed gingiva was found in first and second premolars in 44 and 49% of subjects, respectively. More gingival display was recorded in females and in younger subjects.', 9666400: 'This study investigated the mechanism of aortic regurgitation caused by dilatation of the sinotubular junction. The canine model of dilatation of the sinotubular junction was used to observe coaptation of the aortic valve using direct imaging by endoscopy. Five adult mongrel dogs (body weight: 20-25 kg) were anesthetized and their hearts and thoracic aortas were extracted en bloc. Aortotomy was performed and an interrupted horizontal mattress suture was placed in each commissure and each sinus of Valsalva at the level of the sinotubular junction. The heart and thoracic aorta were fixed on a table and the interrupted sutures were drawn horizontally. As a result, the aorta of the junction level was dilated. Strain of the interrupted sutures were changed by weights of 20, 25, 50, 70 and 100 points (1 point = 3.5 g). The sites of the retracted sutures were the three commissures and three sinuses of Valsalva. With increased strain of the sutures, the opening of the aortic valve was exaggerated when drawing was done on either all sutures or the commissures. When drawing was done only on the three sinuses of Valsalva, coaptation of the aortic valve was uninterrupted. This study showed that dilatation of the sinotubular junction causes aortic regurgitation, which is mainly due to the outward deviation of the commissures.', 9836873: \"We have determined the X-ray structures of the NADP(H)-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase of Clostridiim beijerinckii (CBADH) in the apo and holo-enzyme forms at 2.15 A and 2.05 A resolution, respectively, and of the holo-alcohol dehydrogenase of Thermoanaerobacter brockii (TBADH) at 2.5 A. These are the first structures of prokaryotic alcohol dehydrogenase to be determined as well as that of the first NADP(H)-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase. CBADH and TBADH 75% have sequence identity and very similar three-dimensional structures. Both are tetramers of 222 symmetry. The monomers are composed of two domains: a cofactor-binding domain and a catalytic domain. These are separated by a deep cleft at the bottom of which a single zinc atom is bound in the catalytic site. The tetramers are composed of two dimers, each structurally homologous to the dimer of alcohol dehydrogenases of vertebrates. The dimers form tetramers by means of contacts between surfaces opposite the interdomain cleft thus leaving it accessible from the surface of the tetramer. The tetramer encloses a large internal cavity with a positive surface potential. A molecule of NADP(H) binds in the interdomain cleft to the cofactor-binding domain of each monomer. The specificity of the two bacterial alcohol dehydrogenases toward NADP(H) is determined by residues Gly198, Ser199, Arg200 and Tyr218, with the latter three making hydrogen bonds with the 2'-phosphate oxygen atoms of the cofactor. Upon NADP(H) binding to CBADH, Tyr218 undergoes a rotation of approximately 120 degrees about chi1 which facilitates stacking interactions with the adenine moiety and hydrogen bonding with one of the phosphate oxygen atoms. In apo-CBADH the catalytic zinc is tetracoordinated by side-chains of residues Cys37, His59, Asp150 and Glu60; in holo-CBADH, Glu60 is retracted from zinc in three of the four monomers whereas in holo-TBADH, Glu60 does not participate in Zn coordination. In both holo-enzymes, but not in the apo-enzyme, residues Ser39 and Ser113 are in the second coordination sphere of the catalytic zinc. The carboxyl group of Asp150 is oriented with respect to the active carbon of NADP(H) so as to form hydrogen bonds with both pro-S and pro-R hydrogen atoms.\", 25334090: StringElement('While the number of meta-analyses published has increased recently, most of them have problems in the design, analysis, and/or presentation.

New pili were produced at a normal rate approximately 3 min after NaCN was removed. The adsorption of either F pili antibody or R17 bacteriophage to the sides of pili and temperatures below 24 C prevented retraction. The disappearance of pili was accompanied by a loss in the ability of cells to adsorb R17 phage and the type of F pili antibody that inhibits R17 phage infection and mating. The ability to adsorb M13 phage and the type of F pili antibody that inhibits M13 phage infection was not affected.

However, its use in ophthalmology is widely known and without quantitatively important side effects. A literature review was performed for side effects of MMC in the upper aerodigestive tract. Forty-six articles, describing the use of MMC to prevent scarring, were retracted from PubMed. Thirty-two are human studies. MMC is used in different concentrations (0.1-10\\xa0mg/ml) with different application times (2-5\\xa0min) and frequencies (up to 4 times). Five hundred and thirty-eight patients were included in those publications, of whom 19 developed side effects (3.53%). No side effects developed in studies, where post-application irrigation with saline was reported. The longest mean follow-up period is 75.5\\xa0months. Direct relations between the reported side effects and MMC seem absent in most studies. Serious complications seem to occur when MMC is used in high concentrations. Unfortunately, sometimes crucial information is lacking. One patient was described who supposedly developed laryngeal carcinoma after repeated treatment of hyperkeratosis and anterior commissure webbing. Animal studies show that excessive fibrin production can lead to acute airway obstruction. In conclusion, topical application of MMC on a wound with consecutive irrigation with saline can be performed safely to prevent scar formation in circular structures of the upper aerodigestive tract. Long-term yearly control of the application site seems advisable.', 19628771: 'Death-associated protein kinase (DAPK) is a serine/threonine kinase that contributes to pro-apoptotic signaling on cytokine exposure. The role of DAPK in macrophage-associated tumor cell death is currently unknown. Recently, we suggested a new function for DAPK in the induction of apoptosis during the interaction between colorectal tumor cells and tumor-associated macrophages. Using a cell-culture model with conditioned supernatants of differentiated/activated macrophages (U937) and human HCT116 colorectal tumor cells, we replicated DAPK-associated tumor cell death; this model likely reflects the in vivo tumor setting. In this study, we show that tumor necrosis factor-alpha exposure under conditions of macrophage activation induced DAPK-dependent apoptosis in the colorectal tumor cell line HCT116. Simultaneously, early phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (phospho-p38) was observed. We identified the phospho-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase as a novel interacting protein of DAPK in tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced apoptosis. The general relevance of this interaction was verified in two colorectal cell lines without functional p53 (ie, HCT116 p53(-/-) and HT29 mutant) and in human colon cancer and ulcerative colitis tissues. Supernatants of freshly isolated human macrophages were also able to induce DAPK and phospho-p38.

We observed more than three orders of magnitude enhancement in the fluorescence signal of a single molecule of goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate, FITC, (FITC-IgG) by two-photon excitation with these structures. These large enhancements in the fluorescence signal at the nanoscale gaps between the composite wrinkles corresponded to shortened lifetimes due to localized surface plasmons.

Following a midline skin incision, the cost-sterno complex (plastron) was dissected together with the bilateral rectus muscle pedicles, and the sternum was divided transversely through the second intercostal space.

In the early 1980s, post-vaccine encephalitis was reported in dogs from various parts of Britain after administration of a particular batch of combined CDV Rockborn strain/canine adenovirus type-1 vaccine, although incrimination of the Rockborn strain was subsequently retracted. Notwithstanding, this, and other reports, led to the view that the Rockborn strain is less attenuated and less safe than other CDV vaccines, and the Rockborn strain was officially withdrawn from the markets in the mid 1990s. By sequencing the H gene of the strain Rockborn from the 46th laboratory passage, and a commercial vaccine (Candur(\\xae) SH+P, Hoechst Rousell Vet GmbH), the virus was found to differ from the commonly used vaccine strain, Onderstepoort (93.0% nt and 91.7% aa), and to resemble more closely (99.6% nt and 99.3% aa) a CDV strain detected in China from a Lesser Panda (Ailurus fulgens). An additional four CDV strains matching (>99% nt identity) the Rockborn virus were identified in the sequence databases. Also, Rockborn-like strains were identified in two vaccines currently in the market. These findings indicate that Rockborn-like viruses may be recovered from dogs or other carnivores with distemper, suggesting cases of residual virulence of vaccines, or circulation of vaccine-derived Rockborn-like viruses in the field.', 22385006: 'Five percent of the general population has olfactory or gustatory disorders, although most do not complain about it. However, in some cases, these symptoms can be disabling and may affect quality of life. Anosmia was reported as a possible complication following head injury and neurosurgical procedures, particularly after the resection of tumors located in the anterior fossa and the treatment of aneurysms in the anterior circulation. Nonetheless, in all of these situations, olfactory dysfunction could be explained by damage to the peripheral olfactory system. Here, the authors report a case of complete anosmia associated with ageusia following awake resection of a low-grade glioma involving the left temporoinsular region, with no recovery during a follow-up of 3 years. The frontal lobe was not retracted, and the olfactory tract was not visualized during surgery; therefore, postoperative anosmia and ageusia are likely explained by damage to the cortex and central pathways responsible for these senses. The authors suggest that the patient might have had a subclinical right hemianosmia before surgery, which is a common condition. After resection of the central structures critical for smell and taste processing in the left hemisphere, the patient could have finally had bilateral and complete olfactory and gustatory loss.

CD-1 mice were anesthetized and placed in a lateral decubitus position. A 10mm midline longitudinal incision was made over the thyroid bone. The omohyoid and sternomastoid muscles were retracted to expose the common carotid artery and external carotid artery (ECA). To maximize delivery of administered agents, the superior thyroid artery was ligated or coagulated, and the occipital artery and the pterygopalatine artery (PPA) were temporarily occluded with 6-0 prolene suture. The ECA was carefully dissected and a permanent ligature was placed on its distal segment while a temporary 6-0 prolene ligature was placed on the proximal segment in order to obtain a flow-free segment of vessel. A sterilized 169 \\u03bcm outer diameter polyimide microcatheter was introduced into the ECA and advanced in retrograde fashion toward the carotid bifurcation.

Survival rates were dependent on the administered agent and ranged from 78 to 90%.

The FIB creates a cross section and subsequently removes thin slices. The SEM takes images using secondary or backscattered electrons, or maps every slice using X-rays and/or electron backscatter diffraction patterns. The objective of this study is to assess the possibilities of combining FIB-SEM tomography with cathodoluminescence (CL) imaging. The intensity of CL emission is related to variations in defect or impurity concentrations. A potential problem with FIB-SEM CL tomography is that ion milling may change the defect state of the material and the CL emission. In addition the conventional tilted sample geometry used in FIB-SEM tomography is not compatible with conventional CL detectors. Here we examine the influence of the FIB on CL emission in natural diamond and the feasibility of FIB-SEM CL tomography. A systematic investigation establishes that the ion beam influences CL emission of diamond, with a dependency on both the ion beam and electron beam acceleration voltage. CL emission in natural diamond is enhanced particularly at low ion beam and electron beam voltages. This enhancement of the CL emission can be partly explained by an increase in surface defects induced by ion milling. CL emission enhancement could be used to improve the CL image quality. To conduct FIB-SEM CL tomography, a recently developed novel specimen geometry is adopted to enable sequential ion milling and CL imaging on an untilted sample. We show that CL imaging can be manually combined with FIB-SEM tomography with a modified protocol for 3D microstructure reconstruction. In principle, automated FIB-SEM CL tomography should be feasible, provided that dedicated CL detectors are developed that allow subsequent milling and CL imaging without manual intervention, as the current CL detector needs to be manually retracted before a slice can be milled. Due to the required high electron beam acceleration voltage for CL emission, the resolution for FIB-SEM CL tomography is currently limited to several hundreds of nm in XY and up to 650 nm in Z for diamonds. Opaque materials are likely to have an improved Z resolution, as CL emission generated deeper in the material is not able to escape from it.', 24456256: StringElement('Workplaces need to foster teaching and learning interactions so staff collaborate and learn from each other.

Human umbilical vein endothelial cells at passage 2 were exposed to nickel and zinc ion solutions ranging from 1 to 0.01 mM for 4 and 24 h. Cells were seeded on fibronectin precoated glass slides or in tissue culture quality 96-well plates. MTT conversion with 1 and 0.5 mM nickel and zinc was strongly depressed, indicating that these concentrations are cytotoxic. Proliferative activity was also affected by these concentrations. Cells exposed to zinc typically retracted and detached from the surface, whereas cells exposed to nickel remained on the surface without signs of retraction. Nevertheless, cells exposed to nickel were impaired to reach confluency, which was determined by cadherin-5 expression. All these data indicate that nickel ions at a sufficient concentration influence cells in a cytotoxic way. Despite this apparent cytotoxicity, focal adhesion distribution as visualized by immunofluorescence staining of vinculin was not affected. With zinc the morphological changes were accompanied by apparent fusion of focal adhesions during retraction and finally dissolution. These data indicate that the mere presence of focal adhesions does not allow a reliable statement about the functional status of a cell. On the other hand, when focal adhesions are affected it is an excellent monitor of disturbed cell function.', 28045714: StringElement('Pasireotide was recently shown to decrease leak rates after pancreatic resection, though the significant cost of the drug may be prohibitive.

The plasmin, staphylokinase complex, unlike the plasmin, streptokinase complex, is rapidly inhibited by alpha 2-antiplasmin. In a plasma milieu, staphylokinase is able to dissolve fibrin clots without associated fibrinogen degradation. This fibrin-specificity of staphylokinase is the result of reduced inhibition by alpha 2-antiplasmin of plasmin, staphylokinase complex bound to fibrin, recycling of staphylokinase from the plasmin, staphylokinase complex following inhibition by alpha 2-antiplasmin, and prevention of the conversion of plasminogen, staphylokinase to plasmin, staphylokinase by alpha 2-antiplasmin. In several experimental animal models, staphylokinase appears to be equipotent to streptokinase for the dissolution of whole blood or plasma clots, but significantly more potent for the dissolution of platelet-rich or retracted thrombi. The feasibility of fibrin-specific coronary thrombolysis with an intravenous infusion over 30 min of 10 mg recombinant staphylokinase was demonstrated in two small pilot studies in patients with acute myocardial infarction with angiographically confirmed total occlusion of the infarct-related coronary artery. However, neutralizing antibodies against staphylokinase were demonstrable from the third week on in all patients. Definition of the therapeutic benefit of recombinant staphylokinase will require more detailed dose-finding studies followed by randomized efficacy studies against other thrombolytic agents. An interim analysis after 50 patients of a randomized trial of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator versus staphylokinase in patients with acute myocardial infarction revealed similar rates of coronary patency at 90 minutes but a significantly higher fibrin specificity of the latter compound.', 3443111: 'When included in a free floating collagen lattice, several types of cells and fibroblasts attach to the collagen polymers, retract the gel, and their biosynthetic activity is repressed. Under similar conditions transformed pulmonary epithelial rat (PER) cells are unable to attach to the fibers and to significantly retract the lattice. Retraction can be induced by adding fibronectin (fn) and factor XIII (FXIII) together. This effect is fibronectin dose dependent and observed with a maximum efficiency for FXIII concentrations of 0.1 U/ml and above. Fibronectin or FXIII alone has only a limited effect on retraction. This experimental model allowed us to study the biosynthetic activity of PER cells under various degrees of cell interaction (control less than FXIII less than fn less than fn + FXIII) with their three-dimensional collagen support. The more the cells interacted with their support and retracted the gel, the more protein and collagen synthesis were reduced. This effect was observed for the products deposited in the cell layer and for those released in the medium. Increasing collagen concentration in a nonretracting lattice to a final density obtained in a maximally retracted lattice resulted in a much lower repression of biosynthetic activity. Fn and FXIII added at the same concentrations in monolayer cultures did not produce significant modification in biosynthetic activities. We propose that the regulation of the biosynthetic activity of adherent cells contracting the lattice is related to mechanical information resulting from the interactions between the cells and their support.', 12171229: 'Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) comprises a complex of symptoms in the hand, including pain and paresthesia and weakness of hand muscles thought to result from compression of the median nerve. Many clinicians either refer patients for electrodiagnostic studies to aid diagnosis or conduct electrodiagnostic studies, which may be useful as an aid to decisions on treatment. The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the evidence base for the use of electrodiagnostic tests in the diagnosis and management of carpal tunnel syndrome. A systematic search was undertaken for studies that included patients with clinical diagnosis of CT5 who were undergoing electrodiagnostic tests and surgery together with reported outcomes of surgery. A published systematic review found that electrodiagnosis was not a useful diagnostic test in patients with clinical signs of CTS. Seven primary studies of prognosis reporting electrodiagnosis and surgery outcomes were found, however, one of them was subsequently retracted. The remaining six were retrospective case senes of poor quality. Four of these studies reported outcomes of surgery in patients with clinically identified CTS, comparing both positive or negative electrodiagnostic results. No study found any statistical difference in surgical outcome between those who were electrodiagnostic test positive and those who were negative. Despite the limited quality of the evidence, in cases of clear-cut clinical CTS, electrodiagnosis is not warranted either as a diagnostic test, where clinical symptoms are well defined, or as a predictive indicator of surgical outcome. It may still be useful in cases where the clinical diagnosis is not clear.', 7670189: 'PS-990, which is a novel microbial metabolite, induced neurite formation in a murine neuroblastoma cell line, Neuro2A. In the presence of PS-990 at 30 micrograms/ml, significant neurite outgrowth was observed. Cultures maintained for 12 h in the presence of PS-990 resulted in the maximal number of neurite-bearing cells, and then the neurites formed were gradually retracted. The retracted cells again yielded the neurite formation when the cells were exposed again to PS-990. PS-990 inhibited both the cell growth and thymidine incorporation into the cells at the same concentration range. Although the type of neurite formation with PS-990 is similar to that with a cyclic AMP analog and indeed PS-990 has an inhibitory potency against calcium and calmodulin-dependent cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, the intracellular cyclic AMP level was not elevated when treated with PS-990. These results suggest that PS-990 reversibly induces neurite formation with arrest of the cell growth through a mechanism distinct from an increase in the intracellular cyclic AMP concentration.', 16224689: 'Phenotypic plasticity is a key factor for the success of organisms in heterogeneous environments. Although many forms of phenotypic plasticity can be induced and retracted repeatedly, few extant models have analyzed conditions for the evolution of reversible plasticity. We present a general model of reversible plasticity to examine how plastic shifts in the mode and breadth of environmental tolerance functions (that determine relative fitness) depend on time lags in response to environmental change, the pattern of individual exposure to inducing and noninducing environments, and the quality of available information about the environment. We couched the model in terms of prey-induced responses to variable predation regimes. With longer response lags relative to the rate of environmental change, the modes of tolerance functions in both the presence or absence of predators converge on a generalist strategy that lies intermediate between the optimal functions for the two environments in the absence of response lags. Incomplete information about the level of predation risk in inducing environments causes prey to have broader tolerance functions even at the cost of reduced maximal fitness. We give a detailed analysis of how these factors and interactions among them select for joint patterns of mode and breadth plasticity.', 11889395: StringElement('To develop a prosthesis-free medialization laryngoplasty for the treatment of glottal incompetence.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'OBJECTIVE', u'Label': u'OBJECTIVE'}), 23423413: StringElement('Hydroxyethyl starch is commonly used for volume resuscitation yet has been associated with serious adverse events, including acute kidney injury and death.

With the light microscope, the cells positive with antiserum to ovine luteinizing hormone (A-oLH) were violet after the Alcian blue-periodic acid-Schiff (AB-PAS) staining; they were also positive for A-oLHalpha and for A-oLHbeta and, from castrated males, they displayed an increased affinity for A-oLHbeta. Another cell type which was blue after the AB-PAS method reacted with the A-oLHalpha only; these cells, presumably thyrotropic cells, were retracted after castration and, besides their affinity for A-oLHalpha, acquired an affinity for A-oLHbeta. As seen through the electron microscope, two cell types were positive for A-oLH, A-oLHbeta, and A-oLHalpha and may be identified as luteinizing hormone-secreting cells. Type A cells were characterized by two classes of rounded, secretory granules. Type B cells were smaller and contained only small secretory granules. 1 mo after the rats were castrated the type A cells were hypertrophied and vacuolized. In both cases the secretory granules were the main sites of the antigenicity with the three antisera. A positive reaction was also found in the cytoplasm, particularly in hypertrophied cells from ovariectomized females and with A-oLHbeta. The cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum were usually negative, except in highly degranulated cells from ovariectomized females and with A-oLHbeta.', 10488264: 'Michael L. Millenson\\'s well-documented book, Demanding Medical Excellence: Doctors and Accountability in the Information Age, is a wake up call to both medicine and nursing for somewhat different reasons. Millenson decries the lack of scientific-based medical practice and medicine\\'s failure to wake up due to its own historical studies. He cites data that 85% of current practice has not been scientifically validated despite medicine\\'s claims of the physician-scientist. He outlines a historical chronology of advocacy for better practice based on concerns and studies that demonstrates significant differences in patient outcomes, adjusted for case mix, across hospitals studied. Millenson advocates the development of a broader base of benchmarking and best practices, reflected in clinical practice guidelines, recognizing the resistance of physicians to their use. He further advocates incorporating more fully information-age computers in the delivery of quality care by programming them to the tasks they are best suited for in informing and alerting us to flawed memories, orders, and abnormal laboratory and radiologic data. The relevance of Millenson\\'s book to CRNAs and nursing in general is twofold: (1) He discusses the National Halothane Study and the subsequent Stanford Institutional Differences Study. The latter study confirmed what was found in the National Halothane Study concerning significant differences in patient outcomes across studied hospitals but did not address the role of the hospital\\'s primary anesthesia provider, anesthesiologists, or CRNAs in these differences, as did the latter. He addresses the lack of publication and dissemination of the institutional outcome differences of these studies performed in the 1960s and 1970s, but he does not address the anesthesia provider portion of the Stanford Study. (2) While Millenson does mention nursing briefly and advocates its involvement in clinical practice guideline development, he does not discuss the profession\\'s own concerns about the lack of scientific validation of our nursing practice. Research serves as a principal cornerstone for scientifically based clinical practice guidelines or best practices. Millenson and others address some of the problems associated with current research and the problems associated with the peer review system in the publication of methodologically flawed and politically motivated published studies. The Abenstein and Warner study in Anesthesia and Analgesia in 1996 is a prime example of the latter. A recent British Medical Journal editorial characterized medical literature as disorganized and biased (BMJ.1998;317[7152]:160). It further cites a study that found that over 95% of articles in medical journals did not meet minimum standards for quality or clinical relevance. While that figure may be high, we know that flawed and biased research is within the MEDLINE database, even though some studies have been retracted based on overt fraud. However, retraction has not stopped other researchers or practitioners from publishing retracted research in their own publications. Consumers of MEDLINE should be aware of this problem and be prepared to question the validity of research prior to adopting their conclusions. In the development of \"best practices,\" flawed research may be as bad as personal biases and flawed memories. The potential adverse implications of flawed research for scientifically (evidenced) based practice and for health policy decisions by government and health payers with regard to the delivery of health services and its reimbursement requires that all involved do a better job of assuring that only valid, methodologically sound, and unbiased research is published, is included in the MEDLINE database, and is used in the care afforded to people in need.', 21324233: 'To determine the ultrastructural changes of sheep cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) following different methods of vitrification, good quality isolated COCs (GV stage) were randomly divided into the non-vitrified control, conventional straw, cryotop and solid surface vitrification groups. In both conventional and cryotop methods, vitrified COCs were respectively loaded by conventional straws and cryotops, and then plunged directly into liquid nitrogen (LN2); whereas in the solid surface group, vitrified COCs were first loaded by cryotops and then cooled before plunging into LN2. Post-warming survivability and ultrastructural changes of healthy COCs in the cryotop group especially in comparison with the conventional group revealed better viability rate and good preservation of the ooplasm organization. However in all vitrification groups except the cryotop group, mitochondria were clumped. Solely in the conventional straw group, the mitochondria showed different densities and were extremely distended. Moreover in the latter group, plenty of large irregular connected vesicles in the ooplasm were observed and in some parts their membrane ruptured. Also, in the conventional and solid surface vitrification groups, cumulus cells projections became retracted from the zona pellucida in some parts. In conclusion, the cryotop vitrification method as compared with other methods seems to have a good post-warming survivability and shows less deleterious effects on the ultrastructure of healthy vitrified-warmed sheep COCs.', 15733198: \"Media coverage of the 2003 Iraq War frequently contained corrections and retractions of earlier information. For example, claims that Iraqi forces executed coalition prisoners of war after they surrendered were retracted the day after the claims were made. Similarly, tentative initial reports about the discovery of weapons of mass destruction were all later disconfirmed. We investigated the effects of these retractions and disconfirmations on people's memory for and beliefs about war-related events in two coalition countries (Australia and the United States) and one country that opposed the war (Germany). Participants were queried about (a) true events, (b) events initially presented as fact but subsequently retracted, and (c) fictional events. Participants in the United States did not show sensitivity to the correction of misinformation, whereas participants in Australia and Germany discounted corrected misinformation. Our results are consistent with previous findings in that the differences between samples reflect greater suspicion about the motives underlying the war among people in Australia and Germany than among people in the United States.\", 6750672: \"First, the author describes the suprapubic deepithelialized triangular flap to eliminate the dead space that can result when the abdominal flap, elevated from the periumbilical zone, meager in fatty tissue, is sutured to the thick pubic region. Second, because of the frequently poor quality of circular periumbilical scars, the author proposes a superiorly based, round-shaped flap taken from the future umbilical location and then defatted. The umbilical cylinder is divided vertically down to its aponeurotic attachment to permit insertion of this round skin flap, which is then anchored to the aponeurosis and to the edge of the triangular gap. This method prevents retracted periumbilical scars. Finally, in secondary corrections after abdominoplasty, satisfactory results can be obtained only if the umbilicus is detached from either the skin or the aponeurosis. The author's technique for covering the hole at the old umbilical location makes use of a round flap from the new umbilical site.\", 8161747: 'Rupture of the ulnar collateral ligament (LCU) is the result of traumatic abduction of the metacarpophalangeal joint of the thumb (\"skier\\'s thumb\"). If the ligament becomes retracted superficially to the adductor aponeurosis, surgical treatment is advocated, non-displaced tears can be treated by immobilization. Differentiation between displaced and non-displaced tears by radiography is not possible. We examined 45 patients to assess whether sonography was of help in this respect. The retracted LCU appeared as a hypoechogenic, mostly round structure medial to the metacarpal head. Using this criterion, 86% of retracted ruptures could be diagnosed correctly. Although intact LCU and nondisplaced tear cannot be differentiated consistently by sonography, high sensitivity in diagnosis of retracted ruptures seems promising, as it enables specific planning of therapeutic decisions.', 342492: 'The effects of high temperatures (46 to 50 degrees C) on the production of F pili by Escherichia coli were studied by electron microscopy. Attached F pili rapidly disappeared at 48 and 50 degrees C but not at 46 degrees C. Free pili were not denatured at these temperatures. The pili that disappeared from the cells at 50 degrees C did not appear as free pili in the culture supernatant fluid, indicating that the pili had retracted to the cell surface or into the cell. The adsorption of either R17 phage or F pili antibody to the sides of pili prevented retraction. The disappearance of pili was accompanied by a loss in the ability to adsorb R17 phage but not M13 phage, suggesting that the tip of a pilus remains exposed after retraction.', 23093726: StringElement('In daily practice, we discovered one of the secondary magnetic resonance (MR) findings of the subscapularis (SSC) tendon tear, the \"bridging sign\", which has not been previously described.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'BACKGROUND', u'Label': u'BACKGROUND'}), 3367396: 'Laminin promotes attachment and process formation in the neuroblastoma X glioma hybrid cell line NG108-15. As cells attached to laminin, they flattened and remained dispersed rather than associated in clumps. Process formation was observed within 1 hr after exposure to laminin and was dose dependent. Cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, did not block laminin-mediated attachment and neurite formation. Addition of drugs that depolymerize the cytoskeleton led to different behaviors for cells grown on plastic compared with those in the presence of laminin. Cells on plastic treated with either vinblastine or cytochalasin neither flattened nor grew processes. Cells plus laminin and vinblastine retracted processes, but remained flat, suggesting that laminin-induced processes can be destabilized by disrupting microtubules. Cells sequentially treated with laminin and cytochalasin produced processes that were thin and highly branched. Cells in high concentrations of cytochalasin on a laminin substrate formed aberrant processes even when their soma did not flatten. Since laminin counteracted the effect of cytochalasin on process outgrowth but did not alter the effect of cytochalasin on flattening of the cell body, different mechanisms mediated by microfilaments may be involved in cell flattening and in process formation.', 11520488: 'Brain connections depend on a stable association between dendrites and axons whose cytoskeleton is stabilized by the proteins MAP-2 and tau, respectively. The glial protein S-100beta inhibits the phosphorylation by PKC of these two microtubule-associated proteins. In order to determine if exogenous S-100beta can directly influence the cytoskeleton of living cells, cultures of N-18 cells (neuroblastoma clonal cell line) are treated for 30 min in serum-free medium with 10(-6) M colchicine. In normal media, colchicine induces a rapid retraction of processes, membrane blebbing, nuclear collapse, and cell death. The observed cellular changes, due to cytoskeletal collapse after exposure to colchicine, are similar and consistent with the loss of processes and cytoplasmic blebbing seen in cells undergoing apoptosis. The addition of 20 ng/ml of S-100beta after the initial 30-min exposure to colchicine prevents apoptosis, nuclear collapse and induces the regrowth of retracted processes. Cells were treated with the Hoechst Stain, a fluorescent marker that binds to nuclear material, to determine the occurrence of apoptosis in our cultures. In our control cultures, receiving no drugs, we found that 15.1% of the cells were apoptotic. When colchicine was added to the culture medium we found that 31.6% of the cells became apoptotic. However, when colchicine was followed by exposure to S-100beta we found that only 5.4% of the cells were apoptotic. Our results suggest that extracellular application of the glial protein S-100beta is sufficient to reverse colchicine-induced cytoskeletal collapse and prevent the resultant apoptosis of the cells. The increased levels of S-100beta seen after brain injury and in certain neurological and psychiatric disorders may be considered as beneficial for brain recovery.', 22809083: StringElement('Renilla Luciferase reporter gene (rLuc) GL4.82 and GL4.13 promoter are key player in transfection, but precise knowledge of its targets in colon cancer remains limited.

Chordotonal organs perform proprioceptive and other mechanosensory functions in insects and crustaceans. The mechanical properties of these organs are believed to be adapted to the sensory functions, but had not been probed directly. We measured mechanical properties of a particular chordotonal organ-the lateral pentascolopidial (lch5) organ of Drosophila larvae-which plays a key role in proprioceptive locomotion control. We applied tension to the whole organ in\\xa0situ by transverse deflection. Upon release of force, the organ displayed overdamped relaxation with two widely separated time constants, tens of milliseconds and seconds, respectively. When the muscles covering the lch5 organ were excised, the slow relaxation was absent, and the fast relaxation became faster. Interestingly, most of the strain in the stretched organ is localized in the cap cells, which account for two-thirds of the length of the entire organ, and could be stretched by \\u223c10% without apparent damage. In laser ablation experiments we found that cap cells retracted by \\u223c100 \\u03bcm after being severed from the neurons, indicating considerable steady-state stress and strain in these cells.

One antibody recognized a protein distinguished by its strong accumulation at the tips of filopods. These cell-surface extensions containing a core of bundled actin filaments are rapidly protruded and retracted by cells in the growth-phase stage. The protein of 269 kD turned out to resemble mouse fibroblast talin (Rees et al., 1990) in its primary structure. The fit is best among the first 400-amino acid residues of the NH2-terminal region where identity between the two proteins is 44% and the last 200-amino acid residues of the COOH-terminal region with 36% identity. In the elongated cells of the aggregation stage the Dictyostelium talin is accumulated at the entire front where also F-actin is enriched. Since this protein exists in a soluble state in the cytoplasm, mechanisms are predicted that cause accumulation at sites of the cell where a front is established. Evidence for receptor-mediated accumulation was obtained by local stimulation of cells with cAMP. When a new front was induced by the chemoattractant, the talin accumulated there within half a minute, indicating a signal cascade in Dictyostelium responsible for assembly of the talin beneath sites of the plasma membrane where chemoattractant receptors are strongly activated. The ordered assembly of the talin homologue together with actin and a series of other proteins is considered to play a key role in chemotactic orientation.', 23839836: u'We examined the dose-related effects of nicardipine on the diaphragmatic fatigability in 24 anesthetized, mechanically ventilated dogs.

Diaphragmatic fatigue was induced by intermittent supramaximal bilateral electrophrenic stimulation at a frequency of 20 Hz applied for 30 min. In groups N1 and N2, nicardipine was continuoulsy infused intravenously during this fatigueproducing period. Diaphragmatic contractility was assessed by changes in transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi). After induction of diaphragmatic stimulation at low-frequency (20 Hz), Pdi decreased significantly in all groups compared with the prefatigue value (P<0.05), whereas no change was observed in Pdi at high-frequency (100 Hz) stimulation. The Pdi at 20 Hz stimulation was significantly lower in groups N1 and N2 compared with that in group C (P<0.05). The decrease in Pdi at 20 Hz stimulation was significantly larger in group N2 than in group N1 (P<0.05). The speed of recovery of Pdi at 20 Hz stimulation was dose dependent. The integrated diaphragmatic electric activity (Edi) in each group did not change at any frequency of stimulation throughout the study.

Rats received ten daily sessions each consisting of ten lever presentations. Nicotine (0.25-0.8 mg/kg SC) administration, either 15 min prior to (pre-session) or immediately after (post-session) the daily autoshaping sessions, caused a significant dose-related impairment of acquisition with the post-session injections having the greater effect. Low doses of nicotine (0.025-0.1 mg/kg SC) had little effect on acquisition when injected pre-session or post-session. Injections of 0.45 mg/kg nicotine either immediately (t = 0) or at +5 min after the daily sessions impaired acquisition of the lever-touch response.

Post-session injections of nicotine did not alter the lever-touch behavior of well-trained animals, but suppressed responding in animals that were partially trained. Thus, nicotine-induced impairment of the autoshaped lever-touch response is dose dependent, centrally mediated, occurs within 5 min of a SC injection, and may interfere with post-training consolidation processes.', 28095024: StringElement('The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of ampullary MDCT in the noninvasive, preoperative differentiation of pancreatobiliary and intestinal subtypes of ampullary adenocarcinoma.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'OBJECTIVE', u'Label': u'OBJECTIVE'}), 20228659: StringElement('We sought to determine the type and incidence of ostomy-related complications and identify associated factors in Korean ostomy patients.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'OBJECTIVE', u'Label': u'PURPOSE'}), 28455482: \"Post-operative neuropathy after total hip arthroplasty.

Inhibitors of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase subfamily type 4 (PDE-4), hLH and hFSH provoked this reversible cAMP-dependent phenotype in a temporal-, spatial- and dose-dependent manner. Gi/o inhibited adenylyl cyclase in membranes, and cell treatment with islet-activating protein (IAP) caused the cAMP-dependent retracted phenotype. It is concluded that the basal intracellular cAMP level is kept within a narrow range of concentrations, below the threshold for disassembly of stress fibres, through Gs, Gi/o, adenylyl cyclases and phosphodiesterase-4. This work supports the paradigm that switching of the agonist-occupied receptors to Gs and Gi/o would control both the intracellular bursts of cAMP (through the gonadotropin-catalysed activation of Gs) and the basal cAMP (through a Gi/o-mediated braking effect).', 2382397: 'Serial recordings of sensory evoked potentials (SEP) generated in response to stimulation of each tibial nerve were obtained from 23 anesthetized dogs. Five dogs were anesthetized for 3 hours to evaluate changes in serial SEP during general anesthesia. Nonsurgical and surgical manipulations were performed on one hind limb of five dogs to determine the effects of limb positioning and nerve retraction on SEP. In 13 dogs, the ischiatic nerve was exposed surgically and retracted until the SEP deteriorated and disappeared, to determine the relationship between amount of tension on the nerve and the time to complete deterioration of the SEP. Sensory evoked potential waveforms, which consisted of two to five peaks, were stable throughout the anesthetic period. The first two peaks were the most stable. Latency of the first two peaks was the easiest and most reliable parameter to evaluate. Although the peak latency in recordings from the superior hind limb was always slightly longer, SEP recordings from the inferior limb were good controls to monitor nerve function. There was considerable variation in sensitivity to nerve retraction. The technique proved to be a reliable way to monitor nerve function in normal anesthetized dogs.', 7045695: u\"Intermediate filaments (IF) constitute a major cytoplasmic filamentous network of higher eukaryotic cells that is distinct from actin and myosin microfilaments or microtubules. Although structurally similar, these filaments are formed by chemically and antigenically different proteins. Vimentin is the major IF polypeptide of mesenchymal cells and cultured non-mesenchymal cell lines. Recently, we have characterized a monoclonal IgM antibody from a patient with Waldenstr\\xf6m's macroglobulinaemia which is directed against vimentin. Using this monoclonal antibody, we have shown by direct immunofluorescence that intermediate filaments of human B and T lymphocytes consist of vimentin. In cells exposed to colcemid, the intermediate filaments retracted into a juxtanuclear aggregate ('coli') characteristic of vimentin filaments. As most components of the cytoskeleton, especially actin and myosin, have been implicated in the capping phenomenon, we investigated the effect of capping of either beta 2-microglobulin or membrane immunoglobulins on the organization of the intermediate filament network. We report that capping of these surface molecules induced the redistribution of vimentin just beneath the cap. When colcemid-treated cells were allowed to cap, the location of the cap always coincided with the coil, suggesting that the anchorage point of intermediate filaments is situated within the uropod.\", 21365314: StringElement('Pleural and abdominal pressure are clinically estimated by measuring the esophageal and bladder or intragastric pressure (IGP), respectively.

In 2015 and 2016 dedicated surveys were executed to study the progression of ocean heating and ecosystem response. We describe ecosystem response to multiple, consecutive years of ocean warming and offer perspective on the broader impacts. Ecosystem changes observed include reduced spring phytoplankton biomass over the southeast Bering Sea shelf relative to the north, lower abundances of large-bodied crustacean zooplankton taxa, and degraded feeding and body condition of age-0 walleye pollock. This suggests poor ecosystem conditions for young pollock production and the risk of significant decline in the number of pollock available to the pollock fishery in 2-3 years. However, we also noted that high quality prey, large copepods and euphausiids, and lower temperatures in the north may have provided a refuge from poor conditions over the southern shelf, potentially buffering the impact of a sequential-year warm stanza on the Bering Sea pollock population. We offer the hypothesis that juvenile (age-0, age-1) pollock may buffer deleterious warm stanza effects by either utilizing high productivity waters associated with the strong, northerly Cold Pool, as a refuge from the warm, low production areas of the southern shelf, or by exploiting alternative prey over the southern shelf. We show that in 2015, the ocean waters influenced by spring sea ice (the Cold Pool) supported robust phytoplankton biomass (spring) comprised of centric diatom chains, a crustacean copepod community comprised of large-bodied taxa (spring, summer), and a large aggregation of midwater fishes, potentially young pollock. In this manner, the Cold Pool may have acted as a trophic refuge in that year. The few age-0 pollock occurring over the southeast shelf consumed high numbers of euphausiids which may have provided a high quality alternate prey. In 2016 a retracted Cold Pool precluded significant refuging in the north, though pollock foraging on available euphausiids over the southern shelf may have mitigated the effect of warm waters and reduced large availability of large copepods. This work presents the hypothesis that, in the short term, juvenile pollock can mitigate the drastic impacts of sustained warming. This short-term buffering, combined with recent observations (2017) of renewed sea ice presence over southeast Bering Sea shelf and a potential return to average or at least cooler ecosystem conditions, suggests that recent warm year stanza (2014-2016) effects to the pollock population and fishery may be mitigated.', 22743633: StringElement('Treatment of tumors of the pelvic girdle by resection of part or all of the innominate bone with preservation of the extremity.

Cells, grown in the presence of, or on, root surfaces pretreated with 100-200 micrograms SSE/ml, partially retracted from the substratum and exhibited extensive surface blebbing and finger-like protrusions. Immunofluorescent staining showed that the morphological effects of Bacteroides gingivalis SSE are directed specifically at actin stress fibers and not microtubules of the cytoskeleton. Exposure to the SSE resulted in a dramatic relocalization of the bulk of F-actin from a fibrous form to a non-aggregated diffuse form. Disorganization of actin stress fibres occurred at concentrations of SSE that inhibited cell growth, but preceded any observable changes in cell attachment or morphology. The microtubular network remained intact, although it stained less intensely than that of controls.

This antibody was previously found to disturb the adhesion of several classes of fibroblasts and muscle. Here we report its effects upon neuronal-substrate adhesion. Two sources of neurons were investigated--the dorsal root and ciliary ganglia. Both responded similarly. Neurons plated in the presence of the CSAT Mab did not adhere to the substratum and process formation was inhibited completely for at least 24-48 hr. In explant cultures, when neurons were first allowed to extend processes prior to addition of the CSAT Mab, the results depended on the particular substrate. With some substrates, the neurites bundled and detached from the substratum; with others, they retracted and regrew to form large fascicles or bundles of processes. In dissociated cultures that already had extended processes, neurites fasciculated and cell bodies aggregated in response to the presence of the CSAT Mab. The magnitude of this response varied, depending upon the substrate. The antigen was localized, using immunofluorescence, on neuronal cell bodies, axons, and growth cones. This distribution correlated with its biological effects on all parts of the neuron. The antigen was isolated from neuronal cultures by immunoaffinity purification. It migrated in the molecular weight range of 140 kDa on reducing SDS-PAGE. This antigen is very similar to that isolated from fibroblasts, which is an integral membrane glycoprotein complex.

Average axial resolution changes from 5.0 mm FWHM at the center to 8.1 mm at R = 20 cm.

Successful cure of hypercalcemia is less frequent whereas complications are more common compared to initial explorations. Of 212 patients operated on at the Mayo Clinic from 1978 through 1986, 189 (89%) were cured. Sporadic disease, multiple endocrine neoplasia, and familial hyperparathyroidism were found in 183 (87%), 20 (9%), and 9 (4%) patients, respectively. Prior to the most recent reoperation, these patients had undergone from one to five operations. Preoperative localization examinations were performed in 192 patients (91%). Cervical high-resolution, real-time ultrasonography, computed tomography, and thallium-technetium scintigraphy had sensitivity rates of 87%, 56%, and 71%, respectively. When the tumor was localized preoperatively, the operative time and cost were significantly reduced compared to nonlocalized tumors. Cervical reexploration only was required in 154 (72%), combined cervical and mediastinal exploration occurred in 46 (22%), and mediastinal exploration only was performed in 12 (6%). There was no perioperative mortality; permanent hypoparathyroidism developed in 33 patients (16%), and six patients (2.9%) suffered permanent unilateral vocal cord paralysis. Anatomically, the most frequent site to find a missed parathyroid adenoma was in the normal location. The large majority of these glands were removed through a cervical incision although, on occasion, they were retracted from the anterior superior mediastinum or the low tracheoesophageal space. These data confirm that reoperative parathyroid surgery can be performed safely, with a rather high degree of success, but too-frequently results in a lifetime morbidity of hypoparathyroidism.', 10029670: 'The 1986 Chernobyl disaster contaminated vast regions of Ukraine and Belarus with a variety of radioactive isotopes and heavy metals. While over 90% of the radioactive isotopes have decayed into stable compounds, radiation levels in contaminated areas are still extraordinarily high. In fact, some rodents living near the reactor have internal 134,137Cs concentrations approaching 80 000 Bq/g. Several recent genetic analyses of vertebrates have illustrated that mutation rates of organisms exposed to radiation from Chernobyl are higher than in control groups, but none have studied DNA sequences. Nucleotide sequences of rodent mitochondrial genes were originally reported to have been hypervariable, but those results were subsequently retracted. Herein, I report the results of a pilot study to determine the extent of nucleotide variation at the p53 gene in four species of rodents (voles) from Chernobyl and from control sites. I sequenced a 788 bp region (coding and non-coding) of p53 in 30 different mice comprising four different species of Microtus. Nucleotide variation at the population level was due to deletions and substitutions; both were limited to introns. There were no significant differences between the number of haplotypes in radioactive and control populations (p=0.60). Rare or private alleles might have arisen due to unique mutational pressures at Chernobyl. Alternatively, natural selection might have favored one allele over others (i.e., a selective sweep). Neither scenario is strongly supported by these data. Thus, no apparent genetic effects of the Chernobyl disaster on the p53 gene of resident voles were revealed; more extensive surveys will be necessary to determine if mutation rates are indeed elevated in mice from Chernobyl. However, two salient points emerge; the first involves the utility of introns as markers for mutations in coding regions and the second considers the relative merits of cloning in mutation detection studies.', 17042025: StringElement('Massive rotator cuff tears provide a challenge for effective rehabilitation.

The model is inspired by the bipedal spring loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) model and consists of a distributed mass on four massless legs. Each of the legs is either in ground contact, retracted for swing, or is ready for touch down with a predefined angle of attack. Different gaits, that is, periodic motions differing in interlimb coordination patterns, are generated by choosing different initial model states. Contact patterns and ground reaction forces (GRFs) evolve solely from these initial conditions. By identifying appropriate system parameters in an optimization framework, the model is able to closely match experimentally recorded vertical GRFs of walking and trotting of Warmblood horses, and of t\\xf6lting of Icelandic horses. In a detailed study, we investigated the sensitivity of the obtained solutions with respect to all states and parameters and quantified the improvement in fitting GRF by including an additional head and neck segment. Our work suggests that quadrupedal gaits are merely different dynamic modes of the same structural system and that we can interpret different gaits as different nonlinear elastic oscillations that propel an animal forward.', 20136577: StringElement('It has been proposed that the scientific literature purges itself of articles known to be fraudulent.

These morphological changes of haploid cells were associated with changes in intracellular distribution of actin filaments. Staining with phalloidin showed that actin filaments were almost uniformly distributed throughout the cytoplasm of the myxoamoebae. When these cells were transferred to a cyst-inducing medium, the actin structures changed into short rods or dots, after which the rods/dots disappeared in the microcysts. An incubation of the myxoamoebae in the cyst-inducing medium caused the synthesis of several proteins, among which a 66-kD protein was most prominently induced. The morphological changes and the induction of the 66-kD protein was pronounced at elevated temperatures, e.g. 40 degrees C. The 66-kD protein was not induced, however, when plasmodia of the same species were incubated at 40 degrees C. We found that the 66-kD protein was co-precipitated with polymerized actin and bound to ATP-agarose. A double staining of the disk-shaped cells with anti-66-kD protein antibody and phalloidin revealed superimposable localization of the 66-kD protein and actin filaments in the short rods or dots. Although the induction of the 66-kD protein was enhanced at high temperatures, the protein was immunologically unrelated to the common heat shock proteins, HSP70 and HSP90, those are highly conserved during evolution. These results indicate that the 66-kD protein is a novel heat shock protein which is specifically expressed during cyst formation.', 1487498: 'Studies were carried out with capillary endothelial cells cultured on fibronectin (FN)-coated dishes in order to analyze the mechanism of cell and nuclear shape control by extracellular matrix (ECM). To examine the role of the cytoskeleton in shape determination independent of changes in transmembrane osmotic pressure, membranes of adherent cells were permeabilized with saponin (25 micrograms/ml) using a buffer that maintains the functional integrity of contractile microfilaments. Real-time videomicroscopic studies revealed that addition of 250 microM ATP resulted in time-dependent retraction and rounding of permeabilized cells and nuclei in a manner similar to that observed in intact living cells following detachment using trypsin-EDTA. Computerized image analysis confirmed that permeabilized cells remained essentially rigid in the absence of ATP and that retraction was stimulated in a dose-dependent manner as the concentration of ATP was raised from 10 to 250 microM. Maximal rounding occurred by 30 min with projected cell and nuclear areas being reduced by 69 and 41%, respectively. ATP-induced rounding was also accompanied by a redistribution of microfilaments resulting in formation of a dense net of F-actin surrounding retracted nuclei. Importantly, ATP-stimulated changes in cell, cytoskeletal, and nuclear form were prevented in permeabilized cells using a synthetic myosin peptide (IRICRKG) that has been previously shown to inhibit actomyosin filament sliding in muscle.

The heterogeneity of pUb explains the inability of phosphomimetic mutants to fully mimic pUb. The pH-sensitive conformational switch is likely preserved for polyubiquitin, as single-molecule FRET data indicate that pH change leads to quaternary rearrangement of a phosphorylated K63-linked diubiquitin.

In these free-floating lattices, nF and dF retracted the gel more than SC. All cells appeared to be elongated and oriented at random. Rat cells obtained by enzymatic digestion of nerves undergoing wallerian degeneration retracted the gel at a larger extent than cells from intact nerves. Rectangular lattices restrained at each extremity acquired a paraboloid shape upon retraction by neural or dermal F reflecting the mechanical tension developed by these cells on their support. Adult SC alone produced a faint paraboloid even at high cell density while SC associated with nF developed a paraboloid similar to that obtained with nF alone. The mechanical force developed by dermal F and SC in the restrained lattice was measured by strain gauges and found much higher for F than for SC. In restrained lattices, both types of F were elongated and aligned to the long axis of the gel while SC elongated but not necessarily in a parallel fashion.

The frequency of disappearance of the MAC branch increases to about 85% in all Retzius neurons upon exposure of the embryos to culture media containing 1 mM acetylcholine (ACh) and 10 microM physostigmine during a sensitive period of axon outgrowth. This disappearance represents a retraction of the MAC branch to its point of origin, while other axon branches of the Retzius neuron remained unaffected. In later development, the retracted (medial) MAC branch was replaced by a new (lateral) branch termed LAC. The observations were made using confocal microscopy of fixed embryos stained with anti-5-HT antibody and confirmed by Lucifer yellow injection of individual Retzius neurons. The specific retraction of a single axon branch might be attributable to the local presence of extracellular matrix molecules in the ganglionic neuropil, which is contacted only by the MAC axon branch and could render this branch susceptible to growth-regulating signals. Since Retzius axon morphology in standard segments of ACh-treated embryos resembled that of reproductive segments in untreated embryos, it appears possible that ACh treatment may have simulated a process that contributes to the segmental differentiation of the Retzius neuron.', 12948150: 'Dynamic three-phase (liquid-liquid-liquid) microextraction was developed for capillary electrophoresis. Four aromatic amines as model compounds were extracted from 4-mL aqueous samples adjusted to basic condition (donor solution) through a small volume of organic solvent impregnated in a hollow fiber, which was held by the needle of a conventional syringe, and retracted into a 5-microL acidic acceptor solution inside the syringe. A renewable organic film and aqueous sample plug were formed inside the hollow fiber with the repeated movement of the syringe plunger enabled by a programmable syringe pump. This is believed to be the first reported instance of a semiautomated dynamic liquid-liquid-liquid microextraction (LLLME) procedure. Following this microextraction, the 5-microL acceptor solution was analyzed by capillary zone electrophoresis (CE). This new technique provided approximately 140-fold enrichment in 20 min. Utilizing 4-chloroaniline as internal standard, dynamic LLLME could provide good reproducibility (<4.0%). In addition, this method allowed the direct transfer of extracted analytes to a CE system for analysis.', 1770167: 'Androgens influence the postnatal development of motoneurons in the spinal nucleus of the bulbocavernosus (SNB) by regulating neuromuscular synapse elimination, the process through which multiple axonal inputs are retracted from each muscle fiber until single innervation is established. In the rat levator ani (LA), one of the target muscles for SNB motoneurons, much of this loss of multiple innervation can be prevented by prepubertal androgen treatment. We used steroid autoradiography to measure the ontogeny of steroid accumulation in the SNB and the retrodorsolateral nucleus (RDLN), two motoneuronal groups thought to differ in their sensitivity to androgens. Spinal cord tissue was analyzed from castrated male rats at 7, 14, 21, and 60 days of age after injection of radiolabelled testosterone. SNB and RDLN motoneurons differ in the ontogeny of androgen accumulation. Over 80% of SNB motoneurons develop the capacity to accumulate androgen during the second week after birth, during the period when androgen regulates synapse elimination in the LA. In contrast, androgen accumulation in RDLN motoneurons develops much later (after 21 days). These data suggest that androgen may act directly on SNB motoneurons to influence synapse elimination.', 14530193: StringElement('The edge-to-edge technique is an accepted method for the surgical repair of a regurgitant mitral valve.

In our laboratory, we have observed the production of fibrillar elastin in the extracellular matrix (ECM), which makes the UBW a particularly attractive tissue to investigate smooth muscle tissue remodeling. In the present study, we explored the mechanical role that de novo elastin fibers play in altering UBW ECM mechanical behavior using a structural constitutive modeling approach. The mechanical behavior of the collagen fiber component of the UBW ECM was determined from the biaxial stress-stretch response of normal UBW ECM, based on bimodal fiber recruitment that was motivated by the UBW's unique collagen fiber structure. The resulting fiber ensemble model was then combined with an experimentally derived fiber angular distribution to predict the biaxial mechanical behavior of normal and the elastin-rich UBW ECM to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of elastin production. Results indicated that UBW ECM exhibited a distinct structure with highly coiled collagen fiber bundles and visible elastic fibers in the pathological situation. Elastin-rich UBW ECM had a distinct mechanical behavior with higher compliance, attributable to the indirect effect of elastin fibers contracting the collagen fiber network, resulting in a retracted unloaded reference state of the tissue. In conclusion, our results suggest that the urinary bladder responds to prolonged periods of high strain by increasing its effective compliance through the interaction between collagen and de novo synthesized elastic fibers.\", 19694284: 'Traditional non-rigid registration algorithms are incapable of accurately registering intra-operative with pre-operative images whenever tissue has been resected or retracted. In this work we present methods for detecting and handling retraction and resection. The registration framework is based on the bijective Demons algorithm using an anisotropic diffusion smoother. Retraction is detected at areas of the deformation field with high internal strain and the estimated retraction boundary is integrated as a diffusion boundary in the smoother to allow discontinuities to develop across the resection boundary. Resection is detected by a level set method evolving in the space where image intensities disagree. The estimated resection is integrated into the smoother as a diffusion sink to restrict image forces originating inside the resection from being diffused to surrounding areas. In addition, the deformation field is continuous across the diffusion sink boundary which allow us to move the boundary of the diffusion sink without changing values in the deformation field (no interpolation or extrapolation is needed). We present preliminary results on both synthetic and clinical data which clearly shows the added value of explicitly modeling these processes in a registration framework.', 1886928: 'Prior to reconstruction, emission data from a multi-ring PET camera must be corrected (normalized) for variations in detector sensitivity. The appropriate correction coefficients are obtained by measuring the response of all coincidence lines to a calibrated source of activity (a blank scan). State-of-the-art cameras may contain up to a million such lines of response (LORs), and therefore around 400 million counts will be required to calibrate each LOR to a statistical accuracy of 5%. Alternatively, by modelling the LOR sensitivity as the product of the individual detector efficiencies and a geometrical factor, a calibration procedure has been proposed which requires the determination of only 6000 parameters from this same data set. A significant improvement in the statistical accuracy of the coefficients can therefore be expected. Recently, multi-ring scanners have been operated with the septa retracted, increasing the number of measured LORs by a factor of eight. The acquisition of the calibration data necessary to achieve adequate statistical accuracy then becomes prohibitive. We show that, by modelling the LOR sensitivity, it is possible, with certain approximations, to normalize a septa-retracted emission data set with good accuracy. The input to the model is a high statistics blank scan acquired with the septa extended, which offers a number of practical advantages.', 7494361: StringElement('Presumed differences in the thrombolytic activity and fibrinolytic specificity of the three commonly used thrombolytic agents, streptokinase, urokinase, and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), are based on clinical study results, where variability renders meaningful comparisons difficult.

To determine cellular backgrounds of this preference, we generated an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)-expressing rat adenocarcinoma cell line (CC531s) that forms metastases in rat liver after administration to the portal vein. Intravital videomicroscopy (IVVM) was used to visualize early events in the development of tumors in livers of live animals from the time of injection of the cancer cells up to 4 days afterward. Based on information obtained with IVVM, tissue areas were selected for further analysis using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), electron microscopy (EM), and electron tomography. It was shown that initial arrest of colon cancer cells in sinusoids of the liver was due to size restriction. Adhesion of cancer cells to endothelial cells was never found. Instead, endothelial cells retracted rapidly and interactions were observed only between cancer cells and hepatocytes. Tumors developed exclusively intravascularly during the first 4 days.

The Orthosystem may replace compliance dependent extraoral anchoring aids for orthodontics and makes a bonding of well aligned mandibular dentition and it's use with class II elastics unnecessary. The fixture is designed for a one-stage application. It consists of an implant of pure titanium with a surface-treated, screw-shaped endosseous part of 3.3 mm diameter and lengths of 4 and 6 mm. Above the polished transmucosal neck follows as abutment where transpalatal arches made of rigid orthodontic wires (0.032 x 0.032 inch) are fixed by means of a clamp-cap. 6 patients with an angle class II malocclusion were implanted with the 6 mm fixture in the proximal midsagittal region of the palate during a pilot study. The treatment goal was extraction of the first maxillary premolars with subsequent retraction of the frontal dentition under maximal anchorage of the lateral teeth. For the implantation a simple surgical procedure of 10 min length was required while no further invasive action are needed until explantation. This way the strain on the patients was reduced to a minimum. They are now at varying stages of active treatment and the most advanced case is demonstrated here. The clinical and radiological findings after 12 months of treatment comprising 3 months of healing revealed no implant mobility or dislocation, favourable periimplant soft tissue conditions, and no marked mesial movement of the implant supported teeth. The frontal dentition was retracted by 8 mm with space closure occurring in a relatively short treatment period.\", 27978463: u\"As the most superficial organ, the skin is the most accessible sensory system interfacing one's body and environment. With changes in posture, it is possible that the skin may undergo large deformations resulting in changes in its structural properties. The purpose of the current work was to determine the influence of spine posture on measures of trunk dorsum skin deformation, thickness and hardness in vivo. 28 young and healthy individuals were assessed while holding three static, supported spine postures (prone neutral, spine extension, and spine flexion). Skin stretch deformation was measured across each posture using an 11\\xd79 dot matrix of 3D kinematic markers affixed to the skin of the back. Skin thickness (epidermis + dermis) was quantified using ultrasound images obtained from specific spinal levels (L4, L2, T12 and T10). Skin hardness was measured at the same specific spinal levels using a handheld Shore durometer. During the spine extension posture it was observed that the skin of the trunk dorsum relaxed/retracted on average by 12% to become both ~17% thicker and ~39% softer compared to the neutral prone posture. During the spine flexion posture the skin of the trunk dorsum stretched on average by 38% to become both ~19% thinner and ~106% harder. Additionally, in the spine flexion posture it was clear that the majority of the skin deformation occurred within the lumbar region, while deformation was more evenly distributed in the extension posture. Results also suggest that stretch distributions could be in large part determined by the intervertebral distribution of the overall spine angle, as well as in part due to the local hypodermal/subcutaneous fat and fascia distribution. With such large structural deformations of the skin of the trunk dorsum, it is suggested that corresponding changes in skin tactile sensitivity (e.g. perceptual thresholds of force necessary to elicit a sensation of touch) may be present, and should be investigated through future work. These data will aid in the development of computer models to investigate skin structural deformation (e.g. finite element models or kinematic models that track skeletal structures by accounting for soft tissue artifacts) as well as further applications pertaining to skin sensitivity, and tactile biofeedback across various body postures.\", 15502048: 'Chronic pain after thoracotomy is common, although its basis and therapy have not been well characterized. In this study we characterize the allodynic responses (mechanical and cold) as well as the histopathologic changes after thoracotomy and rib retraction in rats. The antinociceptive effect of systemic and intrathecal analgesics was also evaluated. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized and the right 4th and 5th ribs surgically exposed. The pleura was opened between the ribs and a retractor placed under both ribs and opened 8 mm. Retraction was maintained for 5, 30, or 60 min. Control animals had pleural incision only. Beginning Day 2 postsurgery, animals were tested for mechanical allodynia using calibrated von Frey filaments and cold allodynia using acetone applied to the incision site. Two weeks after surgery, animals were tested for reduction of allodynia with intraperitoneal and intrathecal injections of analgesics. Intercostal nerve histology was examined at 14 days postsurgery. Allodynia developed in 50% of the animals with 60 min retraction but in only 11% and 10% of animals when the retraction time was 5 and 30 min, respectively, and in none of the control animals. Allodynic animals showed extensive axon loss in the intercostal nerves of the retracted ribs. Allodynia appeared by Day 10 in the rib-retraction model and lasted at least 40 days. Systemic morphine sulfate (50% effective dose [ED(50)], 1.06 mg/kg) and gabapentin (ED(50), 24.2 mg/kg), as well as intrathecal morphine (ED(50), 1.19 nmol), gabapentin (ED(50), 13.8 nmol), clonidine (ED(50), 72.7 nmol), and neostigmine (ED(50), 0.54 nmol) reduced allodynia. Rib-retraction in rats for 60 min produces allodynia that lasts more than 1 mo, and this allodynia is reduced by morphine, gabapentin, clonidine, and neostigmine.

The tomographs were (a) a whole body scanner with 8 detector rings (102 cm diam) and (b) a brain scanner with 16 detector rings (76 cm diam). Each consisted of bismuth germanate block detectors. Both tomographs acquired transaxial image planes with interplane septa inserted but the unique feature of the brain devices is the ability to automatically retract septa and acquire coincidences between the two rings, thus increasing efficiency. Transaxial resolution and recovery coefficients were similar for the two devices, as expected from the equal transaxial detector widths (5.6 mm). With septa, the normalized volume sensitivity (scatter subtracted) was found to be 7% higher for the brain scanner. This reflects the combined effects of different ring diameters, numbers of coincidence lines of response, energy threshold and septa geometry. With septa retracted, the efficiency (scatter subtracted) increases by about a factor of 5. Scatter fractions measured in the reconstructed image were significantly lower than those obtained from sinograms (within the diameter of the phantom). This is indicative of the redistribution of counts in the reconstruction process since total counts are preserved.

Within 3-4 h of wounding, keratinocytes began to migrate from the edges and gradually reepithelialized the entire denuded area. Mitomycin C did not prevent the reepithelialization but did dramatically inhibit [3H]thymidine incorporation into the leading edge of cells. These results indicate that cell proliferation was not required for reepithelialization. Using a rabbit antibody against urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) and an avidin-biotin-peroxidase detection method, we localized u-PA in the keratinocytes at the leading edge of the migrating cultures. Cytochalasin B dramatically inhibited the extent of migration and also altered cell morphology; nonetheless, urokinase was detected in the limited number of cells that moved into the wounded area, even in the presence of cytochalasin B. A small but consistent enhancement (36% +/- 9) of plasminogen activator activity was observed in the supernatant of wounded cultures.

Conditions have been established for the dispersal, growth, freezing, and storage of functional human granulosa cells isolated from preovulatory follicles of women undergoing laparoscopy for gamete intrafallopian tube transfer and in vitro fertilization procedures. Optimal growth conditions for human granulosa-lutein cells were determined by plating cells at a low density and testing the capacity of a variety of culture conditions to support growth. A combination of fetal bovine serum (FBS), horse serum, and the serum substitute UltroSer G was found to increase cell number to maximal levels, 8- to 10-fold higher than with sera alone. Human granulosa-lutein cells grown under these conditions had a doubling rate of 36-40 h and were morphologically distinct from human theca interna cells grown under similar conditions. Human granulosa-lutein cells treated with forskolin retracted and rounded up, whereas cultures of human ovarian theca interna cells or human fibroblasts treated similarly did not retract. Human granulosa-lutein cells were grown for successive passages and transferred to serum-free medium containing forskolin, LH, hCG, or cholera toxin. Addition of these agents resulted in a time- and dose-dependent increase in aromatase activity and progesterone secretion. In these studies FSH treatment was found not to increase aromatase activity. In a study of the time course of 3 beta HSD activity in the absence of forskolin under serum-free conditions, it was found that 3 beta HSD activity increased 3-fold during the 72-h treatment period. Forskolin-stimulated 3 beta HSD activity also increased in a time-dependent manner, with levels in treated cells 3-fold higher than those in control cells. Northern analysis performed on total RNA obtained from forskolin- or hCG-stimulated granulosa-lutein cells confirmed that the increase in aromatase activity was associated with a corresponding increase in levels of mRNA specific for aromatase cytochrome P-450.

In vitro studies have revealed that cells allowed to stretch tend to divide and proliferate in the presence of soluble mitogens, whereas retracted cells remain quiescent. The authors hypothesize that application of micromechanical forces to wounds in vivo can promote wound healing through this cell shape-dependent, mechanical control mechanism. The authors created a computer model (finite element) of a wound and simulated VAC application. Finite element modeling is commonly used to engineer complex systems by breaking them down into simple discrete elements. In this model, the authors altered the pressure, pore diameter, and pore volume fraction to study the effects of vacuum-induced material deformations. The authors compared the morphology of deformation of this wound model with histologic sections of wounds treated with the VAC. The finite element model showed that most elements stretched by VAC application experienced deformations of 5 to 20 percent strain, which are similar to in vitro strain levels shown to promote cellular proliferation. Importantly, the deformation predicted by the model also was similar in morphology to the surface undulations observed in histologic cross-sections of the wounds. The authors hypothesize that this tissue deformation stretches individual cells, thereby promoting proliferation in the wound microenvironment. The application of micromechanical forces may be a useful method with which to stimulate wound healing through promotion of cell division, angiogenesis, and local elaboration of growth factors.

This snout widening is caused by abduction of the suspensoria, the long and flat bones outlining the lateral sides of the mouth cavity. However, it remains unknown how seahorses can generate a forceful abduction of the suspensoria. To understand how force is transmitted to the suspensoria via the hyoid and the lower jaw, we performed mathematical simulations with models based on computerized tomography scans of Hippocampus reidi. Our results show that the hinge joint between the left and right hyoid bars, as observed in H. reidi, allows for an efficient force transmission to the suspensorium from a wide range of hyoid angles, including the extremely retracted hyoid orientations observed in vivo for syngnathids. Apart from the hyoid retraction force by the sternohyoideus-hypaxial muscles, force generated in the opposite direction on the hyoid by the mandibulohyoid ligament also has an important contribution to suspensorium abduction torque. Forces on the lower jaw contribute only approximately 10% of the total suspensorium torque. In particular, when dynamical aspects of hyoid retraction are included in the model, a steep increase is shown in suspensorium abduction torque at highly retracted hyoid positions, when the linkages to the lower jaw counteract further hyoid rotation in the sagittal plane. A delayed strain in these linkages allows syngnathids to postpone suction generation until the end of cranial rotation, a fundamental difference from non-syngnathiform fishes.', 24253194: 'Cell alignment is a critical factor to govern cellular behavior and function for various tissue engineering applications ranging from cardiac to neural regeneration. In addition to physical geometry, strain is a crucial parameter to manipulate cellular alignment for functional tissue formation. In this paper, we introduce a simple approach to generate a range of gradient static strains without external mechanical control for the stimulation of cellular behavior within 3D biomimetic hydrogel microenvironments. A glass-supported microfluidic chip with a convex flexible polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane on the top was employed for loading the cells suspended in a prepolymer solution. Following UV crosslinking through a photomask with a concentric circular pattern, the cell-laden hydrogels were formed in a height gradient from the center (maximum) to the boundary (minimum). When the convex PDMS membrane retracted back to a flat surface, it applied compressive gradient forces on the cell-laden hydrogels. The concentric circular hydrogel patterns confined the direction of hydrogel elongation, and the compressive strain on the hydrogel therefore resulted in elongation stretch in the radial direction to guide cell alignment. NIH3T3 cells were cultured in the chip for 3 days with compressive strains that varied from ~65% (center) to ~15% (boundary) on hydrogels. We found that the hydrogel geometry dominated the cell alignment near the outside boundary, where cells aligned along the circular direction, and the compressive strain dominated the cell alignment near the center, where cells aligned radially. This study developed a new and simple approach to facilitate cellular alignment based on hydrogel geometry and strain stimulation for tissue engineering applications. This platform offers unique advantages and is significantly different from the existing approaches owing to the fact that gradient generation was accomplished in a miniature device without using an external mechanical source.', 17136395: 'Numerous studies demonstrate how sessile marine organisms utilize chemical, structural, and nutritional deterrents to persist in predator-rich environments. Little is known, however, about how mobile, more behaviorally complex species minimize predation by integrating avoidance and deterrence strategies. We investigated this using sabellid polychaete worms from the Caribbean and temperate western Atlantic. Sabellids extend their feather-like radioles beyond their protective tubes for feeding and respiration; the body remains inside the tube and the radioles retract when threatened. We used co-occurring consumers to determine the palatability of radioles and bodies for each of the eight species tested. In addition, we examined chemical or structural traits affecting palatability and evaluated predator escape traits, such as tube strength, speed of radiole retraction, completeness of retraction, and sensitivity to a nearby disturbance. All species had unpalatable radioles that were chemically or structurally defended, but only two species had unpalatable bodies. Thus, most species allocated defenses to tissues that were most exposed to predation. The two species with chemically defended bodies, Bispira brunnea and Bispira variegata, relied less on behavioral escapes than the other species. Their tubes were weak, they did not retract until disturbances were very close, and B. brunnea retracted slowly and incompletely even when touched. Other species generally had stronger tubes and/or retracted when disturbances were farther away. This trade-off of deterrence versus escape even occurred within a single species when populations differed in palatability. Populations of B.variegata from North Carolina and Georgia were chemically deterrent to both temperate and tropical consumers, while populations from Panama and Florida were palatable. The more palatable Panama population retracted in response to distant movement, while the unpalatable North Carolina population did not retract until nearly touched. Thus, most species utilize a combination of predator avoidance and deterrence strategies, but more deterrent populations of species utilized avoidance less.', 10550028: 'At times, there are reasons for authors to make a formal statement of retraction of work they publish in biomedical journals. This study examines 235 retracted articles and looks at the reasons for these retractions and citations to the articles subsequent to retraction. The primary reasons for retraction are error of various kinds (such as problems with method or sample, including contamination of samples) and misconduct. The 235 articles are cited a total of 2,034 times after retraction. This set of citations can be divided into two groups: citations that appear in journals included in the Abridged Index Medicus and those that appear in other journals included in MEDLINE. While most of the citations in these two groups of journals can be categorized as \"implicitly positive,\" 275 make explicitly positive mention of retracted articles. The implications for continued citation for biomedical research and clinical practice are discussed.', 29514510: \"Published articles may be retracted when their findings are no longer considered reliable due to honest error, publication misconduct, or research misconduct. This article focuses on the case of a single serial violator of research and publication ethics in anesthesiology and critical care, which is widely publicized. A chain of events led to detection of misconduct that had substantial impact on the evidence base for the safety of hydroxyethyl starch, an intravenous artificial colloid solution, which is reflected in current guidelines on fluid management and volume resuscitation. As citations to retracted works continue to be a cause for concern, this article reviews the retraction status of this author's published articles to determine whether sufficient action has been taken to retract his body of work. Results show that retraction practices are not uniform and that guidelines for retraction are still not being fully implemented, resulting in retractions of insufficient quantity and quality. As retractions continue to emerge for the author's publications, with ten more since 2011, and as they are generally increasing, these data on retractions not only provide findings of misconduct, but also allow us to make inferences about ongoing weaknesses in the system of scientific literature.\", 1467152: 'The authors describe an experimental laparoscopic sigmoid colon resection performed in the porcine model. The operation begins with the introduction of the laparoscope via an umbilical trocar. Five other trocars are then placed allowing different maneuvers. The sigmoid colon is grasped in order to gain access to its mesenteric vessels which are clipped and divided, carrying out the dissection of the entire sigmoid colon. Two modified Endo-GIA are then fired both cranially and caudally, in order to obtain a closed sigmoid specimen and to maintain patent the lumen of the descending colon and rectum. The sigmoid is removed transanally. A P-CEEA stapler is introduced via the rectum and its detached anvil is put into the lumen of the descending colon. A purse-string is applied and closed around the anvil rod. The P-CEEA is retracted, and the rectal stump closed with another Endo-GIA. After reintroducing the trocar-loaded stapler, the trocar is advanced through the suture line of the rectum and removed via a port. The stapler is then reassembled, fired and extracted through the anus. Taking into account the oncologic criteria, we think that this mini-invasive technique could be applied, after an adequate training period on the animal model, to humans also.', 8571666: 'Staphylokinase is a profibrinolytic agent that forms a 1:1 stoichiometric complex with plasminogen that, after conversion to plasmin, activates other plasminogen molecules to plasmin. The plasmin.staphylokinase complex, unlike the plasmin.streptokinase complex, is rapidly inhibited by alpha2-antiplasmin. In a plasma milieu, staphylokinase is able to dissolve fibrin clots without associated fibrinogen degradation. This fibrin-specificity of staphylokinase is the result of reduced inhibition by alpha2-antiplasmin of plasmin.staphylokinase complex bound to fibrin, recycling of staphylokinase from the plasmin.staphylokinase complex following inhibition by alpha2-antiplasmin, and prevention of the plasminogen.staphylokinase to plasmin.staphylokinase. In experimental animal models, staphylokinase appears to be equipotent to streptokinase for the dissolution of whole blood or plasma clots, but more potent for the dissolution of platelet-rich or retracted thrombi. The thrombolytic potential of recombinant staphylokinase is presently under investigation in pilot studies in patients with acute myocardial infarction or with peripheral arterial occlusion. Definition of the therapeutic benefit of recombinant staphylokinase will require more detailed dose-finding studies followed by randomized efficacy studies against other thrombolytic agents.', 26360596: UnicodeElement(u'A novel series of experiments are performed on single cells using a bespoke AFM system where the response of cells to dynamic loading at physiologically relevant frequencies is uncovered. Measured forces for the untreated cells are dramatically different to cytochalasin-D (cyto-D) treated cells, indicating that the contractile actin cytoskeleton plays a critical role in the response of cells to dynamic loading. Following a change in applied strain magnitude, while maintaining a constant applied strain rate, the compression force for contractile cells recovers to 88.9\\xb17.8% of the steady state force. In contrast, cyto-D cell compression forces recover to only 38.0\\xb16.7% of the steady state force. Additionally, untreated cells exhibit strongly negative (pulling) forces during unloading half-cycles when the probe is retracted. In comparison, negligible pulling forces are measured for cyto-D cells during probe retraction. The current study demonstrates that active contractile forces, generated by actin-myosin cross-bridge cycling, dominate the response of single cells to dynamic loading. Such active force generation is shown to be independent of applied strain magnitude. Passive forces generated by the applied deformation are shown to be of secondary importance, exhibiting a high dependence on applied strain magnitude, in contrast to the active forces in untreated cells.', attributes={u'Label': u'UNLABELLED'}), 24675098: 'This article has been retracted.', 3789599: 'An animal model for retraction pocket (primary acquired) cholesteatoma is presented.

The animals were divided into two groups of eight: the control (group C) and the DOB (group D). Diaphragmatic fatigue was induced by intermittent supramaximal electrophrenic stimulation at a frequency of 20 Hz applied for 30 min. Diaphragmatic contractility was assessed from changes in transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi). After the induction of diaphragmatic fatigue, Pdi at low-frequency (20-Hz) stimulation decreased significantly compared with the prefatigue values (P<0.05), whereas no change in Pdi was observed at high-frequency (100-Hz) stimulation. In group D, after producing fatigue, Pdi at 20-Hz stimulation increased significantly with a continuous infusion of DOB (5 and 10 \\u03bcg\\xb7kg(-1)\\xb7min(-1)) i.v. (P<0.05).

Between 2006 and 2008, subjects were enumerated and underwent otoscopic, tympanometric, and audiometric evaluations at central sites in villages. Hearing loss was diagnosed in subjects who failed a hearing screening and exhibited an average air conduction threshold value greater than or equal to 30 dBHL in the worse ear. Clinically, 32.8% of subjects exhibited a dull or retracted tympanic membrane, and 18% had abnormal tympanometry. Nearly 12% failed the hearing screening test, among whom more than half, or 6.1% overall, had hearing loss.

With additional continuous stimulation by FCS, the SMC took on a circular shape and were anchored to the substrate by retraction fibrils. This rounding was observed only when the cells were sequentially stimulated by Con A and FCS. Depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores by the addition of EGTA and Ca2+ ionophores inhibited the rounding. Transient phosphorylation of MLC20 was observed in the initial stage during the SMC rounding. The extent of monophosphorylated MLC20 increased for up to 5 min to a maximal value of 49%. The diphosphorylated form reached a maximal value of 29% within 2 min; then both forms of MLC20 decreased. The process of the SMC rounding was inhibited by antimycin A or cytochalasins, in a dose-dependent manner, findings which suggested a dependency on both metabolic energy and actin-containing microfilaments. The smooth-muscle-relaxing agent, HA1077, also inhibited the process of SMC rounding.

The news media is a major source of public understanding of genetics and a strong influence on public discourse. This paper examines the news coverage of genetics and mental illness (i.e., bipolar illness and schizophrenia) over a 25 year period, emphasizing the peak period of 1987-1994. Using a sample of 110 news stories from 5 major American newspapers and 3 news magazines, we identify the frame of \"genetic optimism\" which dominated the reporting of genetics and mental illness beginning in the mid- 1980s. The structure of the frame is comprised of 3 elements: a gene for the disorder exists; it will be found; and it will be good. New discoveries of genes were announced with great fanfare, but the most promising claims could not be replicated or were retracted in short order. Despite these disconfirmations, genetic optimism persisted in subsequent news stories. While the scientific accuracy of the gene stories is high, the genetic optimism frame distorts some of the findings, misrepresents and reifies the impact of genes on mental disorder, and leaves no space for critics or an examination of potential negative impacts. The stances of reporters, scientists and editors may all in different ways contribute to the perpetuation of genetic optimism. Genetic optimism presents an overly sanguine picture of the state of genetics; as we enter the genetic age it is important to balance the extraneous \"hype and hope\" contained in news stories of genetics and mental illness.', 23046996: u'Forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) is well known for its highly restricted expression in T regulatory cells (Tregs). A recent study suggested the existence of a Foxp3 positive macrophage subpopulation in mouse bone marrow, spleen, liver, lymph nodes, and thymus that exhibited immune regulatory effect similar to Tregs. Before this report was retracted, we attempted to study the function of this macrophage subpopulation in a mouse model of hyperlipidemia. Bone marrow and spleen cells isolated from C57BL/6 apo E(-/-) mice were stained with anti-CD11b, anti-F4/80 and anti-Foxp3 and analyzed by flow cytometry. Our results showed that 3.06-8.08% of CD11b(+)F4/80(+) macrophages from bone marrow cells and 0.24-2.21% from splenic were Foxp3-positive. Unexpectedly, unstained or isotype stained controls also showed strong autofluorescence and similar percentages of these cells fell within the same FL1 channel that counted the anti-Foxp3 stained population. Back gating of the autofluorescent population onto a SSC/FSC plot showed that this population of cells had a higher side scatter. The peritoneal macrophages (PM\\xf8) exhibited similar autofluorescence. We used qPCR to further evaluate the expression of Foxp3 mRNA in PM\\xf8 that were treated with M-CSF, M-CSF+IL-4, M-CSF+TGF\\u03b21 or in BMDM treated with TGF\\u03b21 in the presence of anti-CD3 and CD28 antibody co-stimulators. No expression of Foxp3 mRNA was detected in either cell culture systems, whereas robust Foxp3 gene expression was induced in na\\xefve CD4+ cells stimulated with TGF\\u03b21. Consistent with these findings, fluorescence microscopy showed no Foxp3 protein expression in PM\\xf8, however Foxp3 expression was easily detected in induced Tregs. We conclude that the reported expression of Foxp3 in macrophages is likely an artifact and that a stringent multimodality approach is critical to demonstrate candidate gene expression in any cell type.', 27886426: '-3, in the article with DOI: 10.1002/adma.201301243, were falsified.

The scatter fraction and noise-equivalent count rate characteristics were measured for the ECAT 951/31R PET scanner operating in septa-extended two-dimensional (2-D) and septa-retracted three-dimensional (3-D) modes. The 3-D mode is shown to provide higher signal-to-noise images than the 2-D mode at specific activities less than 30 kBq/ml. To enable increased temporal resolution in dynamic 3-D PET activation studies, a parallel version of the 3-D reconstruction algorithm was developed. Implementation of the reprojection algorithm on an 88 processor 1860 supercomputer resulted in a more than tenfold increase in reconstruction speed compared to a single 1860 processor system. An investigation of the optimal duration for imaging brain activations was undertaken in 12 normal subjects using repeated H2(15)O slow infusions and a visually presented lexical decision task. The significance of change in regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) was determined using statistical parametric maps for images acquired during stimulation, immediately after stimulation, and commencing 1 min after cessation of the stimulus. Regions of CBF change were detected in all three images. Dynamic 3-D, or four-dimensional (4-D), PET activation scanning is shown to be practical and likely to further improve the sensitivity of PET for detection of subtle regional CBF changes in functional brain mapping research.', 7553917: \"Thymosin beta 4 (T beta 4) binds to G-actin in vitro and inhibits actin polymerization. We studied the effects of increasing T beta 4 concentration within living PtK2 cells, comparing its effects on the disassembly of stress fibers and membrane-associated actin with its ability to inhibit cytokinesis and cell spreading after mitosis. We chose PtK2 cells for the study because these cells have many striking actin bundles in both stress fibers and cleavage furrows. They also have prominent concentrations of membrane-associated actin and remain flattened during mitosis. We have found that PtK2 cells contain an endogenous homologue of T beta 4 at a concentration (approximately 28 microM) sufficient to complex a third or more of the cell's unpolymerized actin. Intracellular T beta 4 concentrations were increased by three different methods: 1) microinjection of an RSV vector containing a cDNA for T beta 4; 2) transfection with the same vector; and 3) microinjection of purified T beta 4 protein. The plasmid coding for T beta 4 was microinjected into PtK2 cells together with fluorescently labeled alpha-actinin as a reporter molecule. Immediately after microinjection fluorescently labeled alpha-actinin was detected in a periodic pattern along the stress fibers just as in control cells injected solely with the reporter. However, after 13 h, cells microinjected with reporter and plasmid showed marked disassembly of the fiber bundles. PtK2 cells transfected with this RSV vector for 2-3 days showed disassembly of stress fibers as detected by rhodamine-phalloidin staining; in these cells the membrane actin was also greatly diminished or absent and the border of the cells was markedly retracted. Microinjection of pure T beta 4 protein into interphase PtK2 cells induced disassembly of the stress fibers within 10 min, while membrane actin appeared only somewhat reduced. If the PtK2 cells were mitotic, similar microinjection of pure thymosin beta 4 protein at times from early prophase to metaphase resulted in an unusual pattern of delayed cytokinesis. Furrowing occurred but at a much slower rate than in controls and the amount of actin in the cleavage furrow was greatly reduced. The cells constricted to apparent completion, but after about 30 min the furrow regressed, forming a binucleate cell, much as after treatment with cytochalasin B or D. Postcytokinesis spreading of these T beta 4-injected cells was often inhibited. These experiments suggest that an insufficient number of actin filaments prolongs the contractile phase of cytokinesis and abolishes the final sealing process.\", 16548734: \"We describe a technique to reduce the tension on the urethra while performing the urethrovesical anastomosis during a laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. A Lowsley tractor is passed through the urethral stump, and a single traction stitch is placed in the posterior bladder neck. The first anastomotic stitch is placed through the urethra and bladder neck at the 6 o'clock position but not tied. The traction stitch is then grasped with the wings of the Lowsley and retracted into the urethra, bringing the bladder neck and urethral stump into close proximity. While maintaining traction on the bladder neck, the previously placed 6 o'clock suture is tied. Before releasing the traction stitch from the Lowsley tractor and bladder neck, two additional stitches are placed at the 4 and 8 o'clock positions, completing the posterior anastomosis. Grasping the traction stitch with the Lowsley tractor relieves tension on the posterior urethra and places it on the bladder neck. This prevents urethral tears and gaps in the posterior wall. The anterior portion of the urethra and bladder neck remains open, maintaining vision. Creating a secure posterior anastomosis allows the remaining sutures to be placed under minimal tension. This technique uses an instrument readily available in the urology operating room and facilitates completion of the difficult anastomosis under minimal tension, resulting in a high-quality anastomosis with fewer gaps.\", 26809217: u'A type IV pilus filament, mainly composed of PilA, is retracted by the driving power generated by PilT and PilU ATPases. pilA is required for injection of type III ExoS effectors into epithelial cells thereby facilitating Pseudomonas aeruginosa penetration through the epithelial barrier by impairing the defense function of tight junctions. Here, we examined whether the pilT and pilU of the P.\\xa0aeruginosa PAO1 strain are required for ExoS injection into epithelial cells. We measured the quantity of ExoS injected into epithelial cells, and found that within such cells its quantity decreased by 80% (\\u0394pilA strain), 75% (\\u0394pilT strain), and 30% (\\u0394pilU strain) compared with the wild-type strain. pilT deficiency decreased the disruption of human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) cell monolayers to the same extent as that of pilA and exoS deficiency, whereas pilU deficiency decreased disruption of the monolayers less than deficiency of the other genes. pilT and pilU deficiency decreased bacterial penetration of the Caco-2\\xa0cell monolayers to the same level as pilA and exoS deficiency. Our data showed that the pilU gene expression level was reduced in the PAO1 strain after adhesion to Caco-2\\xa0cell surfaces, but the expression levels of the pilA and pilT genes did not change. We conclude that P.\\xa0aeruginosa injects ExoS into cells through the function of type IV pilus retraction, and that pilT makes a greater contribution to this process than pilU.', 7013254: 'A series of 23 primary invasive and 7 metastatic carcinomas was examined by light microscopy (LM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and immunofluorescence (IF), the latter employing an anti-actin antibody. The results were correlated with macroscopic features such as retraction and consistency. Stromal cells rich in actin, readily identified by IF in firm and retracted carcinomas, were rare or absent in neoplasms lacking these features. TEM established the myofibroblastic nature of these stromal cells. Alternate sections (LM, IF) of each neoplasm demonstrated that myofibroblasts were more numerous in \"young\" mesenchymal stroma than in densely sclerotic areas. The connective tissue adjacent to intraductal mammary carcinoma lacked myofibroblasts, suggesting that epithelial stromal invasion is required to evoke a myofibroblastic stromal response. Myofibroblasts which possess synthetic (type III collagen) and contractile properties may well contribute to the firm consistency and retraction which characterize many carcinomas. The induction of myofibroblasts might represent an important host stromal response directed toward containment of invasive and/or metastatic carcinoma. This response may be especially important in neoplasms with weak antigenicity and/or slow doubling times.', 856971: 'Techniques similar to those used in instrumenting tablet presses were applied to an automatic capsule-filling machine. The dosing unit was modified to allow the bonding of strain gauges to the compression piston. The guages formed the arms of a Wheatstone bridge circuit. Thus, compression and ejection events were monitored by measuring the bridge unbalance voltage using a suitable amplifier-recording system. The instrumented piston was calibrated in a physical testing machine. Dosing unit rotation required the interposing of a mercury contact swivel between the amplifier and instrumented piston. The instrumentation system required only one minor, permanent modification to the machine, a cut in the dosator tube. Since the same dosator piston sensed both compression and ejection, only one of the two dosing units was instrumented and the other was removed from the machine. A solenoid switching system was devised which only permitted the feeding of empty gelatin shells into the filling cycle for the instrumented piston. Representative fillers were run at constant powder bed and piston heights. Oscilloscope tracings showed two stages in slug formation: (a) \"precompression,\" representing the force sensed during dipping of the dosator into the powder before actual compression, and (b) actual piston compression. Generally, the maximum slug compression force fell to zero rapidly on retraction of the piston, but in some cases a retention force was noted, possibly due to elastric rebound of the slug against the retracted piston. A negative deflection due to binding of the piston also was observed in tracings of one material. Lubricated batches exhibited ejection forces of less than 1 kg.', 10085261: 'Behaviour of epitheliocytes and fibroblasts on special discontinuous substrata (metallic grids with square openings of 45x45 microm2) was examined in order to compare the ability of these cells to spread in two mutually perpendicular directions and to stretch over the void spaces.

Time-lapse video microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and immunofluorescence microscopy were used to examine cell reorganizations at various stages of spreading. It was found that early stages of spreading of fibroblasts and epitheliocytes were similar: the cell spread along two bars, perpendicular to each other (bar and crossbar), with the formation of a small triangular lamellar cytoplasm stretched over the opening. Later central parts of the bodies of the fibroblasts retracted from the bars so that the cells remained attached only by their polar lamellae. Successive expansions and partial retractions of these lamellae led to elongation of the cell body crossing several openings of the grid. Epitheliocytes, in contrast to fibroblasts, at the late stages of spreading did not retract their bodies and did not contract polar lamellae. As a result, their central lamellae stretched progressively over the openings. As a result of the treatment of MDCK epitheliocytes with HGF/SF the behaviour of the cells on the grids became similar to that of fibroblasts. It is suggested that these distinct spreading patterns of epitheliocytes and fibroblasts are due to the type-specific differences in the actin-myosin cortex. Experiments with microtubule-specific drugs, colcemid and taxol, indicate that the organization of this cortex is under microtubular control.', 29531022: \"PLoS One8(12): e82432 (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0082432), although in a number of cases the patient's gender is at odds between the two reports.The RNAseq data are unavailable on the European Nucleotide Archive under the reported accession number ERG003569.

However, it has severe toxic effects in both animal and man. In cultured cells, vanadate can either cause death or be growth stimulatory, depending on the cell type and growth conditions. Here, we report that in baboon aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs), vanadate induced p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity. This effect was abolished in the presence of the specific MAPK kinase (MAPKK) inhibitor PD098059. Although activation of p42/p44MAPK/MAPKK is generally thought to be necessary for proliferation, in SMCs, vanadate did not promote DNA synthesis and inhibited thymidine incorporation stimulated by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB in a dose dependent fashion (IC50: 30 microM). Prolonged exposure to vanadate exerted cytotoxic effects. Cells retracted, rounded up and detached from the substratum. These vanadate-induced morphological changes were blocked in the presence of PD098059. The addition of PDGF-BB further activated p42/p44MAPK/MAPKK in the presence of vanadate and substantially increased vanadate toxicity. We conclude from these observations that activation of the p42/p44MAPK/MAPKK signalling module contributes to the cytotoxic effects induced by vanadate.', 23051153: 'The structure and function of membrane-wall attachment sites in walled cells, and how these relate to animal focal adhesions, is an area that is poorly understood. In view of this, we investigated how membrane-wall attachments that form upon plasmolysis, respond to peptides that disrupt animal focal adhesions. The degree of cytoplasmic disruption during plasmolysis was also investigated. Upon hyperosmotic challenge, the protoplast in hyphae of the oomycete Achlya bisexualis typically retracted incompletely due to membrane-wall attachments. The inclusion, in the plasmolysing solution, of peptides containing the sequence RGD disrupted these attachments in a dose-dependent manner. In some hyphae, protoplast retraction stopped temporarily at attachment points - upon resumption of retraction, material was left that traced the outline of the static protoplast. Staining of this material with fluorescence brightener indicated the presence of cellulose, which suggests that wall deposition was able to occur despite plasmolysis. The F-actin cytoskeleton was disrupted during plasmolysis; peripheral F-actin staining was observed, but there was no distinct F-actin cap; staining was more diffuse; and there were fewer plaques compared with nonplasmolysed hyphae. Our data indicate that membrane-wall attachment points are sensitive to RGD-containing peptides and that wall deposition continues despite protoplast retraction and F-actin disruption.', 21046162: StringElement('The clinical application of natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) for sigmoidectomy is associated with several difficulties that need to be overcome before wider clinical application of the procedure.

To explore the roles of Neuro-p24, we examined the immunocytochemical localization of this protein in cultured neurons during neural induction, and performed an antisense oligonucleotide transfection using two culture models, the mouse dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and the neuro2a neuroblastoma cell line. Intense Neuro-p24 immunoreactivity was observed in the soma and small vesicles in neurites at the early stage of culture, but it gradually disappeared as cultures proceeded. Intense immunoreactivity was often observed at the growing distal end of the neurites. Morphological changes in neurites after Neuro-p24 antisense oligonucleotide transfection were examined in DRG neurons by the continual observation of a group of identical neurons. Affected cells retracted neurites transiently, followed by the re-elongation and branching of newly formed neurites. The control oligonucleotide-treated neurons appeared unaffected. When neuro2a cells were similarly treated with antisense oligonucleotides, the results were similar to those obtained in the DRG neurons. The binding of Neuro-p24 to tubulin was confirmed by both in vivo and in vitro pull-down assays. The present results support our idea that Neuro-p24 plays an essential role in neurite extension through a vesicle transport system via microtubules.', 29295508: 'Telemedicine focuses on improving the quality of health care, particularly in out-of-hospital settings. One of the most important applications is the continuous remote monitoring of vital parameters. Long-term monitoring of biopotentials requires skin-electrodes. State-of-the-art electrodes such as Ag/AgCl wet electrodes lead, especially during long-term application, to complications, e.g., skin irritations. This paper presents a low-cost, on-demand electrode approach for future long-term applications. The fully printed module comprises a polymeric substrate with electrodes on a flexible membrane, which establishes skin contact only for short time in case of measurement. The membranes that produce airtight seals for pressure chambers can be pneumatically dilated and pressed onto the skin to ensure good contact, and subsequently retracted. The dilatation depends on the pressure and membrane thickness, which has been tested up to 150 kPa. The electrodes were fabricated in screen and inkjet printing technology, and compared during exemplary electrodermal activity measurement (EDA). The results show less amplitude compared to conventional EDA electrodes but similar behavior. Because of the manufacturing process the module enables high individuality for future applications.', 7682966: 'We have investigated corticospinal (CS) axon growth around cervical spinal injury in the neonatal rat and related this growth to the astroglial reaction occurring at the lesion site. Rats received a high cervical overhemisection (left dorsal funiculotomy, right spinal hemisection) and a right cortical ablation on Postnatal Days (PNDs) 0, 3, 6, 12, and 21 to 24 (weanlings). In chronic operates the remaining CS projection from the left sensorimotor cortex was then assayed using wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase as an anterograde tracer. In other operates the formation of the astroglial scar at the spinal lesion site was studied using a monoclonal antibody to glial fibrillary acidic protein. In PNDs 0-6 operates labeled axons extend through the intact left hemicord to bypass the lesion. The labeled axons travel to the edge of the lesion, cross the midline, and pass lateral to the lesion within the dorsal and intermediate gray and dorsal lateral white matter. Axons project bilaterally to normal areas of CS termination in PND 0 operates for a distance of 2.5 to 4 spinal segments caudal to the lesion which decreases to 1.5 to 2 segments in PND 6 operates. In PND 12 and weanling operates labeled fibers do not grow around the lesion but instead are retracted rostrally. There is an astrocytic reaction to injury at all ages by 3 days postoperatively (p.o.) that becomes greater with age and p.o. survival time. A more complicated cystic scar forms in 6-day and older operates. These data show that there is an age-related change in the ability of CS axons to grow around spinal injury which ends near the time CS elongation and gliogenesis is complete in the spinal cord.', 10574746: 'Cranial kinesis was studied in two species of gekkonid lizard, Gekko gecko and Phelsuma madagascariensis, using cineradiography and electromyography. The skull of these geckoes showed the three types of kinesis described by Versluys at the beginning of this century: streptostyly, mesokinesis and metakinesis. In accordance with the later model of Frazzetta, the skull of these animals can be modelled by a quadratic crank system: when the mouth opens during feeding, the quadrate rotates forward, the palato-maxillary unit is lifted and the occipital unit swings forward. During jaw closing, the inverse movements are observed; during crushing, the system is retracted beyond its resting position. The data gathered here indicate that the coupled kinesis (streptostyly + mesokinesis) is most prominently present during the capture and crushing cycles of feeding and is largely absent during late intraoral transport, swallowing, drinking and breathing. The electromyographic data indicate a consistent pattern of muscular activation, with the jaw opener and pterygoid protractor always active during the fast opening phase, and the jaw closers active during closing and crushing. Our data generally support the model of Frazzetta. Although the data gathered here do not allow speculation on the functional significance of the kinesis, they clearly provide some key elements required for a further investigation of the functional and adaptive basis of the system.', 26151844: u'Herein, we have investigated retinal cell-death pathways in response to the retina toxin sodium iodate (NaIO3) both in vivo and in vitro. C57/BL6 mice were treated with a single intravenous injection of NaIO3 (35 mg/kg). Morphological changes in the retina post NaIO3 injection in comparison to untreated controls were assessed using electron microscopy. Cell death was determined by TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. The activation of caspases and calpain was measured using immunohistochemistry. Additionally, cytotoxicity and apoptosis in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, primary retinal cells, and the cone photoreceptor (PRC) cell line 661W were assessed in vitro after NaIO3 treatment using the ApoToxGlo\\u2122 assay. The 7-AAD/Annexin-V staining was performed and necrostatin (Nec-1) was administered to the NaIO3-treated cells to confirm the results. In vivo, degenerating RPE cells displayed a rounded shape and retracted microvilli, whereas PRCs featured apoptotic nuclei. Caspase and calpain activity was significantly upregulated in retinal sections and protein samples from NaIO3-treated animals. In vitro, NaIO3 induced necrosis in RPE cells and apoptosis in PRCs. Furthermore, Nec-1 significantly decreased NaIO3-induced RPE cell death, but had no rescue effect on treated PRCs. In summary, several different cell-death pathways are activated in retinal cells as a result of NaIO3.', 28840875: \"Objective The aim of this study was to investigate how the lips and teeth may affect the perceived aesthetics of a given smile. Lips and teeth were collectively assessed in different fields of view to see how they may contribute to smile aesthetics. The perception of 'beauty' was assessed to determine whether differences existed between; dentists, non-dentists, males and females.Methods Five subjects were photographed to produce the following views: 1) retracted anterior teeth; 2) lips at rest; 3) zoomed smile; and 4) smile showing the lower face. Images were compiled in a survey questionnaire and shown to respondents who ranked the subjects in order of aesthetic appeal. Kendall's coefficient of concordance (W) and median rank scores were used to determine the statistical significance.Results All groups demonstrated statistically significant agreement in the perception of beauty. Both the teeth and lips seemed to contribute similarly to the attractiveness of a smile. Dentists seemed to be more influenced by teeth in a zoomed smile view, however, this was negated when viewing a broader field of view. All other groups showed no difference in perception of aesthetics with changing field of view.Conclusion Both lips and teeth seem to contribute to the aesthetic appeal of a smile. Dentists may have a tendency to place a disproportionate weight to teeth when assessing a smile close up.\", 28976050: StringElement('The reliability of gingival blood flow measured by Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging is unknown.

To confirm that tension was present in adherent endothelial cells, we either cut or detached them from their basal surface by a microneedle. After cutting or detachment, the cells rapidly retracted. This retraction was prevented, however, if the CSK actin lattice was disrupted by cytochalasin D (Cyto D). These results confirmed that there was preexisting CSK tension in these cells and that the actin lattice was a primary stress-bearing component of the CSK. Second, to determine the extent to which that preexisting CSK tension could alter cell deformability, we developed a stretchable cell culture membrane system to impose a rapid mechanical distension (and presumably a rapid increase in CSK tension) on adherent endothelial cells. Altered cell deformability was quantitated as the shear stiffness measured by magnetic twisting cytometry. When membrane strain increased 2.5 or 5%, the cell stiffness increased 15 and 30%, respectively. Disruption of actin lattice with Cyto D abolished this stretch-induced increase in stiffness, demonstrating that the increased stiffness depended on the integrity of the actin CSK. Permeabilizing the cells with saponin and washing away ATP and Ca2+ did not inhibit the stretch-induced stiffening of the cell. These results suggest that the stretch-induced stiffening was primarily due to the direct mechanical changes in the forces distending the CSK but not to ATP- or Ca(2+)-dependent processes. Taken together, these results suggest preexisting CSK tension is a major determinant of cell deformability in adherent endothelial cells.', 7918523: 'Tongue position was cineradiographically analyzed during speech, before and after pharyngeal flap surgery, in 19 hypernasal cleft palate speakers with acceptable articulation and in 10 noncleft reference individuals. The results showed that the position of the tongue was significantly retracted during production of the consonants (/ti/, /ki/, and /ka/) in the cleft palate speakers with VPI compared to the reference individuals. Following pharyngeal flap surgery, the position of the tongue remained different in cleft palate speakers compared to reference individuals, although the articulation quality and resonance were evaluated to have normalized in almost all the speech samples produced by cleft palate speakers. It was suggested that the cleft palate speakers with VPI may exploit the plasticity of the speech system in order to achieve perceptually good speech, even though their tongue movements might be different from tongue movement in noncleft speakers.', 2988988: 'Morphology and distribution of cell-substrate contacts and their association with microfilament bundles in normal and RSV-transformed quail fibroblasts (16Q line) were studied by indirect immunofluorescence. The focal contacts were visualized by antibody exclusion method using monoclonal antibody to 80 kD serum protein adsorbed on the substratum. Embryo quail cells formed focal contacts of two morphological types: (1) small punctate; and (2) elongated large contacts. These two variants of contacts were designated respectively as dot and dash contacts. Both of focal contacts contained vinculin and alpha-actinin. Double immunofluorescence staining with polyclonal antibody to actin and monoclonal antibody to vinculin revealed that the dot contacts, in contrast to the dash ones, were not associated with microfilament bundles. The dot contacts were localized mostly near the active cell edges, while the dash contacts were found near the retracted cell edges and also under the central parts of the cell. We suppose that dot contacts represent initial structures which then can undergo maturation transforming them into dash contacts. RSV-transformed 16Q cells had predominantly the dot contacts which were not only located at the edges but also in the more central parts of the lamella. The dash contacts were present only in the minority of 16Q cells. RSV transformation is assumed to affect not the ability of cells to form initial dot contacts, but the maturation of dot contacts into dash contacts.', 21924804: 'In 2005 experimental work was published about the successful surgical management of fractures of the condylar head through a retroauricular approach. There were two reports in German, and later publications have not mentioned this route to open reduction and internal fixation of such fractures. The approach was studied in Germany but was poorly described and illustrated; later reports in English do not mention this route to the mandible. The aim of this study was to illustrate the retroauricular transmeatal approach, and briefly to review current surgical approaches to the mandibular skeleton and their technical variants. We exposed the mandibular skeleton by a retroauricular transmeatal route with transection of the external ear, dissection of the parotid gland, isolation of the retromandibular vein, and protection of the frontal branch of the facial nerve and the auriculotemporal nerve within the substance of the anteriorly retracted flap. Although we cannot draw any significant conclusions, the retroauricular transmeatal approach ensures extremely low risk of injury to the facial nerve, and leaves an invisible scar. The morbidity is low in terms of facial nerve lesions, vascular injuries, aesthetic deformity, auditory stenosis, salivary fistulas, sialocele and Frey syndrome. We think that further prospective clinical trials are needed better to assess and eventually develop this approach.', 9067462: \"The rarity of neoplasms in the adult mammalian retina has led us to hypothesize the presence or increased expression of 'tumor-inhibitory molecules' in the mature differentiated retina. We have begun to investigate the source(s) of these molecules, and the following study describes the inhibitory activity of a soluble microglia-derived cytotoxic factor on the proliferation of C6 cells, a glial tumor cell line. C6 cells were treated for 24, 48, or 72 h with basal medium or basal medium conditioned by retina-derived Muller cells (MCCM) or microglial cells (MGCM) and assayed for cell proliferation and/or cell death using various techniques involving fluorescent probes, lactate dehydrogenase release, or bromodeoxyuridine uptake. C6 cells increased in number from 24 to 72 h following incubation in basal medium or MCCM, but not in MGCM, where the cells rounded up and retracted their processes. The number of dead cells appeared to be the same in all groups at each time point. Similar findings were observed in the presence of 1-10% serum. About 25% of cells treated with basal medium for 72 h were positive for bromodeoxyuridine as compared with < 1% in MGCM-treated cultures. Our studies suggest that retina-derived microglial cells secrete soluble product(s) that inhibit the growth of C6 cells in culture. These molecules may provide protection for the mature retina against the invasion of tumor cells and may prove useful in the treatment of cancer.\", 12745672: 'The objective of this study was to observe and compare behavior of the collagen fiber microstructure in normal and healing ligaments, both in situ and ex vivo, in order to add insight into the structure-function relationship in normal and healing ligaments. Fifty-two ligaments from 26 male rats were investigated. Eleven animals underwent surgical transection of both medial collateral ligaments (MCLs) (22 ligaments), which were allowed to heal for a period of 2 weeks. An additional 15 animals (30 ligaments) were used as normals. Ligaments were placed into six groups: Slack (n = 6 control, n = 6 healing), Reference (n = 4 control, n = 4 healing), Loaded (n = 4 control, n = 4 healing), 15 degrees Flexion (n = 4 control, n = 4 healing), 120 degrees Flexion (n = 4 control, n = 4 healing), and Tissue Strain vs. Flexion Angle (n = 8 normals). All ligaments, except those in the Tissue Strain vs. Flexion Angle group, were prepared for scanning electron microscopy. Tissues were harvested, mounted in a load frame, and chemically fixed in one of five states: (1). slack, (2). reference (onset of loading), (3). loaded, (4). 15 degrees knee flexion, or (5). 120 degrees knee flexion. After fixation the tissues were prepared for electron microscopy (SEM). The micrographs from the slack, reference, and loaded groups show fiber straightening with loading in normal ligaments as well as in both scar and \"retracted\" regions of healing ligaments. Collagen fibers\\' diameter and crimp patterns were dramatically changed in the scar region of healing ligaments: Width decreased from 19.4 +/- 1.7 microm to 6.5 +/- 2.1 microm (p <.000001), period from 51.4 +/- 15.1 microm to 11.0 +/- 2.4 microm (p <.000001), and amplitude from 9.8 +/- 0.8 microm to 3.9 +/- 0.8 microm (p <.000001). Normal ligaments fixed in situ show wavy regions at 120 degrees but less so at 15 degrees flexion. Healing ligaments fixed in situ show regions of fiber waviness in the scar region at 120 degrees and also at 15 degrees flexion, indicating ligament laxity persists toward both extremes of the range of motion. The data suggest that straightening of crimped fibers is a functionally relevant phenomenon, not only in normal but also in healing ligaments.', 27345871: '[This retracts the article DOI: 10.5402/2011/983542.].', 12600279: StringElement('Rho family GTPase regulation of the actin cytoskeleton governs a variety of cell responses.

In the first series, a Fogarty catheter was placed in the cerebellopontine angle of 5 rabbits. When a balloon volume of 0.2 mL was produced, only the latencies of waves III-V of the ipsilateral side increased. With a volume of 0.4 mL the ipsilateral BAEPs were irreversibly lost and the contralateral one reversibly changed. A volume of 0.6 mL caused loss of the BAEP on both sides and death of the animal. In another series, the cerebellum of 10 rabbits was retracted by a self-retaining retractor laterally to medially, so an approach to the cerebellopontine angle was simulated. With a retraction of up to 36 power units (p) the ipsilateral BAEPs were reversibly changed. A retraction of 54 p caused irreversible loss of wave V on both sides. With 84 p ipsilateral and contralateral waves III-V were immediately lost. The animals died within 7 minutes. Our experimental investigation shows that not only a defined volume in the cerebellopontine angle can cause irreversible impairment of brainstem function, but also uncontrolled retraction of the cerebellum.', 21224416: 'The site-selective encoding of noncanonical amino acids (NAAs) is a powerful technique for the installation of novel chemical functional groups in proteins. This is often achieved by recoding a stop codon and requires two additional components: an evolved aminoacyl tRNA synthetase (AARS) and a cognate tRNA. Analysis of the most successful AARSs reveals common characteristics. The highest fidelity NAA systems derived from the Methanocaldococcus jannaschii tyrosyl AARS feature specific mutations to two residues reported to interact with the hydroxyl group of the substrate tyrosine. We demonstrate that the restoration of just one of these determinants for amino acid specificity results in the loss of fidelity as the evolved AARSs become noticeably promiscuous. These results offer a partial explanation of a recently retracted strategy for the synthesis of glycoproteins. Similarly, we reinvestigated a tryptophanyl AARS reported to allow the site-selective incorporation of 5-hydroxy tryptophan within mammalian cells. In multiple experiments, the enzyme displayed elements of promiscuity despite its previous characterization as a high fidelity enzyme. Given the many similarities of the TyrRSs and TrpRSs reevaluated here, our findings can be largely combined, and in doing so they reinforce the long-established central dogma regarding the molecular basis by which these enzymes contribute to the fidelity of translation. Thus, our view is that the central claims of fidelity reported in several NAA systems remain unproven and unprecedented.', 3085282: 'The relationships between cytoskeletal network organization and cellular response to cytochalasin D (CD) in a normal rat fibroblast cell line (Hmf-n) and its spontaneous transformant (tHmf-e), with markedly different cytoskeletal phenotypes, were compared (using immunofluorescence, electron microscopy, and DNAse I assay for actin content). Hmf-n have prominent, polar stress fiber (SF) arrays terminating in vinculin adhesion plaques whereas tHmf-e, which are apolar, epithelioid cells with dense plasma membrane-associated actin networks, lack SF and adhesion plaques. Hmf-n exposed to CD become markedly retracted and dendritic, SF-derived actin aggregates form large endoplasmic masses, and discrete tabular aggregates at the distal ends of retraction processes. Prolonged exposure leads to recession of process, cellular rounding, and development of large cystic vacuoles. tHmf-e cells exposed to similar doses of CD display a diagnostically different response; retraction is less drastic, cells retain broad processes containing scattered actin aggregates in discrete foci often associated with plasma membrane, large tabular aggregates are never found and processes persist throughout long exposure, vacuolation is uncommon. The CD-induced microfilamentous aggregates in Hmf-n are composed of short, kinky filament fragments forming a felt-like skein, often aggregates contain a more ordered array of roughly parallel fragments, while those of tHmf-e are very short, kinky, randomly orientated filaments imparting a distinctly granular nature to the mass. Total actin content and the amount of actin associated with detergent-resistant cytoskeletons increase following CD exposure in both cell types. Throughout exposure to CD, the actin-associated contractile proteins tropomyosin, myosin, and alpha-actinin co-localize within the actin aggregates in both cell types. Fodrin, the protein linking cortical actin to membrane, co-localizes with actin aggregates in tHmf-e cells and most, but not all, such aggregates in Hmf-n cells, consistent with their stress fiber derivation. Vinculin is lost from the tabular aggregates at the distal ends of retraction processes in Hmf-n cells concomitant with the fragmentation and contraction of SF. The aborized processes in both cells types contain strikingly similar axial cores of bundled vimentin filaments associated with passively compressed microtubules. The characteristic CD-induced distribution of actin filament aggregates and redistribution of vimentin in these cell types also occur when cells are allowed to respread from the rounded state in the presence of CD.', 28341221: StringElement('A review of interventions addressing obesity disparities could reveal gaps in the literature and provide guidance on future research, particularly for populations with a high prevalence of obesity and obesity-related cardiometabolic risk.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'BACKGROUND', u'Label': u'CONTEXT'}), 12119019: 'Human multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transport superfamily which also includes human multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) gene product P-glycoprotein (Pgp). Overexpression of MRP1 or Pgp causes multidrug resistance in cancer cells. Different from Pgp, MRP1 contains an extra membrane-spanning domain (MSD1) with a putative extracellular amino terminus in addition to the core structure of two MSDs and two NBDs (nucleotide-binding domains). The structural and functional significance of the additional MSD1 in MRP1 remains elusive. In this study, we generated an IgG1 subclass monoclonal antibody, IU2H10, specific to the amino terminus of human MRP1 and mapped its epitope to 10 amino acids (S8ADGSDPLWD17). It can be used for Western blot, immunoprecipitation, and indirect immunofluorescence studies of human MRP1. However, surprisingly we found that IU2H10 cannot react with MRP1 unless cells are permeabilized. Furthermore, the IU2H10 epitope is exposed extracellularly when the carboxyl-terminal core domain of human MRP1 is deleted. Examination of the amino-terminal sequence of human MRP1 suggests that it consist of mainly coiled structures. These observations provide evidence for a model that is different from the prevailing extracellular location of the amino terminus of human MRP1. It is possible that part of the amino terminus of human MRP1, following exposure to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, is retracted to the cytoplasm.', 31726: 'A series of 141 prepubertal boys with undescended testes operated on in a provincial teaching hospital has been analyzed five years after operation. The main features noted at presentation were the mature age of the patients and the small number of boys referred by pediatricians. The incidence of unsatisfactory results was 36% in unilateral and 35% in bilateral operations. The majority of the patients (81%) were referred for surgery after the age of five years, commonly regarded as the most suitable time for surgical correction. Three patients required a primary orchiectomy for a small atrophic testis, while 2 patients had an orchiectomy done on a previously operated testis. The complication rate for the series was 4.5%. Testicular biopsy was not done at the time of operation, and no patients were referred for semen analysis. Eight patients underwent a second orchiopexy after the first operation failed. In 6 patients an atrophic testis developed after the second procedure. The need for more than one postoperative examination is stressed in view of the fact that an initially favorable result may not persist since the testes may be found, at a later date, to have retracted into an unsatisfactory position.

Four patients at the Miyazaki Medical College Hospital were implanted with this device between September 1994 and October 1996. Implantation of the internal component was performed under local anesthesia after confirmation of sufficient sensitivity to the ossicular vibrator in an intraoperative vibratory hearing test. All patients regained socially useful hearing with the middle ear implant without any foreign body reactions or recurrence of otitis media. None of the cases showed any elevations of bone conduction thresholds 2 to 4 years postoperatively. Natural and clear sounds without interference noise and howling due to acoustic feedback were highly satisfactory in all patients. However, the first case, who had an implant in an ear following cholesteatoma surgery using the intact canal wall technique, experienced about a 10dB deterioration of the average hearing level with the implant 2 years after implantation. Gradual deterioration appeared to be caused by the retracted tympanic membrane interfering with the mobility of the ossicular vibrator. The following three cases were implanted in ears previously operated on by radical mastoidectomy, showing stable or improving hearing results with the implant. Closure of the external canal skin at the cartilaginous portion at the time of implantation seemed appropriate to maintain a sufficient middle ear space for the ossicular vibrator to work properly.

Several members of this genus were previously found to tolerate desiccation in the vegetative state yet information was lacking on the osmotic potentials of these algae. The strains were morphologically determined as Klebsormidium crenulatum and Klebsormidium nitens. These species belong to distinct clades, as verified by phylogenetic analysis of the rbcL gene. K. crenulatum is part of to the K. crenulatum/mucosum ('F' clade) and K. nitens of the 'E2' clade. Plasmolysis occurred in K. crenulatum at 800\\xa0mM sorbitol (961\\xa0mOsmol\\xa0kg(-1), \\u03a8\\u2009=\\u2009-2.09\\xa0MPa) and in K. nitens at 600\\xa0mM sorbitol (720\\xa0mOsmol\\xa0kg(-1), \\u03a8\\u2009=\\u2009-1.67\\xa0MPa). These are extraordinarily high osmotic values (very negative osmotic potentials) compared with values reported for other green algae. In K. crenulatum, the maximum photosynthetic rate (Pmax) in the light-saturated range was 116\\xa0\\u03bcmol O(2) h(-1)\\xa0mg(-1) chl a. Incubation in 1,000\\xa0mM sorbitol decreased Pmax to 74.1% of the initial value, whereas 2,000\\xa0mM sorbitol (\\u03a8\\u2009=\\u2009-5.87\\xa0MPa) lead to an almost complete loss of oxygen production. In K. nitens, Pmax was 91\\xa0\\u03bcmol O(2) h(-1)\\xa0mg(-1) chl a under control conditions and incubation in 800\\xa0mM sorbitol did not decrease Pmax, 2,000\\xa0mM sorbitol decreased Pmax only to about 62.6% of the initial value whereas 3,000\\xa0mM sorbitol stopped oxygen evolution. This indicated a broader amplitude for photosynthesis in the examined strain of K. nitens. Control samples and samples plasmolysed for 3\\xa0h in 800\\xa0mM sorbitol (K. nitens), 1,000\\xa0mM sorbitol (K. crenulatum), or 2,000\\xa0mM sorbitol were investigated by transmission electron microscopy after chemical or high-pressure freeze fixation. In cells undergoing plasmolysis the protoplasts were retracted from the cell wall, the cytoplasm appeared dense, vacuoles were small and fragmented, and the cytoplasm was filled with ribosomes. Thin cytoplasmic strands were connected to the cell wall; 2,000\\xa0mM sorbitol increased the effect. The content of soluble carbohydrates in these two strains was investigated by HPLC, as this is one known mechanism for cells to maintain high osmotic pressure of the cytosol. Both Klebsormidium species contained diverse soluble carbohydrates, including a dominant mixed peak of unidentified oligosaccharides, and more minor amounts of raffinose, sucrose, glucose, xylose, galactose, mannose, inositol, fructose, glycerol, mannitol, and sorbitol. The total content of soluble carbohydrates was approximately 1.2% of the dry weight, indicating that this is not a major factor contributing to the high osmotic potential in these strains of Klebsormidium.\", 22152220: StringElement('Rotator cuff tendon tear is a leading cause for atrophy, fibrosis and fatty infiltration of the rotator cuff muscles.

Ring-shaped hybrid tissues were prepared by thermal gelation of a cold mixed solution of type I collagen and SMCs derived from bovine aorta. The tissues were subjected to three different modes of tensile stress. They were floated (isotonic control), stretched isometrically (static stress) and periodically stretched and recoiled by 5% above and below the resting tissue length at 60 RPM frequency (dynamic stress). After incubation for up to four wk, the tissues were investigated under a light microscope (LM) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM). Hematoxylin and eosin-stained LM samples revealed that, irrespective of static or dynamic stress loading, SMCs in stress-loaded tissues exhibited elongated bipolar spindle shape and were regularly oriented parallel to the direction of the strain, whereas those in isotonic control tissues were polygonal or spherical and had no preferential orientation. In Azan-stained samples, collagen fiber bundles in isotonic control tissues were somewhat retracted around the polygonal SMCs to form a random network. On the other hand, those in statically and dynamically stressed tissues were accumulated and prominently oriented parallel to the stretch direction. Ultrastructural investigation using a TEM showed that SMCs in control and statically stressed tissues were almost totally filled with synthetic organelles such as rough endoplasmic reticulums, free ribosomes, Golgi complexes and mitochondria, indicating that the cells remained in the synthetic phenotype. On the other hand, SMCs in dynamically stressed tissues had increased fractions of contractile apparatus, such as myofilaments, dense bodies and extracellular filamentous materials equivalent to basement membranes, that progressed with incubation time. These results indicate that periodic stretch, in concert with 3-D extracellular collagen matrices, play a significant role in the phenotypic modulation of SMCs from the synthetic to the contractile state, as well as cellular and biomolecular orientation.', 24708140: StringElement(\"Twenty to thirty percent of patients with Peyronie's disease (PD) have erectile dysfunction (ED) refractory to medical therapy and may benefit from a combined procedure addressing both conditions.\", attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'BACKGROUND', u'Label': u'INTRODUCTION'}), 24970288: u'The forces of specific muscle groups have been well described for nearly all parts of the human body. Interestingly, data for the tongue and its forces are rare. In light of ongoing development of systems for managing the tongue (retaining, advancing, suspending or stabilizing), especially in patients with obstructive sleep apnea, knowledge of the maximum tongue force is important for the conceptual design of those systems. The maximum tongue force in a sagittal direction was documented using a custom-built device that included a tongue clamp and a piezoelectric sensor to capture force measurements. Once positioned securely in the device, participants were asked to move the tongue in a posterior sagittal direction, with maximum force, in each of three test positions. Forty-nine healthy volunteers (29 male) were included in the study. Tongue force measurements were collected three times in three different tongue positions. Thirty-three participants had repeated measurements to investigate any potential learning effect. The maximum force of the human tongue in a posterior sagittal direction showed high inter-individual variation and ranged from 3.2 to 52.4 Newton (N; mean 14.1 \\xb1 7.5 N), when measured from a \"neutral protrusion or resting\" tongue position. The \"retracted\" and \"maximal protrusion\" testing positions yielded lower maximum tongue forces. Men (m) showed statistically significantly higher tongue forces than women (w) (m: 16.0 \\xb1 8.4 N, w: 11.0 \\xb1 4.3 N), and there was a positive correlation with BMI and a negative correlation with age. Comparing the first measurement session with the second session (per patient) showed higher mean maximum forces in the second session, but with no statistical significance. The maximum tongue force data showed substantial inter- and intra-individual variability and gender dependency. Some male individuals produced very high forces. These forces should be considered for the future conception and development of tongue management systems and the mechanical stress to which these systems may be exposed.', 21593142: 'Although the FEED database focuses on muscle activity patterns, it is equally suitable for other physiological recording and especially for synthesizing different types of information. The present contribution addresses the interaction between muscle activity and ligamentary stretch during mastication. The postorbital ligament is the thickened edge of a septum dividing the orbital contents from the temporal fossa and is continuous with the temporal fascia. As a tensile element, this fascial complex could support the zygomatic arch against the pull of the masseter muscle. An ossified postorbital bar has evolved repeatedly in mammals, enabling resistance to compression and shear in addition to tension. Although such ossification clearly reinforces the skull against muscle pull, the most accepted explanation is that it helps isolate the orbital contents from contractions of the temporalis muscle. However, it has never been demonstrated that the contraction of jaw muscles deforms the unossified ligament. We examined linear deformation of the postorbital ligament in minipigs, Sus scrofa, along with electromyography of the jaw muscles and an assessment of changes in pressure and shape in the temporalis. During chewing, the ligament elongated (average 0.9%, maximum 2.8%) in synchrony with the contraction of the elevator muscles of the jaw. Although the temporalis bulged outward and created substantial pressure against the braincase, the superficial fibers usually retracted caudally, away from the postorbital ligament. In anesthetized animals, stimulating either the temporalis or the masseter muscle in isolation usually elongated the ligament (average 0.4-0.7%). These results confirm that contraction of the masticatory muscles can potentially distort the orbital contents and further suggest that the postorbital ligament does function as a tension member resisting the pull of the masseter on the zygomatic arch.', 21099575: StringElement('The vidian nerve is a landmark for safe identification of the petrous internal carotid artery during endonasal endoscopic approaches (EEAs) to the skull base.

Atrophied, retracted, and stiff muscle-tendon units are technically challenging to manipulate and perform poorly after surgical repair. This study employs botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT-A)-mediated inhibition of presynaptic acetylcholine release to examine in vivo neural contributions to soft-tissue biomechanical properties. In vivo load-relaxation and active muscle contractile force testing protocols were performed in the rat rotator cuff model. The passive properties were assessed using linear regression analysis and Fung's quasi-linear viscoelastic (QLV) model. BoNT-A injected muscle--tendon units had a significant reduction in force of contraction (p = 0.001). When compared to saline injected controls, the BoNT-A significantly decreased parameter 'A' of the QLV model, which represents the linear elastic response (p = 0.032). The viscous properties in the BoNT-A treatment group were not significantly different from saline injected controls, as determined by comparison of QLV model parameters 'C,' '\\u03c4(1),' and '\\u03c4(2).' In conclusion, neural tone contributes significantly to muscle-tendon unit passive biomechanical properties. Pre-surgical treatment with BoNT-A may improve the rehabilitation of muscle by altering its passive elastic properties. Accordingly, pharmacological modulation of skeletal muscle stiffness with BoNT-A increases flexibility, potentially improving function. Chemical denervation with BoNT-A may also improve the manipulation of stiff and difficult to mobilize muscles during surgical procedures.\", 26387520: StringElement('To compare the frequency of discrepancies in retracted reports of clinical trials with those in adjacent unretracted reports in the same journal.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'OBJECTIVE', u'Label': u'OBJECTIVES'}), 6861889: 'The effects of a vasopressin analog (DGAVP) with minimal endocrinological activity, were assayed on acquisition and extinction of a discrete trial, food reinforced, autoshaped lever touch response.

After acquisition of the extended lever touch response, rats were reassigned to treatment groups, and again injected with saline, 5 or 10 micrograms/kg of DGAVP 1 h before each of two extinction sessions. DGAVP facilitated acquisition (5 micrograms/kg) and slowed extinction (5 and 10 micrograms/kg) of conditioned behavior, while having no effects on the other behaviors, thus demonstrating the specificity of the effect of a vasopressin-like compound on both tasks (enhanced acquisition and retarded extinction) used to study learning.', 3886149: 'During the first 15 to 20 min of metamorphosis the larval arms are retracted and resorbed into the aboral surface of the juvenile. Arms excised from metamorphosing larvae will undergo a sequence of contraction and histolysis that is identical to that occurring in intact larvae. Prior to and during metamorphosis, epidermal cells contain bundles of 5 to 7-nm microfilaments in arrays radiating apically from the base of the cells. Sparse microfilaments also occur near the plasmalemma of epidermal cells and some mesenchymal cells in larvae fixed during metamorphosis. Contraction of excised arms is reversibly inhibited by treatment with cytochalasin B, and microfilaments bind myosin sub-fragment-1. Indirect immunofluorescence of larval arms using an antibody against chicken-muscle actin and staining with the F-actin specific probe, NDB phallacidin indicate that the arms contain actin distributed in a manner consistent with ultrastructural findings. It is proposed that retraction of the larval arms during metamorphosis is produced by an actin-mediated change in shape of the epidermal cells.', 25504843: StringElement('Hill-Sachs lesions are compression fractures that result from shoulder dislocation.

It has been thought that following completion of their roles in the embryo, most of the radial glial processes disappear before or shortly after birth. Here we use R2D5, a monoclonal antibody to a soluble cytosolic protein, to demonstrate that a specific system of midsagittal radial glial cells persists in postnatal and adult brain. In the brainstem of postnatally developing and adult rabbits and cats, the R2D5-positive processes of radial glial cells were observed to be arranged in a precisely parallel array at the midsagittal seam. These radial glial processes formed a continuous palisade separating the right and left brainstem. In early postnatal animals, R2D5-positive radial processes were found to reach the pial surface and to cover the entire midsagittal seam of the brainstem. These processes embraced dendrites and somata of neurons in almost all of the midsagittal nuclei, including the raphe nuclei, suggesting that the radial glial cells may interact with the midsagittal groups of neurons. In addition, the palisade of R2D5-positive radial processes formed loose openings for crossing axonal bundles at the midline decussations of fiber tracts. In more mature brains, somata of R2D5-positive radial glial cells that had migrated ventrally were observed within the palisades, and in adult cats, most of the R2D5-positive radial processes were found to have retracted from the ventral parts of the midsagittal seam. The spatial arrangement of R2D5-positive processes suggests that they may have persistent functional roles as an interface between ventricular humoral signals and midsagittal groups of neurons in the postnatally developing brainstem and in the adult brainstem. The structure of the midline glial system suggests also that it plays a role in organizing the spatial arrangement of decussating axons during development.', 23587930: u'An aerobic strain, Rhodococcus sp. strain FK48, capable of growing on 4-nitroaniline (4-NA) as the sole source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy has been isolated from enrichment cultures originating from contaminated soil samples. During growth studies with non- induced cells of FK48 catalyzed sequential denitrification (release of NO\\u2082 substituent) and deamination (release of NH\\u2082 substituent) of 4-NA. However, none of the degradation intermediates could be identified with growth studies. During resting cell studies, 4-NA-induced cells of strain FK48 transformed 4-NA via a previously unknown pathway which involved oxidative hydroxylation leading to formation of 4-aminophenol (4-AP). Subsequent degradation involved oxidated deamination of 4-AP and formation of 1,2,4-benzenetriol (BT) as the major identified terminal aromatic intermediate. Identification of these intermediates was ascertained by HPLC, and GC-MS analyses of the culture supernatants. 4-NA-induced cells of strain FK48 showed positive activity for 1,2,4-benzenetriol dioxygenase in spectrophotometric assay. This is the first conclusive study on aerobic microbial degradation of 4-NA and elucidation of corresponding metabolic pathway.', 7859292: 'Relationships among the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), microtubules, and bead movements on the cell surface were investigated in the thin peripheral region of A6 cells, a frog kidney cell line. ER tubules were often aligned with microtubules, as shown by double-labeling with DiOC6(3) and anti-tubulin in fixed cells. In living cells stained with DiOC6(3) and observed in time lapse, there were frequent extensions, but few retractions, of ER tubules. In addition, there was a steady retrograde (towards the cell center) movement of all of the ER at approximately 0.3 microns/min. Since microtubules are often aligned with the ER, microtubules must also be moving retrogradely. By simultaneous imaging, it was found that the ER moves retrogradely at the same rate as aminated latex beads on the cell surface. This indicates that the mechanisms for ER and bead movement are closely related. Cytochalasin B stopped bead and ER movement in most of the cells, providing evidence that actin is involved in both retrograde movements. The ER retracted towards the cell center in nocodazole while both ER and microtubules retracted in taxol. Time lapse observations showed that for both drugs, the retraction of the ER is the result of retrograde movement in the absence of new ER extensions. Presumably, ER extensions do not occur in nocodazole because of the absence of microtubules, and do not occur in taxol because taxol-stabilized microtubules move retrogradely and there is no polymerization of new microtubule tracks for ER elongation.', 4084832: 'A questionnaire was mailed to all 255 psychologists, psychiatrists, pediatricians, and family counselors listed in the 1983 telephone directory.

The platelets pretreated with thrombin in the presence of 4 mM EDTA at 37 degrees C completely lost aggregability in response to any agonist, while they were still able to retract clot, though to a less extent than controls. The clot retractions by these pretreated platelets as well as control platelets were inhibited by a monoclonal anti-beta 3 (T74) that also inhibits aggregation. These results suggest that a domain in alpha IIb beta 3 integrin involved in clot retraction is not exactly the same site involved in aggregation (the fibrinogen-binding site). C32TG cells expressing integrin alpha v beta 3 but not alpha IIb beta 3 complex showed an efficient clot retraction, which was inhibited by an anti-alpha v beta 3 antibody but not by Ro-43-5054, a potent inhibitor specific to platelet alpha IIb beta 3. When cDNA of beta 3 was transfected into 293 cells which otherwise lacked beta 3 and a retractile activity, the transfectants retracted significantly fibrin gels, which was specifically inhibited by the anti-beta 3 T74.

Ablation was accomplished by using microinjections of the toxic lectin ricin. Sprouted axons were followed for up to 26 weeks postablation. Ricin exposure severely reduced axonal numbers and the peripheral electroreceptors in the region innervated by these fibers. To visualize sprouted fibers, intact lateral line afferent nerve branches were anterogradely labelled with the neuronal tract tracers horseradish peroxidase or cobalt chloride, or the monoclonal antibody Q26A3. Within the four somatotopically organized ELL segments, sprouted collaterals were first observed two weeks after ricin injection in the medial and centromedial segments, and four weeks postinjection in the centrolateral and lateral segments. Sprouting involved intrasegmental, horizontally directed axons from adjacent nerve branch terminal fields, and mixed intra- and extrasegmental, dorsally directed axons from the ELL deep fiber layer. The sprouting response was robust but variable in its timing, peaking between 6 and 12 weeks. Subsequently, the intrasegmental, horizontally directed fibers were retained but the mixed dorsally directed fibers, including all extrasegmental axons, were retracted. Therefore, this sprouting response appears to consist of a collateral overproduction followed by a selective axonal retraction. In our view, the most likely explanation for this axonal retraction is that the descending inputs from the isthmus and the cerebellum, as well as commissural fibers from the contralateral ELL, maintain established somatotopic relationships by eliminating somatotopically mismatched sprouted collaterals.', 3884136: 'The combination of radiation therapy (RT) and conservation surgery is appropriate treatment for Stage I and II breast cancer patients, and is equivalent to radical mastectomy in overall survival and recurrence free survival. Moreover, RT and conservation surgery has the advantage over radical surgery of breast preservation (and subsequent psychological advantage).

Current studies indicate that there is an increase in complications and less satisfactory cosmetic effect on patients receiving chemotherapy in conjunction with conservation surgery and RT, but no effect on survival.

Small bundles consisting of a few fibres from freshly prepared dog papillary muscle were quickly frozen and broken under liquid nitrogen to fracture sarcomeres in planes perpendicular to the filament axes. Breaks occurred at each of several regions along the sarcomeres. The still-frozen specimens were thawed during fixation to allow elastic filaments to retract. The broken muscle segments were then treated with monoclonal titin antibody 9D10 which labelled a unique epitope in the I-band. In sarcomeres broken at the A-I junction, the titin filaments reacted toward the Z-line, independently of the thin filaments. The retracted epitopes did not reach the Z-line; retraction stopped at the N1-line level. In sarcomeres broken near the Z-line, the titin filaments retracted in the opposite direction, to the tip of the thick filaments. When the break occurred in the A-band, by contrast, the titin-epitope position was unaffected. On the basis of these results, and despite the reported interaction of titin and actin in vitro, it appears that cardiac titin molecules form elastic filaments that are functionally independent of the thin filaments. Near the Z-line, however, the titin filaments seem to associate firmly with the thin filaments.\", 16364653: 'The transmembrane form of agrin (TM-agrin) is primarily expressed in the CNS, particularly on neurites.

The animals were divided into two groups: the control group (Group C,n=8) and the amrinone group (Group A,n=8). Diaphragmatic fatigue was induced by intermittent supramaximal bilateral electrophrenic stimulation at a frequency of 20 Hz applied for 30 min. The contractility of the diaphragm was assessed from changes in transdiaphragmatic pressure (P di). After inducing fatigue,P di at low-frequency (20 Hz) stimulation decreased significantly compared with the pre-fatigue values (P<0.05), whereas no change was observed at high-frequency (100 Hz) stimulation. In Group A, after producing fatigue,P di at 20 Hz stimulation increased significantly with a bolus injection (0.75 mg\\xb7kg(-1)) followed by continuous infusion of amrinone (2.5, 5 and then 10\\u03bcg\\xb7kg(-1)min(-1)) IV (P<0.05).P di at 100 Hz stimulation increased significantly with an administration of amrinone (10\\u03bcg\\xb7kg(-1)min(-1) IV (P<0.05). There was a significant positive correlation betweenP di at both stimuli and amrinone dose (P<0.01). In Group, C, the speed of recovery ofP di at 20 Hz stimulation was relatively slower. The integrated electric activity of the diaphragam (E di) in each group did not change at any frequency of stimulation throughout the experiment.

Interactions between these two cytoskeletal systems are particularly apparent in neuronal growth cones. The juvenile isoform of the neuronal microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2c) is present in growth cones, where we hypothesize it mediates interactions between microfilaments and microtubules. To approach this problem in vivo, we used the human melanoma cell, M2, which lacks actin-binding protein-280 (ABP-280) and forms membrane blebs, which are not seen in wild-type or ABP-transfected cells. The microinjection of tau or mature MAP2 rescued the blebbing phenotype; MAP2c not only caused cessation of blebbing but also induced the formation of two distinct cellular structures. These were actin-rich lamellae, which often included membrane ruffles, and microtubule-bearing processes. The lamellae collapsed after treatment with cytochalasin D, and the processes retracted after treatment with colchicine. MAP2c was immunocytochemically visualized in zones of the cell that were devoid of tubulin, such as regions within the lamellae and in association with membrane ruffles. In vitro rheometry confirmed that MAP2c is an efficient actin gelation protein capable of organizing actin filaments into an isotropic array at very low concentrations; tau and mature MAP2 do not share this rheologic property. These results suggest that MAP2c engages in functionally specific interactions not only with microtubules but also with microfilaments.', 29273256: StringElement('To determine if preoperative imaging findings of massive rotator cuff (RC) tears were associated with (1) incomplete arthroscopic repair and (2) the use of advanced mobilization techniques (interval slides) and/or the use of a load-sharing rip stop repair construct.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'OBJECTIVE', u'Label': u'PURPOSE'}), 22840489: u\"Studies implicate the cervical facet joint and its capsule as a primary anatomical site of injury during whiplash exposures to the neck. Although the facet joint is known to undergo stretch as the superior vertebra is retracted relative to the inferior vertebra during the whiplash kinematic, the response of the facet capsular ligament and its microstructure during failure in joint retraction is unknown. Polarized light imaging and vector correlation analysis were used to measure the collagen fiber alignment in the human capsular ligament, together with traditional mechanical metrics, during joint retraction sufficient to induce ligament failure. Anomalous fiber realignment occurs at 2.95\\xb11.66mm of displacement, which is not different from the displacement when the ligament first yields (2.77\\xb11.55mm), but is significantly lower (p=0.016) than the displacement at tissue failure (5.40\\xb11.65mm). The maximum principal strain at the first detection of anomalous fiber realignment (0.66\\xb10.39) also is significantly lower (p=0.046) than the strain at failure (1.39\\xb10.64), but is not different from the strains at yield or partial failure. The onset of collagen fiber realignment determined in this study corresponds to the ligament's yielding and supports assertions that the facet capsule can undergo tissue injury during joint retraction.

Her sputum has been smear positive for acid-fast bacilli for 3 years before admission in spite of continuous antituberculous chemotherapy, and were resistant to isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RFP). She was treated with a regimen containing ethambutol (EB), prothionamide (TH) and enviomycin (EVM) but continued to be culture positive. Though she was treated with various regimens which include one to three sensitive drugs, her sputum continued to be positive for M. tuberculosis in the following 14 years. During the course, resistance to EB, TH, cycloserine (CS) and streptomycin (SM) emerged. Resistance to RFP temporarily retracted in 1988, but her sputum was bacilli negative only for 2 months after the addition of RFP to previous regimen, and followed by resurgence of RFP resistance. In 1992, data of drug sensitivity tests showed sensitivity to TH, CS and RFP in turn, which were not used for 3 to 5 years. In 1993, she was treated with RFP, TH and EVM successfully and continued to be bacteriologically negative for 7 years so far. Drug resistance to M. tuberculosis is induced by inappropriate chemotherapy as seen in this case. Regimens with less than three drugs without RFP and INH was not only insufficient to get cure but, what was worse, also induced additional resistance to used drugs. The reason of successful chemotherapy in this case was spontaneous disappearance of drug resistance to RFP and TH. This case suggests that the disappearance of drug resistance is possible, when drugs are not used for more than a few years, hence the successful treatment could be expected. However it must be emphasized that the drug resistance is produced by incorrect treatment as seen in this case, and its prevention is of the prime importance.', 24054975: StringElement('The mutual influence of suprascapular neuropathy (SSN) and rotator cuff tendon tears on muscle pathology is unclear.

At light onset, dendrites of horizontal cells, which are positioned laterally at the ribbon synapse, form \"spinules,\" little processes with membrane densities. Spinules are retracted again during dark adaptation. Spinule retraction is also elicited upon glutamate application to the retina. In the present study, we address the question whether calcium/calmodulin-dependent pathways are involved in dark- and glutamate-evoked spinule retraction. Light-adapted retinas were isolated and subsequently dark adapted during incubation in media of different calcium concentrations. Spinule retraction was clearly blocked in low-calcium solutions (5 microM and 50 nM CaCl2). Incubation in medium containing cobalt chloride (2 mM) had the same effect. Both treatments blocked the glutamate-induced spinule retraction as well. These results indicate that spinule retraction is induced by a calcium influx into horizontal cells. To investigate whether calmodulin, the primary calcium receptor in eukaryotic cells, is present at the site of spinule formation, light- and dark-adapted retinas, embedded in LR White resin, were labelled with an antibody against calmodulin and gold-conjugated secondary antibodies. Horizontal cell dendrites at the ribbon synapse revealed strong calmodulin immunoreactivity, which was more than twice as high in light- as in dark-adapted retinas. The incubation of isolated retinas with the calmodulin antagonists W5 and W13 inhibited spinule retraction. In summary, these results suggest that spinule retraction may be regulated by calcium influx into horizontal cells and subsequent calcium/calmodulin-dependent pathways.', 25398499: StringElement('The association of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion (I/D) gene polymorphism with type-2 diabetic nephropathy (T2DN) susceptibility and the risk of type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) developing into T2DN in Caucasian populations is still controversial.

In this case report we encountered an unusual initial presentation of this disease.Methods: Case presentation.Results: An 18-year-old female presented for the first time to her gynecologist with complaint of difficulty with complete emptying of bladder and dribbling. She had noted the onset of these symptoms two months prior to presentation. She denied any long-term history of vulvar itching or irritation. Her menses were normal with no complaints of dysmenorrhea. Onset of menarche and pubertal development were also normal. She denied any pre-pubertal history of labial adhesions or lichen sclerosis. The patient was not sexually active. She was diagnosed with labial adhesions and her first course of treatment included topical estrogen therapy for 8 weeks. Her second course of therapy included topical testosterone for 6 weeks without any improvement or side effects. On evaluation at our institution the posterior aspect of the labia minora could not be seen and the area of the vaginal introitus was completely obstructed (see picture). The clitoral hood could not be retracted and the surrounding vulva appeared atrophic and white. The degree of obstruction was such that the urethra could not be seen. In the operating room the labia minora were manually separated. The patient applied clobetasol.05% ointment for the next two weeks to the vulva and then switched to a less potent steroid.

Indeed, Cdc42 is involved in actin polymerization and filopodia formation, whereas RhoA induces GC collapse and neurite retraction through actomyosin contraction. In this study we employed F\\xf6rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) microscopy to study the spatio-temporal dynamics of Cdc42 and RhoA in GCs in response to local Semaphorin-3A (Sema3A) stimulation obtained with lipid vesicles filled with Sema3A and positioned near the selected GC using optical tweezers. We found that Cdc42 and RhoA were activated at the leading edge of NG108-15 neuroblastoma cells during spontaneous cycles of protrusion and retraction, respectively. The release of Sema3A brought to a progressive activation of RhoA within 30 s from the stimulus in the central region of the GC that collapsed and retracted. In contrast, the same stimulation evoked waves of Cdc42 activation propagating away from the stimulated region. A more localized stimulation obtained with Sema3A coated beads placed on the GC, led to Cdc42 active waves that propagated in a retrograde manner with a mean period of 70 s, and followed by GC retraction. Therefore, Sema3A activates both Cdc42 and RhoA with a complex and different spatial-temporal dynamics.', 25367795: \"Retraction Note to: J Zhejiang Univ-Sci B (Biomed & Biotechnol) 2013 Mar.; 14(3):216-223.

The wire has a temperature sensor in the distal tip with a sensitivity of 0.03 degrees Celcius. In 13 patients presenting with either acute or chronic coronary syndromes as indications for percutaneous coronary intervention, the following parameters were assessed: thermography, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), angiography and serum markers for inflammation (C-reactive protein) and ischemia (troponin).

Treatment with recombinant human TNF-alpha (rhTNF) for 24 to 72 hr produces (i) process retraction in some but not all OLGs, (ii) a reduction in the resting membrane potential with no significant change in membrane capacitance or input resistance over control cells and (iii) a decrease in the expression of both the inwardly rectifying and outward K+ current. The magnitude of the membrane potential change as well as K+ current inhibition was larger in cells with retracted processes. The electrophysiological effects of rhTNF were attenuated when rhTNF was neutralized with a polyclonal anti-rhTNF antibody. The binding of rhTNF to its receptor has been reported to increase GTP binding, to increase GTPase activity of a pertussis-sensitive G protein, and to produce an elevation in intracellular cAMP in other cell types. However, pretreatment of OLGs with activated pertussis toxin failed to attenuate or mimic the effects of rhTNF. Chronic exposure of OLGs to the membrane permeant analogue of cAMP, 8-bromo-cAMP, resulted primarily in an inhibition of the inwardly rectifying K+ current, an effect which was less than that produced by rhTNF alone and without any of the associated rhTNF-induced morphological changes. This indicates that the effects of rhTNF cannot be entirely accounted for by an elevation in intracellular cAMP. Cycloheximide (CHX), an inhibitor of protein synthesis, mimicked the effects of rhTNF; however, the effects of rhTNF and CHX were not additive. The finding that both ionic current expression and membrane potential were reduced in cells treated with rhTNF that appeared morphologically normal suggests that abnormal ion channel expression in OLGs precedes and may contribute to eventual myelin swelling and damage.', 29259084: 'There is a growing realization that graduate education in the biomedical sciences is successful at teaching students how to conduct research but falls short in preparing them for a diverse job market, communicating with the public, and remaining versatile scientists throughout their careers.

Oral gavage of Gug significantly retarded the growth of PC-3 xenografts in athymic mice without causing weight loss and any other side effects.

This poor utilization of the available photons could be improved by increasing the intrinsic efficiency of the detection process and, more significantly, by increasing the solid angle coverage of the tomography. While multi-ring scanners currently have an axial length of about 10 cm, the useful solid angle is limited by the presence of interplane septa. These septa reduce the acceptance rate not only of scattered photons but also of true unscattered coincidences, although in studies performed at high photon counting rates the loss of potential signal may be less important than a reduction in scatter. Removal of the septa increases the absolute sensitivity of the scanner to about 3%, a figure which also includes an unavoidable increase in scattered photons. However, in studies performed at low photon counting rates, any increase in scattered and random (uncorrelated) coincidences resulting from septa removal may be an acceptable price to pay for the accompanying increase in signal, provided that there is a real improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio. Recently, scanners with automatically retractable septa have become commercially available, thus enabling the configuration (i.e. septa extended or retracted) to be selected according to the study to be performed.', 20856155: StringElement('The goal of this work was to assess electrophysiologic response changes to acoustic stimuli as an intracochlear electrode impacted cochlear structures in an animal model of hearing preservation cochlear implantation.

Disentangling these two sources of variability has challenged ecologists working in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Using a novel spatially explicit statistical model, we tested for the presence of density-independent and density-dependent habitat selection in yellowfin sole (Limanda aspera) in the eastern Bering Sea. We found specificities in the density-dependent processes operating across ontogeny and particularly with gender. Density-dependent habitat expansion occurred primarily in females, and to a lesser degree in males. These patterns were especially evident in adult stages, while juvenile stages of both sexes exhibited a mix of different dynamics. Association of yellowfin sole with substrate type also varied by sex and to a lesser degree with size, with large females distributed over a wider range of substrates than males. Moreover, yellowfin sole expanded northward as cold subsurface waters retracted in summer, suggesting high sensitivity to arctic warming. Our findings illustrate how marginal habitats can play an important role in buffering density-dependent habitat expansion, with direct implications for resource management. Our spatially explicit modeling approach is effective in evaluating density-dependent spatial dynamics, and can easily be used to test similar hypotheses from a variety of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.', 10993010: 'Traditional contraindications to beta-blockers are peripheral vascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. Recent data seem to show that rigorous application of these rules are not completely justified and indicate that many patients would be inappropriately excluded from the beneficial effects of this therapy. Appraisal of clear guidelines for a safe use of beta-blockers is thus mandatory for the clinician. A brief review of the effects of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade is offered. The therapy is aimed at blocking beta 1-receptors. On the other hand, the block of beta 2-receptors causes the well known side effects, i.e. vasoconstriction, delayed response to hypoglycemia in diabetic patients, bronchoconstriction. From the first compound, propranolol, with uniform action on beta 1 and beta 2-receptors, further generation of beta-blockers were subsequently developed: beta 1-selective, with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and with associated vasodilating \"ancillary\" property. Some favorable reduction in collateral effects has thus been obtained with new compounds, without reaching complete safety. Examination of exclusion criteria applied in clinical trials offers no useful indications because of their imprecise definition. Examination of the literature and a more accurate understanding of the diseases, traditionally considered contraindications, may help setting up a uniform and clear path: peripheral vascular disease: beta-blockers should be avoided only in those patients with vasospastic disorders, rest pain with severe peripheral vascular disease or nonhealing lesions. In patients with mild to moderate disease, beta-blockers can be prescribed, but careful surveillance for any changes in symptoms related to intermittent claudicatio should be achieved; diabetes mellitus: previous apprehension for the lessening reaction to hypoglycemia in patients treated with insulin has been retracted. Beta-blockers are not contraindicated in these patients. Some caution should be addressed when signs of autonomic disease are present or in patients with difficult glycemic control. Patients on oral long-acting antidiabetic drugs should not be neglected. The risk of prolonged and paucisymptomatic hypoglycemia while taking beta-blocker agents is somewhat more relevant than in patients treated regularly with insulin; COPD and asthma: confusion may arise if rigorous definition of these diseases and their severity is not applied following the guidelines of the American Thoracic Society. Because bronchial hyperreactivity seems the crucial factor in determining collateral effects to beta-blocker agents, agreement can be reached on the following statements. Beta-blockers are contraindicated a) when history of asthma is present, b) when COPD is moderate to severe, i.e. with FEV1 reduction < 50% of the predicted value, c) in patients on chronic bronchodilator treatment, d) in chronic airflow limitation with evidence of > or = 20% reversibility in airway obstruction in response to inhaled salbutamol.

That test determines the experimentwise alpha error as well as location and extent of focal activations in each individual. Its performance was assessed in five normal volunteers, using (15)O-H2O-PET data acquired on a high-resolution scanner, with septa retracted (3D mode), during functional activation by repeating words versus resting (four replications each). Calculated alpha errors decreased and the size of activated tissue volumes (voxels with P < or = 0.05) increased with increasing filter kernel size applied to the difference images. At a filter kernel of 12 mm Gaussian full width at half maximum, significant focal activations were seen bilaterally in superior temporal cortex, including Brodmann's areas 41 and 42, in all five subjects. Additional foci were detected in the precentral gyrus, left inferior frontal gyrus, supplementary motor area, and cerebellum of several subjects. The average CBF increase in activated voxels ranged from 17.6% to 28.7%. Activated volumes were smaller than those detected with a standard parametric test procedure. We conclude that the permutation test is a less sensitive procedure, having the advantage of not depending on unproven distributional assumptions, that detects strong activation foci in individual subjects with high reproducibility.\", 27751806: 'This article has been retracted: please see Elsevier Policy on Article Withdrawal (https://www.elsevier.com/about/our-business/policies/article-withdrawal).

A less invasive alternative to open heart surgery is transapical or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), already emerging as a feasible treatment for patients with high surgical risk. The bioprosthetic valves are delivered via catheters using transarterial or transapical approaches and are implanted within diseased aortic valves. This paper reports the development of a new self-expanding stent for minimally invasive aortic valve replacement and its delivery device for the transapical approach under real-time magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance. Made of nitinol, the new stent is designed to implant and embed a commercially available bioprosthetic aortic valve in aortic root. An MRI passive marker was affixed onto the stent and an MRI active marker to the delivery device. These capabilities were tested in ex vivo and in vivo experiments. Radial resistive force, chronic outward force, and the integrity of bioprosthesis on stent were measured through custom design dedicated test equipment. In vivo experimental evaluation was done using a porcine large animal model. Both ex vivo and in vivo experiment results indicate that the self-expanding stent provides adequate reinforcement of the bioprosthetic aortic valve and it is easier to implant the valve in the correct position. The orientation and positioning of the implanted valve is more precise and predictable with the help of the passive marker on stent and the active marker on delivery device. The new self-expanding nitinol stent was designed to exert a constant radial force and, therefore, a better fixation of the prosthesis in the aorta, which would result in better preservation of long-term heart function. The passive marker affixed on the stent and active marker embedded in the delivery devices helps to achieve precise orientation and positioning of the stent under MRI guidance. The design allows the stent to be retracted in the delivery device with a snaring catheter if necessary. Histopathology reports reveal that the stent is biocompatible and fully functional. All the stented bioprosthesis appeared to be properly seated in the aortic root.', 22818188: 'The discovery and de-discovery of the xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) has been a tumultuous roller-coaster ride for scientists and patients.

In reality, every paper contains misinformation; at issue is whether the balance of correct versus incorrect information is acceptable. This paper postulates that analysis of retracted research papers can provide insight into medical misinformation, although retracted papers are not a random sample of incorrect papers. Error is the most common reason for retraction and error may be the principal cause of misinformation as well. Still, one-quarter of retracted papers are fraudulent, and misinformation may also arise through fraud. This paper hypothesises that error and fraud are the main sources of misinformation and that error is more common than fraud. Retraction removes misinformation from the literature; bias is non-retracted misinformation. Bias arises when scientific impropriety results in false research findings. Impropriety can involve experimental design, data collection, data analysis, or data presentation. Yet impropriety also arises through earnest error or statistical naivet\\xe9; not all bias is fraud. Several measures are proposed to minimise misinformation in the medical literature, including: greater detail in the clinical trial registry, with rigorous definition of inclusion and exclusion criteria and primary endpoints; clear statistical criteria for every aspect of clinical trials, especially sample size; responsibility for data integrity that accrues to all named authors; increased transparency as to how the costs of research were paid; and greater clarity as to the reasons for retraction. Misinformation can arise without malicious intent; authors of incorrect papers are owed a presumption of incompetence, not malice.', 26103185: u\"We have previously developed a retrospective 4D-MRI technique using body area as the respiratory surrogate, but generally, the reconstructed 4D MR images suffer from severe or mild artifacts mainly caused by irregular motion during image acquisition. Those image artifacts may potentially affect the accuracy of tumor target delineation or the shape representation of surrounding nontarget tissues and organs. So the purpose of this study is to propose an approach employing principal component analysis (PCA), combined with a linear polynomial fitting model, to remodel the displacement vector fields (DVFs) obtained from deformable image registration (DIR), with the main goal of reducing the motion artifacts in 4D MR images. Seven patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (2/7) or liver metastases (5/7) in the liver, as well as a patient with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), were enrolled in an IRB-approved prospective study. Both CT and MR simulations were performed for each patient for treatment planning. Multiple-slice, multiple-phase, cine-MRI images were acquired in the axial plane for 4D-MRI reconstruction. Single-slice 2D cine-MR images were acquired across the center of the tumor in axial, coronal, and sagittal planes. For a 4D MR image dataset, the DVFs in three orthogonal direction (inferior\\u2013superior (SI), anterior\\u2013posterior (AP), and medial\\u2013lateral (ML)) relative to a specific reference phase were calculated using an in-house DIR algorithm. The DVFs were preprocessed in three temporal and spatial dimensions using a polynomial fitting model, with the goal of correcting the potential registration errors introduced by three-dimensional DIR. Then PCA was used to decompose each fitted DVF into a linear combination of three principal motion bases whose spanned subspaces combined with their projections had been validated to be sufficient to represent the regular respiratory motion. By wrapping the reference MR image using the remodeled DVFs, 'synthetic' MR images with reduced motion artifacts were generated at selected phase. Tumor motion trajectories derived from cine-MRI, 4D CT, original 4D MRI, and 'synthetic' 4D MRI were analyzed in the SI, AP, and ML directions, respectively. Their correlation coefficient (CC) and difference (D) in motion amplitude were calculated for comparison. Of all the patients, the means and standard deviations (SDs) of CC comparing 'synthetic' 4D MRI and cine-MRI were 0.98 \\xb1 0.01, 0.98 \\xb1 0.01, and 0.99 \\xb1 0.01 in SI, AP, and ML directions, respectively. The mean \\xb1 SD Ds were 0.59 \\xb1 0.09 mm, 0.29\\xb1 0.10 mm, and 0.15 \\xb1 0.05 mm in SI, AP and ML directions, respectively.

And its potential usefulness in reducing motion artifacts and improving image quality has been demonstrated by the preliminary results in oncological patients.\", 28040596: 'Myocardial infarction has been reported to be responsible for about 7.3 million deaths each year globally.

Beaumont and his colleagues now provide a further reanalysis of these data, showing increased mortality in particular from stomach cancer, but with serious limitations in the data and methods of analysis.

Field trials demonstrated that these types of SPME samplers are suitable for the long-term monitoring of organic pollutants in water. These samplers possess all of the advantages of SPME: they are solvent-free, sampling, extraction and concentration are combined into one step, and they can be directly injected into a gas chromatograph (GC) for analysis without further treatment. These samplers also address the additional needs of a passive sampling technique: they are economical, easy to deploy, and the TWA concentrations of target analytes can be obtained with one sampler. Moreover, the mass uptake of these samplers is independent of the face velocity, or the effect can be calibrated, which is desirable for long-term field sampling, especially when the convection conditions of the sampling environment are difficult to measure and calibrate.

Here we report a study of the genetic diversity and structure of 29 natural Mongolian oak (Quercus mongolica) populations using 19 nuclear simple sequence repeat (nSSR) loci and four chloroplast DNA fragments. Bayesian clustering analysis with nSSRs revealed five groups, which were inferred by approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to have diverged in multiple refugia through multiple glacial-interglacial cycles. Analysis of chloroplast DNA variation revealed four lineages that were largely but incompletely geographically disjunct. Ecological niche modelling (ENMs) indicated a southward range shift of the oak's distribution at the LGM, although high suitability scores were also evident in the Changbai Mts. (Northeast China), the Korean Peninsula, areas surrounding the Bohai Sea, and along the coast of the Russian Far East. In addition, endemic chloroplast DNA haplotypes and nuclear lineages occurred in high-latitude northern areas where the ENM predicted no suitable habitat. The combined evidence from nuclear and chloroplast DNA, and the results of the ENM clearly demonstrate that multiple northern refugia, including cryptic ones, were maintained across the current distributional range of the Mongolian oak during the LGM or earlier glacial periods. Though spatially limited, postglacial expansions from these refugia have led to a pattern of decreased genetic diversity with increasing latitude.\", 18071794: StringElement('Magnetic retraction has potential advantages over existing direct physical retraction means (e.g., forceps) in terms of providing complete atraumatic retraction, avoiding tumour cell exfoliation as well as offering the possibility of noncontact retraction.

The SecA protein acts as the molecular motor that drives the translocation of presecretory proteins through the membrane in a stepwise fashion concomitant with large conformational changes accompanying its own membrane insertion/retraction reaction cycle coupled to ATPase activity. The high flexibility of SecA causes a dynamic conformational heterogeneity which presents a barrier to growth of crystals of high diffraction quality. As shown by fluorescence spectroscopy, the T(m) of the endothermic transition of cytosolic SecA from Bacillus subtilis is shifted to higher temperatures in the presence of 30% glycerol, indicating stabilization of the protein in its compact membrane-retracted conformational state. High glycerol concentrations are also necessary to obtain three-dimensional crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis, suggesting that stabilization of the conformational dynamics of SecA may be required for effective crystallization.

Most of the currently available inhibitors are weak in terms of potency, drug-likeness, and furin specificity thereby necessitating the development of newer compounds especially mechanism-based inhibitors. Here, the roles of active site Cys198 (C198), His194 (H194), and Ser386 (S386) were investigated using computational-site-directed mutagenesis and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Data were obtained from six (6) biosystems: wildtype (C198/S386), furin-C198G (S386), furin-S386G (C198), and their peptide (nascent hydrolyzed peptide H2N-RTRR-CO2) bound complexes. The results strongly supported that in wildtype furin but not S386G and C198G mutants, following S386/scissile carbon attack (4.0 \\xc5), the peptide retracted from the active site, representing peptide release post hydrolysis. Furthermore, in S386G mutant, C194 side chain thiolate ion may act as the nucleophile replacement but competing electron-rich centers (H194, H364) and energetically unattainable geometric strain on the peptide may constitute the limiting factors. In biosystems not complexed with peptide (representative of pre-attack state), C198 preferentially engaged H194 imidazole moiety via sulfur-\\u03c0 bond system causing a dihedral and positional restraints on the imidazole ring for ultimate alignment of its NE2 hydrogen atom with the side chain enolate oxygen of S364 required for optimal proton transfer.

Locomotor variables of the ponies were qualitatively and, after scaling, quantitatively compared with those of horses. Ponies made shorter strides than horses, evidenced by a shorter stance and swing duration, although their relative stance durations were similar. Neither linear nor dynamic scaling procedures could completely compensate for differences in height at the withers comparing ponies and horses. The patterns of the joint angle-time curves were similar. Ponies had a larger range of pro- and retraction, with a more protracted forelimb and a more retracted hindlimb, therefore demonstrating a more extended trot. The horses trotted with more extended elbow, stifle and tarsal joints and a more flexed hip joint, which is in accordance with the conformation for the Warmblood. The ponies moved with a stiffer trot in contrast to the more supple trot of the horses, which showed a larger maximal fetlock extension during the stance phase. In conclusion, ponies and horses move qualitatively similarly at age 4 months, but characteristic breed differences in conformation and gait quality can already be detected. Scaling methods to compensate for differences in height at the withers cannot be applied when animals move at the same velocity.\", 22664646: StringElement('Separate analysis of cause-specific treatment effects is important for interpreting results of randomized trials.

These results confirm that sophocarpine played an anti-inflammatory role in LPS-induced mastitis by regulating TLR4 and the NF-\\u03baB and MAPK signaling pathways in mammary gland tissues. Therefore, sophocarpine may be a potential therapeutic drug for the treatment of mastitis.', 7476720: u'Head-scatter factors of symmetric square and rectangular fields (field center on the central beam axis) defined by the upper (Y) and lower (X) jaws for 6 and 15 MV photon beams from 2300CD and 600C accelerators (Varian Associates, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) were measured, as well as those for fields shaped by the Y jaws and the multileaf collimator (MLC) of the 2300CD. For rectangular fields, the head-scatter factor for the field (x = a and y = b) was different from that for the field (y = a and x = b). This difference was 2% -3% for fields defined by conventional collimators when [formula, see text] was large, and became 4%-5% when the MLC and YT jaws were used to shape the fields with the X jaws retracted. In order to calculate values for head-scatter factors of rectangular fields accurately using an equivalent square formalism, the side of the equivalent square should be obtained with different weights for lower and upper jaws, as proposed by Vadash and Bj\\xe4rngard [Med. Phys. 20, 733-734 (1993)]. Our measurements demonstrate that the relative weight (G) of upper and lower jaws is strongly dependent on their distances from the x-ray source, while the beam energy has little effect on the value of G. We further show that G can be calculated simply from these distances. An analytical representation for head-scatter factors of square and rectangular fields is also developed in this paper. The quality of this representation was judged by the root-mean-square (rms) deviation from measured head-scatter factors, which ranged from 0.11%-0.27%.', 28683764: StringElement('Publication retraction is a mechanism to preserve the scientific literature against publications that contain seriously flawed or erroneous data, redundant publication, plagiarism, unethical research, and other features that compromise the integrity of science.

Since one potential target of a rise in [Ca2+]i is the activation of myosin II, we characterized the role of myosin II during motility. Treatment of neutrophils with a myosin inhibitor (2,3-butanedione monoxime), or myosin light chain kinase inhibitors (ML-7, ML-9, or KT5926) resulted in impaired uropod retraction and a dose-dependent decrease in chemokinesis following stimulation with N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP). Treatment with ML-9 resulted in a redistribution of F-actin and talin to the non-retracted uropods, mimicking the redistribution observed during [Ca2+]i buffering. Impairment of uropod retraction and redistribution of F-actin and talin by myosin II inhibition was only observed on adhesive substrates such as fibronectin and not on poorly adhesive substrates such as human serum-coated glass. At higher concentrations of ML-9, cell polarization was inhibited and pseudopod extension occurred radially. Using an antibody specific for serine 19-phosphorylated regulatory light chain of myosin II, regions of activated myosin II were found at the leading edge as well as the uropod in motile fMLP-stimulated cells. [Ca2+]i depletion caused a 50% decrease in the level of serine 19-phosphorylated myosin II suggesting that activation of myosin II by intracellular Ca2+ transients may be an essential step in establishing a polarized pseudopod and providing the force required for uropod retraction during PMN motility on adhesive surfaces.', 27848190: 'The quality and authenticity of images is essential for data presentation, especially in the life sciences. Questionable images may often be a first indicator for questionable results, too. Therefore, a tool that uses mathematical methods to detect suspicious images in large image archives can be a helpful instrument to improve quality assurance in publications. As a first step towards a systematic screening tool, especially for journal editors and other staff members who are responsible for quality assurance, such as laboratory supervisors, we propose a basic classification of image manipulation. Based on this classification, we developed and explored some simple algorithms to detect copied areas in images. Using an artificial image and two examples of previously published modified images, we apply quantitative methods such as pixel-wise comparison, a nearest neighbor and a variance algorithm to detect copied-and-pasted areas or duplicated images. We show that our algorithms are able to detect some simple types of image alteration, such as copying and pasting background areas. The variance algorithm detects not only identical, but also very similar areas that differ only by brightness. Further types could, in principle, be implemented in a standardized scanning routine. We detected the copied areas in a proven case of image manipulation in Germany and showed the similarity of two images in a retracted paper from the Kato labs, which has been widely discussed on sites such as pubpeer and retraction watch.', 24624644: 'This case report describes the successful treatment of a 29-year-old young woman who had severe bimaxillary dento-alveolar protrusion, with the four premolars already extracted.

In order to visualize the morphological changes, the cells were observed with cryo-SEM. F-actin was localized using rhodamine (TRI)-phalloidin and vinculin using a primary monoclonal antibody and a second TRI-conjugated antibody. The results indicate that after the addition of 10(-7) M TPA, Sertoli cells begin to round up and their cytoplasm is retracted towards a central region. Actin bundle organization is disrupted and vinculin assumes a punctuate distribution throughout the cell. Thus, the reorganization of actin and vinculin and subsequent changes in cell morphology seem to be brought about by TPA affecting not only actin but also the protein vinculin which interacts with actin.

Congruent paired structures are seen in phase-contrast. Following heat treatment (45 degrees C, 9 min), granules are retracted about a less indented nucleus, and anti-centrosome immunofluorescence is absent or very weak, even though paired centrosomal structures remain at least as phase-dense as in controls. Immunofluorescent staining with antimicrotubule antibody is also essentially lost following heat treatment.

The patient was 15 years and 10 months of age when she reported to our university hospital with a chief complaint of anterior openbite and reversed occlusion. The patient had an anterior openbite with an overjet of -3.0 mm and overbite of -5.0 mm and a Class III molar relationship. The cephalometric analysis showed a skeletal Class III relationship (ANB 0 degrees ). After the extraction of the bilateral mandibular third molars, miniplates were placed in the mandibular external oblique line. The mandibular dentition was retracted using elastic chain and miniplates. After treatment, an Angle Class I molar relationship was achieved and overjet and overbite had become 2.0 mm and 1.5 mm. A good facial appearance and occlusal relationship were obtained. The total active orthodontic treatment period was 23 months. Wrap-around type retainers were placed on both jaws and a lingual bonded retainer was also attached in the mandibular incisors. After 1 year of retention, the occlusion was stable, and a good facial profile was also retained. The mandibular deviation to the left was improved and the strain in the circumoral musculature during lip closure disappeared. An appropriate interincisal relationship was achieved by the uprighting of mandibular dentition without changing the vertical intermaxillary relationship.

Previously both resident microglia and circulating monocytes, as well as oligodendrocytes, have all been considered to be the phagocytic cells. In these present experiments macrophages and microglia were studied using lectin histochemistry for Griffonia simplicifolia agglutinin and the monoclonal antibody ED1 at light microscopic level. Oligodendrocytes were demonstrated ultrastructurally using immunohistochemistry with monoclonal antibodies against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). Ultrastructural examination of the degeneration optic nerves confirmed longstanding reports of the slow nature of breakdown in the adult central nervous system. During the early periods of breakdown, starting at 1 week and continuing to 1 or 2 months, it was difficult to type, on ultrastructural examination alone, the nature of all the cells undergoing phagocytosis, but many of them resembled microglia/macrophages. Myelin debris cleared very slowly and could still be recognised prominently in the nerve up to 22 months post-enucleation. Lectin and immunochemical examination showed that the early major phagocytic component of phagocytosis was carried out by macrophages, probably both circulating and resident. In addition, however, myelin and axonal debris was taken up or retracted into oligodendrocyte processes, which were stained with antibodies to MOG. This oligodendrocyte component appeared to be small in relationship to the overall degree of debris.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)', 27534920: \"This article has been retracted at the request of: Editor-in-Chief and Co-author 'Restoring sensitivity to oxaliplatin by a novel approach in gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo' by Banerjee, S., Kong, D., Azmi, A.

The hyaluronan-treated perforations closed faster than the untreated controls and showed less scar tissue. Initially the perforation became covered by a sheet of keratin and hyaluronan, which appeared to relax and orientate the retracted collagen fibres at the margin of the perforation. The hypertrophic stratified keratinizing squamous epithelium advanced within the hyaluronan-keratin cover and closed the perforation ahead of an approaching connective tissue. Three months after the closure, the hyaluronan-treated TMs appeared transparent in comparison to the opaque untreated controls. In histological sections the hyaluronan-treated TM was comparably thin and an organized collagen fibre layer was discernible. Hyaluronan of various concentrations (0.75, 1.0, 1.75 and 1.9%) and molecular weights (4 x 10(6) and 6 x 10(6)) were tested. The healing rate and degree of scar tissue was dependent on the concentration, but not on the molecular weight of the hyaluronan. Hyaluronan, at the higher concentration, healed the perforations faster and produced a less opaque TM than hyaluronan at low concentration. The number of applications of hyaluronan also influenced the healing rate; fewer applications resulted in a reduced rate. However, the quality of the healed TM was influenced to a lesser extent by the number of hyaluronan applications. Even single applications caused less scar tissue in comparison with untreated TMs. It is inferred from the study that hyaluronan, exogenously applied, might be valuable also in the clinical situation to enhance the healing of different types of TM perforation.', 19499278: StringElement('Open repair of full-thickness tears of the rotator cuff generally improves function, although anatomic failures are not uncommon.

The mean age of the patients at the time of surgery was 59 years. At a minimum 60-month followup (mean, 87 months; range, 60-133 months), we observed an improvement in the age- and gender-adjusted Constant-Murley score from 67% preoperatively to 95% postoperatively and in the pain score. With the last followup MRI, the supraspinatus tendon had reruptured in five patients (12%); the presence of a rerupture did not negatively influence the functional result.

We investigated the potential roles of PKC and PN-1 in neurite outgrowth of human neuroblastoma cell line, GOTO. Upon withdrawal of serum GOTO cells extended neurite processes within 3 h and formed fine network of neurites after 24 h. This morphological change was completely inhibited by thrombin and phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA). Withdrawal of serum increased the neurofilament (NF)-L and -M mRNA levels and thrombin did not inhibit the effect of withdrawal of serum. A potent PKC inhibitor, H-7 induced neurite outgrowth in the presence of serum, however, it did not increase the NF mRNA levels. Actinomycin D and cycloheximide did not inhibit the initial neurite outgrowth induced by withdrawal of serum, while these inhibited the increase in the NF mRNA levels. Thrombin retracted the serum depletion-induced neurites but did not retract the neurites induced by H-7. The specific activity and subcellular localization of PKC did not differ between GOTO cells cultured in serum-containing and -free media for 12 h. The serine protease inhibitory activity was undetectable in the serum-free conditioned medium of GOTO cells but the PN-1 mRNA was clearly detected by Northern blot analysis to a less extent than glial cells. Withdrawal of serum or treatment with H-7 did not increase the PN-1 mRNA level in GOTO cells, but thrombin increased its level about 7 folds in serum-free condition.

By 1 day postlesion, the nigrostriatal axons had retracted back to the level of the caudal globus pallidus. Over the next 6 days axonal retraction progressed down to the SN, and during the following 7 weeks 74% of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (TH(+)) and 84% of retrogradely labeled nigral neurons were lost, with a more pronounced loss in the rostral part of the SN. GDNF administration protected 70 and 72% of the nigral TH(+) and retrogradely labeled cell bodies, respectively, but did not prevent the die-back of the lesioned nigrostriatal axons.

Moreover, the lesion-induced deficits in forelimb akinesia and drug-induced rotation were not attenuated.

Effective treatment has proven increasingly difficult due to the spread of multidrug resistant strains and thus requires a deeper understanding of the biochemical mechanisms of pathogenicity. The central carbohydrate of the P. aeruginosa PAO1 (O5) B-band O-antigen, ManNAc(3NAc)A, has been shown to be critical for virulence and is produced in a stepwise manner by five enzymes in the Wbp pathway (WbpA, WbpB, WbpE, WbpD, and WbpI). Herein, we present the crystal structure of the aminotransferase WbpE from P. aeruginosa PAO1 in complex with the cofactor pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) and product UDP-GlcNAc(3NH(2))A as the external aldimine at 1.9 A resolution. We also report the structures of WbpE in complex with PMP alone as well as the PLP internal aldimine and show that the dimeric structure of WbpE observed in the crystal structure is confirmed by analytical ultracentrifugation. Analysis of these structures reveals that the active site of the enzyme is composed of residues from both subunits. In particular, we show that a key residue (Arg229), which has previously been implicated in direct interactions with the alpha-carboxylate moiety of alpha-ketoglutarate, is also uniquely positioned to bestow specificity for the 6''-carboxyl group of GlcNAc(3NH(2))A through a salt bridge. This finding is intriguing because while an analogous basic residue is present in WbpE homologues that do not process 6''-carboxyl-modified saccharides, recent structural studies reveal that this side chain is retracted to accommodate a neutral C6'' atom.

At the low concentration of 16 nM TPA, the outgrowth of long neurites was correlated with the increased appearance of membrane-filled varicosities and filopodial extensions along the axons. In contrast, treatment with high concentrations of TPA (160 nM) produced dense outgrowths which were shorter in length and organized as thick fascicles. Increased neurite fasciculation appeared to result from the enhanced side-to-side interactions of neighboring neurites by a neural cell adhesion molecule. Axons within these fascicles were retracted and appeared congested with cytoskeletal and membranous components. Treatment with the antibody to the neural cell adhesion molecule defasciculated the thick outgrowths and permitted further axonal elongation.', 15998609: StringElement('In October 2004, a flawed systematic review entitled \"Interactive Health Communication Applications for People with Chronic Disease\" was published in the Cochrane Library, accompanied by several press releases in which authors warned the public of the negative health consequences of interactive health communication applications, including the Internet.

When the movement of the nictitating membrane is recorded in the usual way, pulled out under load in cat, dog, or rabbit, end-plate-depolarizing drugs such as succinylcholine, decamethonium, nicotine, and 2268F, cause a retraction.2. This movement is due to activation of orbital striated muscle, as evidenced by the resistance of the movement to ganglion block or excision of the superior cervical ganglion and to administration of phentolamine or atropine, and by its great sensitivity to dimethyltubocurarine.3. End-plate-depolarizing drugs produce contractions of the superior and inferior oblique and of the recti muscles strong enough to account for the movements of the nictitating membrane, provided the known fascial connexions of the orbit allow transmission of a fraction of the extraocular muscle movement to the membrane.4. In post mortem specimens with the front of the orbit undisturbed, retraction of the central end of any of the ocular muscles produces movement of the nictitating membrane; the movement was greatest with the superior oblique and medial rectus. In vivo, detaching the superior oblique from its insertion into the globe sometimes abolished or reduced the response to end-plate-depolarizing drugs.5. With the membrane unloaded and retracted into the medial canthus, in the lightly anaesthetized or unanaesthetized dog or cat, these drugs cause a protrusion of the membrane, which can be sufficient to cover the cornea. This response also resists ganglion-block and is highly sensitive to dimethyltubocurarine.6. It is suggested that in the normal conscious animal the nictitating membrane is held retracted by a relatively small amount of sympathetic activity, and that its protrusion is an active mechanism under voluntary control mediated by the striated muscles of the orbit.7. The importance of these mechanisms in the interpretation of experiments in which the nictitating membrane is used are discussed.', 21663384: 'Strategies for nervous system repair arise from knowledge of growth mechanisms via a growth cone. The distinctive process of axon stretch growth is a robust, long-term growth that may reveal new pathways to accelerate nerve repair. Here, a live imaging bioreactor was engineered to closely explore cellular events initiated by applied tension. The stretch growth potential between adult and embryonic dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons was investigated, an important difference in nerve repair. Embryonic axons were capable of unidirectional stretch growth rates of 4?mm/d and reliably reached 4?cm in length within 2 weeks. Adult axons could only reach 2?mm/d and took over 3 weeks to reach 4?cm. Utilizing time-lapse imaging, we observed growth cone motility in coordination with stretch growth. Upon initiation of stretching, growth cones retracted. However, within 10?h of continuous stretching, growth cones extended at a rate of 0.2?mm/d opposite the direction of applied tension, contributing to overall axon elongation. We analyzed fast mitochondrial transport under increasing levels of strain to determine the effect of stretch on axonal transport. Transport began to diminish at 24% strain, and was almost completely absent at 39% strain. Surprisingly, axons recovered and were capable of subsequent stretch growth. When tension was completely released (?5% strain), stretch grown axons retracted at rates up to 6.1??m/sec and slowed as resting tension was restored. This ability to assess the process of axon stretch growth in real time will allow detailed study of how tension can be used to drive axonal growth and retraction.', 27070108: StringElement('Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a neurotrophic virus that can cause herpes stromal keratitis (HSK), a severe corneal inflammation that can lead to corneal scarring and blindness.

As ATP becomes poor, \\u03b5 changes the conformation from the down-state to the up-state and suppresses further ATP hydrolysis. Using TF(o)F(1) expressed in Escherichia coli, we compared TF(o)F(1) with up- and down-state \\u03b5 in the NTP (ATP, GTP, UTP, and CTP) synthesis reactions. TF(o)F(1) with the up-state \\u03b5 was achieved by inclusion of hexokinase in the assay and TF(o)F(1) with the down-state \\u03b5 was represented by \\u03b5\\u0394c-TF(o)F(1), in which \\u03b5 lacks C-terminal helices and hence cannot adopt the up-state under any conditions. The results indicate that TF(o)F(1) with the down-state \\u03b5 synthesizes GTP at the same rate of ATP, whereas TF(o)F(1) with the up-state \\u03b5 synthesizes GTP at a half-rate. Though rates are slow, TF(o)F(1) with the down-state \\u03b5 even catalyzes UTP and CTP synthesis.

DBPA facilitates the bacteria's colonization of human tissue by adhering to glycosaminoglycan (GAG), a sulfated polysaccharide. Interestingly, DBPA sequence variation among different strains of Borrelia spirochetes is high, resulting in significant differences in their GAG affinities. However, the structural mechanisms contributing to these differences are unknown. We determined the solution structures of DBPAs from strain N40 of B. burgdorferi and strain PBr of Borrelia garinii, two DBPA variants whose GAG affinities deviate significantly from strain B31, the best characterized version of DBPA. Our structures revealed that significant differences exist between PBr DBPA and B31/N40 DBPAs. In particular, the C-terminus of PBr DBPA, unlike C-termini from B31 and N40 DBPAs, is positioned away from the GAG-binding pocket and the linker between helices one and two of PBr DBPA is highly structured and retracted from the GAG-binding pocket. The repositioning of the C-terminus allowed the formation of an extra GAG-binding epitope in PBr DBPA and the retracted linker gave GAG ligands more access to the GAG-binding epitopes than other DBPAs. Characterization of GAG ligands' interactions with wild-type (WT) PBr and mutants confirmed the importance of the second major GAG-binding epitope and established the fact that the two epitopes are independent of one another and the new epitope is as important to GAG binding as the traditional epitope.\", 8421048: 'Lampbrush chromosomes from oocytes of the amphibian Triturus cristatus have been used to examine the role of histone acetylation in transcription by indirect immunofluorescence with antisera to H4 acetylated at specific lysine residues. Electrophoresis on acid-urea-Triton gels and Western blotting have confirmed the specificity of these antisera and defined the order in which particular lysine residues are acetylated in amphibian cells. As in mammals, lysine 16 is acetylated first, followed by 8 and/or 12 and then 5. With lampbrush chromosomes from immature (previtellogenic) oocytes, antisera to H4 acetylated at lysines 8, 12, and 16 labeled fluorescent foci at the bases of transcription loops. Antisera to H4 acetylated at lysine 5 labeled weakly (i.e., the tri- and tetraacetylated isoforms must be rare). Loops showed weak labeling of the chromatin axis but intense fluorescence at particular points, which probably represent incompletely decondensed chromatin. The RNP matrix of loops, including the RNP-rich sphere bodies and the dense matrix of \"marker\" loops, was not labeled. Treatment of immature oocytes with butyrate for 12 h to inhibit histone deacetylation did not affect immunolabeling, suggesting that turnover of H4 acetates is slow. In contrast, in chromosomes from mature oocytes, in which loops have retracted and transcription is low, butyrate caused an increase in labeling with all antisera, followed by the appearance of vestigial loops, weakly labeled, but with regions of intense fluorescence. These loops contain RNP and are presumably transcriptionally active. We conclude that H4 acetates turn over more rapidly in mature than immature oocytes and that histone hyperacetylation precedes, and possibly induces, loop formation and transcriptional activation.', 18423484: u'Culture of the pleasure oyster Crassostrea corteziensis is emerging as an alternative to the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) for oyster producers, who face severe mortalities since 1997 in Northwest M\\xe9xico. For determining the health status of this species, we conducted a histopathological analysis of cultured populations from two estuaries in the Pacific coast of M\\xe9xico. Macroscopical analysis revealed animals with transparent and retracted mantle. Histopathological analysis of these specimens showed tissue alterations and parasitic forms consistent with Perkinsus sp. infection. Stages of the parasite identified included tomont and trophozoites with an eccentric vacuole characteristic of Perkinsus spp. Pieces of tissues of infected oysters were incubated in Fluid Thioglycollate Medium (FTM) resulting in blue-black hypnospores after incubation. The identity of the parasite was confirmed by species specific PCR-based assay in DNA samples from oysters, tissue fractions from FTM cultures, and deparaffined samples with Perkinsus-like parasite detected by histology. Sequencing of positive amplified fragments (307bp) showed a sequence similar to Perkinsus marinus strain TXsc NTS ribosomal RNA gene (100% coverage and 98% identity, GenBank Accession No. AF497479.1) and to P. marinus, Genomic DNA, (100% coverage and 97% identity, GenBank Accession No. S78416.1). The prevalence of P. marinus varied from 1 to 5% in Boca del Camich\\xedn and from 1 to 6% in Pozo Chino. In general, the intensity of infection was moderate. The infection was observed in oysters from 31 to 110mm of shell length. This is the first record of P. marinus in oysters from the North America Pacific coast and the first record in C. corteziensis.

As a result, alphaIIbbeta(3) cannot be activated and cannot bind to fibrinogen, leading to a loss of platelet aggregation. Thrombasthenia is clinically characterized by mucocutaneous hemorrhage with episodes of intracranial and gastrointestinal bleeding. To develop methods for gene therapy of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a murine leukemia virus (MuLV)-derived vector, -889Pl(A2)beta(3), was transduced into peripheral blood CD34(+) cells from 2 patients with thrombasthenia with defects in the beta(3) gene. The human alphaIIb promoter was used in this vector to drive megakaryocyte-targeted expression of the wild-type beta(3) subunit. Proviral DNA and alphaIIbbeta(3) biosynthesis were detected after in vitro differentiation of transduced thrombasthenic CD34(+) cells with megakaryocyte growth and development factor. Flow cytometric analysis of transduced patient samples indicated that 19% of megakaryocyte progeny expressed alphaIIbbeta(3) on the surface at 34% of normal receptor levels. Treatment of transduced megakaryocytes with a combination of agonists including epinephrine and the thrombin receptor-activating peptide induced the alphaIIbbeta(3) complex to form an activated conformation capable of binding fibrinogen as measured by PAC-1 antibody binding. Transduced cells retracted a fibrin clot in vitro similar to megakaryocytes derived from a normal nonthrombasthenic individual. These results demonstrate ex vivo phenotypic correction of Glanzmann thrombasthenia and support the potential use of hematopoietic CD34(+) cells as targets for alphaIIb promoter-driven MuLV vectors for gene therapy of platelet disorders.

Retracted clots were resistant to fibrinolysis in a milieu without dissolved plasminogen, because the amount of fibrin-bound plasminogen in retracted clots was insufficient for successful clot lysis. In plasma containing plasminogen, retracted clots were successfully lysed with fibrin-specific plasminogen activators, but not with non-fibrin-specific activators. Preincubation of retracted clots in plasma increased their plasminogen content as well as their sensitivity to fibrinolysis. The rate of lysis was increased up to 100-times when plasminogen activator and plasminogen were introduced into cylindrical clots by pressure-induced bulk flow in comparison with diffusion alone. The magnitude of the increase was similar in retracted and nonretracted clots, but the absolute rate of lysis was faster in non-retracted clots. The influence of fibrin fiber thickness on fibrinolysis was studied by atomic force microscopy. The time to complete lateral section of fibers did not differ between thick and thin composite fibers, and the rate of diameter reduction was faster in thick fibers than in thin ones. Taken together our results suggest that lysis of retracted clots proceeds in circular stages: (a) activation of bound plasminogen followed by partial degradation of fibrin, (b) opening of new plasminogen-binding sites on partly degraded fibrin, (c) binding of plasminogen to the new binding sites which enhances the susceptibility of clots to lysis. Lysis is accelerated by bulk flow of plasminogen activator and plasminogen into clots in comparison to diffusion alone. Fibrinolysis of thick composite fibrin fibers proceeds more efficiently than lysis of thin fibers.', 12871374: 'Plasmin, the direct fibrinolytic enzyme, was compared with tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) in an in vitro thrombolysis model. Plasmin has been prepared in a highly pure form from human plasma and has been stabilized against auto-degradation by low-pH formulation. This acidified formulation of plasmin has been designed to have a low buffering capacity so that it can be directly infused into clots in a stable and latently active form. This low-pH formulation has been shown to be equivalent to a neutral-pH formulation of plasmin in its extent of clot lysis. An in vitro model of catheter-assisted thrombolysis has been devised in which large (12 x 0.6 cm), retracted clots are treated with an intrathrombus thrombolytic agent via a multi-sideport catheter. Plasmin dissolves these plasminogen-deficient clots in a dose-dependent manner and is clearly superior to t-PA. In this model system, t-PA exhibits efficacy only when retracted clots are replenished with plasminogen.', 20397777: StringElement('The use of protons for curative treatment of prostate cancer is increasing, either as a single treatment modality or in combination with conventional radiotherapy.

The percentage of morphologically changed cells was used to quantify changes in heat sensitivity, or resistance, in response to mitogenic stimulation. Stimulating quiescent cells with serum or with the specific growth factors epidermal growth factor (EGF) and prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) markedly increased the heat resistance to a 46 degrees C treatment, but only when the heat treatment, but only when the heat treatment was applied within 2-3 h after the addition. When insulin (which is not mitogenic, but synergistic with EGF and PGF2 alpha in these cells) was added alone or in combination with either EGF or PGF2 alpha, it has no effect on the development of heat resistance. Neither did cycloheximide nor tunicamycin inhibit heat resistance induced by EGF, and cycloheximide even enhanced it after 2-4 h. However, adding colcemid before or at the beginning of the heat treatment abolished the increased heat resistance. The results indicate that the resistance to a single heat treatment at 46 degrees C may be related to changes in the metabolic state after mitogenic stimulation, even though these changes need not be reflected in the rate of entry into S phase.

Proteomics, the analysis of all proteins of a system at a defined state, has gained increasing interest in hematology as a diagnostic tool. The application of proteomics in transfusion medicine holds promise to revolutionize quality assessment and therapeutic monitoring. The potential of proteomics as a viable tool for the identification of the PSL has since increased dramatically with the development of mass spectrometry and has required the development of quantitative proteomic techniques such as differential gel electrophoresis, isotope-coded affinity tagging, and isotope tagging for relative and absolute quantitation. In principle, two main areas in the field of proteomics have been developed, each of them having its pros and cons. These fields are \"profiling\" and \"functional\" proteomics. With the recent implementation of pathogen reduction technologies (PRT) a new dimension of challenges has appeared on the horizon. The treatment of platelet concentrates with either UV-A and a photo sensitizer or UV-C revealed acceleration of PSL development. In conclusion, proteomics thus provides an excellent tool to decode complex processes by identifying novel platelet-expressed proteins and analysing functional changes of the platelet proteome. These recent results suggest that protein kinases might represent one important group of proteins involved in the development of PSL and provide a potential target for inhibition in order to reduce development of PSL. Bacterial risk receives and deserves a lot of attention when it comes to extension of platelet storage; however, determining the quality of platelets during storage needs to be treated with equal importance.

This study uses [14C]-2-DG to map the olfactory system of a terrestrial snail, Achatina fulica. The olfactory organ in the snail's tentacles bears a striking resemblance to the vertebrate olfactory mucosa. There are also complex neural structures in the tentacle and brain that are devoted to subsequent processing. These facts make the molluscan olfactory system a suitable complement to the traditional vertebrate and insect models in olfaction. The experiments utilized intact snails in which one tentacle was exposed to a controlled odor environment while the contralateral tentacle was held in a retracted position. The dose of [14C]-2-DG (2 microCi/gm) was injected into the hemocele. Tissue processing involved freeze-substitution with acetone, dry sectioning, and the preparation of liquid film autoradiographs. Optical density measurements permitted quantitative comparisons between experimental conditions. The natural odors of conspecific snails and of carrots elicited significantly more uptake of 2-DG in the exposed tentacle than in the unexposed tentacle and, in the exposed tentacle, significantly more label over the axons of the primary sensory neurons than was elicited by exposure to clean air. Amyl acetate and octanol were less effective. A small number of superficially placed sensory neurons were labeled in all stimulus conditions, including clean air, and may represent the mechanosensors. Stimulus-dependent labeling in the brain was limited to the procerebrum and included both neuropilar and cellular parts.

We used data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey and regional and global climate indices to examine the effects of climate change on the breeding distribution of the Rusty Blackbird (Euphagus carolinus), a formerly common species that is rapidly declining. We found that the range of the Rusty Blackbird retracted northward by 143 km since the 1960s and that the probability of local extinction was highest at the southern range margin. Furthermore, we found that the mean breeding latitude of the Rusty Blackbird was significant and positively correlated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation with a lag of six years. Because the annual distribution of the Rusty Blackbird is affected by annual weather patterns produced by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, our results support the hypothesis that directional climate change over the past 40 years is contributing to the decline of the Rusty Blackbird.

All measurements were made on membranes of retraction zones, cell segments from which the sarcoplasm had retracted. Quantitative morphological studies indicated that three deforming forces interact with the intrinsic elastic properties of the sarcolemma to determine membrane configuration in retraction zone segments. The three deforming forces, namely intrazone pressure, axial fiber loads, and radial stresses introduced by retracted cell contents, could all be experimentally removed, permitting determination of the \"undeformed\" configuration of the sarcolemma. Analysis of these results indicated that membrane of intact fibers at rest length is about four times as wide and two-thirds as long as undeformed membrane. Membrane geometry was also studied as a function of internal hydrostatic pressure and axial loading to permit calculation of the circumferential and longitudinal tension-strain (T-S) diagrams. The sarcolemma exhibited nonlinear T-S properties concave to the tension axis in both directions. Circumferential T-S slopes (measures of membrane stiffness) ranged from 1500 to greater than 50,000 dynes/cm over the range of deformations investigated, while longitudinal T-S slopes varied from 23,000 to 225,000 dynes/cm. Thus, the membrane is anisotropic, being much stiffer in the longitudinal direction.

For the surgical correction of the tip and columella, a complete septal extension graft, along with augmentation rhinoplasty has been developed. However, the use of this type of graft is frequently problematic because the septal cartilage is not large enough. In a study involving 10 cadavers, a complete septal extension graft was achieved in two of them by using septal cartilage harvested according to standard techniques. Therefore, the septal cartilage was harvested, leaving a 5-mm L-shaped strut, and a complete septal extension graft was implanted. The present report describes the results obtained in 34 patients and offers an analysis of the results as judged by the columella-labial angle and three proportional indices (nose height index, nasal bridge length index, and nasal tip projection index), measured by photogrammetry. The postoperative values obtained in these four categories increased significantly compared to the preoperative ones, thus confirming that the projection of tip was augmented, the nose was lengthened, and the columella was advanced caudally.

Using data from a national survey of mandated reporters that included vignettes in which case and personal characteristics were systematically varied, this paper examines the impact of selected characteristics while controlling for others. The data reveal that respondents noticed and responded to case characteristics. Abuse-relevant judgments and reporting intentions varied, often substantially, as a function of case characteristics. Three case characteristics--previous abuse, severity of abuse, and recantation--were powerful predictors of vignette outcomes. A history of previous abuse led to judgments of greater seriousness, a more salutary impact of a report, and greater likelihood of reporting. More severe abuse was more likely to be labelled as abuse, and was more likely to be reported. When the alleged victim retracted her accusation upon questioning by an authority figure, respondents were significantly less likely to intend a report. Child age, perpetrator intent and family socioeconomic status also influenced abuse-relevant judgments and reporting intentions. Respondents were more likely to intend a report when younger children, lazy or angry perpetrators and children from poorer families were portrayed.', 22695776: u\"Data from natural sources show counter-intuitive distribution patterns for the leading digits to the left of the decimal point and the digit 1 is observed more frequently than all other numbers.

Anesthesiology journals are affected not only by ghostwriting and plagiarism but also by counterfeiting. In the present study 20 publications in anesthesiology known to be falsified by an author were investigated for irregularities with respect to Benford's law using the \\u03c7(2)-test and the Z-test. In the 20 retracted publications an average first-digit frequency of 243.1 (standard deviation SD \\xb1 118.2, range: 30-592) and an average second-digit frequency of 132.3 (SD \\xb1 72.2, range: 15-383) were found. The observed distribution of the first and second digits to the left of the decimal point differed significantly (p< 0.01) from the expected distribution described by Benford. Only the observed absolute frequencies for digits 3, 4 and 5 did not differ significantly from the expected values. In an analysis of each paper 17 out of 20 studies differed significantly from the expected value for the first digit and 18 out of 20 studies varied significantly from the expected value of the second digit. Only one paper did not vary significantly from expected values for the digits to the left of the decimal. For comparison, a meta-analysis using complex mathematical procedures was chosen as a control. The analysis showed a first-digit distribution consistent with the Benford distribution. Thus, the method used in the present study seems to be sensitive for detecting fraud. Additional statements of specificity cannot yet be made as this requires further analysis of data that is definitely not falsified.

There are several classification schemes for AOM that may impact management decisions: patients with acute, persistent, recurrent, or chronic AOM may have a different distribution of bacterial pathogens and a different likelihood of success from antimicrobial therapy. Patient age, prior treatment history and daycare attendance are other important variables. The natural history of AOM without antibiotic treatment is generally favorable; however, from the few studies available, this is difficult to quantitate because the diagnosis was infrequently confirmed by tympanocentesis leaving the possibility that many patients entered into these trials may not have had bacterial AOM. Antibiotic choices should reflect pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data and clinical trial results demonstrating effectiveness in eradication of the most likely pathogens based on tympanocentesis sampling and antibiotic sensitivity testing. Thereafter, compliance factors such as formulation, dosing schedule and duration of treatment and accessibility factors such as availability and cost should be taken into account. The increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance among AOM pathogens and the changing susceptibility profiles of these bacteria should be considered in antibiotic selection. Current best practice recommends amoxicillin for uncomplicated AOM; continuing or switching to an alternative antibiotic based on clinical response after 48 hours of therapy; and selection of second line antibiotics as first line choices when the patient has already been on an antibiotic within the previous month or is otitis prone. Preferred second-line agents frequently noted in various guidelines include amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefdinir, cefpodoxime, cefprozil, and cefuroxime.

To relate cellular mechanisms to pathogenesis and immune protection, we studied the cytotoxicity of the Histophilus somni immunoglobulin-binding protein A (IbpA) direct repeat 2 Fic domain (DR2/Fic) for natural host target cells. Live virulent IbpA-producing H. somni strain 2336, a cell-free culture supernatant (CCS) of this strain, or recombinant DR2/Fic (rDR2/Fic) caused dramatic retraction and rounding of bovine alveolar type 2 (BAT2) epithelial cells. IbpA-deficient H. somni strain 129Pt and a Fic motif His(298)Ala mutant rDR2/Fic protein were not cytotoxic. The cellular mechanism of DR2/Fic cytotoxicity was demonstrated by incubation of BAT2 cell lysates with strain 2336 CCS or rDR2/Fic in the presence of [alpha-(32)P]ATP, which resulted in adenylylation of Rho GTPases and cytoskeletal disruption. Since IbpA is not secreted by type III or type IV secretion systems, we determined whether DR2/Fic entered the host cytoplasm to access its Rho GTPase targets. Although H. somni did not invade BAT2 cells, DR2/Fic was internalized by cells treated with H. somni, CCS, or the rDR2/Fic protein, as shown by confocal immunomicroscopy. Transwell bacterial migration assays showed that large numbers of strain 2336 bacteria migrated between retracted BAT2 cells, but IbpA-deficient strain 129Pt did not cross a monolayer unless the monolayer was pretreated with strain 2336 CCS or rDR2/Fic protein. Antibody to rDR2/Fic or passively protective convalescent-phase serum blocked IbpA-mediated cytotoxicity and inhibited H. somni transmigration across BAT2 monolayers, confirming the role of DR2/Fic in pathogenesis and corresponding to the results for in vivo protection in previous animal studies.', 395161: \"Antibodies to calf thymus histone H2B were purified by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and injected into oocyte nuclei of Pleurodeles waltlii. As shown by indirect immunofluorescence these antibodies cross-reacted strongly with corresponding histones associated with lampbrush chromosomes. Shortly after injection the lateral loops of the chromosomes retracted into the chromomeres and by 3 h postinjection the 'lampbrush' appearance was completely lost and the chromosomes appeared in light-microscopic preparations as rod-like structures consisting of longitudinally coalesced chromomeres. In control oocytes injected with non-immune immunoglobulins or antibodies against a ubiquitous transcript-associated protein no morphological alterations of the lampbrush chromosomes could be observed. Electron microscopic spreads of chromosomes prepared at various times after injection of anti-H2B revealed a progressive loss of transcriptional complexes from the loop axes. Finally, higher-order chromatin configurations, like supranucleosomal globules ('superbeads') or cable-like chromatin strands 50-60 nm thick predominated, indicating complete transcriptional inactivation of all chromosomal regions. The results indicate that H2B antibodies react specifically with histones associated with the transcribed DNA of lateral loops in their native state. The resulting antigen-antibody complexes seem to inhibit progression of the RNA polymerases along the template, thus causing the premature release of transcripts, a process analogous to the stripping effect of actinomycin D. The demonstration of histones associated with heavily transcribed regions, which are not compacted into nucleosomes but largely extended, supports the current concept that unfolding of nucleosomes to allow transcription of the DNA does not involve dissociation of histones. In contrast, amplified ribosomal RNA genes are unaffected by injected H2B antibodies. This does not necessarily indicate absence of histones from nucleolar chromatin, since we do not know whether it is accessible in vivo to antibodies or whether the histone antigenic determinants are masked by the presence of other proteins. The technique of injecting specific antibodies should be widely applicable when analysing the in vivo distribution of chromosomal components at the electron-microscopic level and when studying complex metabolic processes, like the cleavage and modification of RNA, by selective inhibition of defined enzymic steps.\", 5840795: 'The thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes were studied in runt disease induced by a graft of intravenously injected homologous splenic cells into newborn rats and mice. Adult Long-Evans cells (70 x 10(6)) were injected into Sprague-Dawley rats. Adult DBA cells (7 x 10(6)) were injected into C57BL/6 mice. Runted rats were sacrificed at 14 to 28 days of age; mice at 10 to 20 days. The thymic cortex is depleted of small lymphocytes. Those remaining are severely damaged and phagocytized. Evidence of damage includes swelling of mitochondria, myelin figure formation, margination of chromatin, and sharp angulation in nuclear contour. Large numbers of macrophages are present. Epithelial-reticular cells which envelop small cortical blood vessels are often retracted, with the result that the most peripheral layer in the thymic-blood barrier suffers abnormally large gaps. Lymphocytes of the periarterial lymphatic sheaths of spleen and of the cortex of lymph nodes are reduced in number and damaged. Vast numbers of plasma cells and many lymphocytes are evident throughout lymph nodes, in the periarterial lymphatic sheaths, and in the marginal zone and red pulp of the spleen. Plasma cells are of different sizes, the larger having dilated sacs of endoplasmic reticulum. Lymphocytes are small to medium in size. They contain, in varying quantity, ribosomes and smooth membrane-bounded cytoplasmic vesicles approximately 350 to 500 A in diameter. Most plasma cells and lymphocytes are damaged and many of these are phagocytized. Many lymphocytes in lymph nodes, however, show no evidence of damage.

This study attempted to develop novel tissue-engineering approaches using tenocyte-seeded bioscaffolds for tendon reconstruction of massive rotator cuff tendon defect in rabbits. Porcine small intestine submucosa (Restore) and type I/III collagen bioscaffold (ACI-Maix) were chosen as bioscaffold carriers for autologous tenocytes. Biological characterization of autologous tenocytes was conducted before the implantation. The tenocyte-seeded bioscaffolds were implanted as interposition grafts to reconstruct massive rotator cuff tendon defects in rabbits. In situ reimplantation of the autologous rotator cuff tendon, excised during defect creation, served as a positive control. Histological outcomes were analyzed and semi-quantitatively graded at 4 and 8 weeks after surgery. At 4 weeks, both tenocyte-seeded bioscaffolds displayed inflammatory reaction similar to bioscaffold-only cuff reconstruction, and the histological grading were inferior to control repair. However, at 8 weeks, inflammatory reaction of both tenocyte-seeded bioscaffolds were dramatically less than with bioscaffold alone. In addition, bioscaffolds seeded with tenocytes generated a histological appearance similar to that of the positive control. The implantation of autologous tenocytes on collagen-based bioscaffolds results in better rotator cuff tendon healing and remodeling than with the implantation of bioscaffold alone.', 24846238: 'The prevalence of obesity increases and is associated with increases in co-morbidities e.g. type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, heart disease, stroke, asthma, several forms of cancer, depression, and may result in reduction of expected remaining lifespan. We have reviewed the adverse effects on the cardiovascular system of anti-obesity drugs now retracted from the market as well as the cardiovascular profile of current drugs and potential pathways which are considered for treatment of obesity. Fenfluramine, and sibutramine were withdrawn due to increased cardiovascular risk, while an inverse agonist at cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptors, rimonobant was withdrawn due to serious psychiatric problems. At present there are only few treatments available including orlistat and, phentermine alone or in combination with topiramate and lorcaserin, although cardiovascular side effects need to be clarified regarding phentermine and lorcaserin. Drugs approved for type 2 diabetes including glucagon like peptide (GLP-1) analogues and metformin also cause moderate weight losses and have a favourable cardiovascular profile, while the anti-obesity potential of nebivolol remains unexplored. Pathways with anti-obesity potential include sirtuin activation, blockade of transient receptor potential (TRPV1) channels, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 and 2 inhibitors, uncoupling protein activators, bile acids, crotonins, CB1 antagonists, but the cardiovascular profile remains to be investigated. For type 2 diabetes, new drug classes with possible advantageous cardiovascular profiles, e.g. GLP-1 analogues and sodium-glucose co-transport type 2 inhibitors, are associated with weight loss and are currently being evaluated as anti-obesity drugs.', 8824735: 'Analysis of the motile behavior of a strain of Dictyostelium lacking a myosin I, myoA, revealed that this mutant strain formed pseudopods and turned twice as frequently as wild type cells [Titus et al., 1993: Mol. Biol. Cell 4:233-246]. The basis for this aberrant behavior has been explored using three-dimensional reconstructions of translocating cells. Wild type cells form approximately 40% of pseudopods on the substratum and 60% off the substratum. The majority of pseudopods formed on the substratum initiate sharp turns while the majority of pseudopods formed off the substratum are retracted. Although myoA- cells form pseudopods at roughly twice the frequency of wild type cells, the increase in frequency is specific for only those pseudopods formed on the substratum. This increase is the basis for the aberrant increase in turning in myoA- cells. The selective increase in the frequency of pseudopods formed on the substratum correlates with a number of additional abnormalities in myoA- pseuodpod formation. First, myoA- cells can simultaneously extend more than one pseudopod, whereas wild type cells extend only one pseudopod at a time. Second, although wild type and myoA- pseudopods achieve the same final volumes, myoA- pseudopods grow at half the rate of wild type pseudopods and, therefore, take longer to achieve final volume. Third, while a wild type pseudopod grows in a continuous fashion, a myoA- pseudopod grows in a discontinuous fashion. Together, these results demonstrate that myoA plays a fundamental role in controlling the frequency of only those pseudopods formed on the substratum, and that maintenance of the normal frequency of pseudopod formation appears to be necessary for the normal velocity of cellular translocation, the normal frequency of turning, the normal rate of average pseudopod growth, and the high efficiency of chemotaxis. These results in turn indicate that pseudopod formation is precisely coordinated in space and time, and actin-associated proteins like myoA play key roles in coordination.', 2891681: 'Pili, along with the flagellum and DNA bacteriophage receptors, are structural markers for polar morphogenesis in Caulobacter crescentus. Pili act as primary receptors for a number of small, C. crescentus-specific DNA and RNA bacteriophages, and the timing of pilus-dependent adsorption of bacteriophage phiCb5 in synchronized cell populations has led to the general conclusion that pili are formed coordinately with the flagellum and other polar surface structures in the predivisional cell. The use of rotary platinum shadow casting and electron microscopy as a direct assay for formation of flagella and pili in synchronous cell cultures now shows, however, that when expressed as fractions of the swarmer cell cycle, flagella are assembled on the predivisional cells at approximately 0.8 and that pili are assembled on the new swarmer cells at approximately 0.1 of the next cell cycle. Adsorption of pilus-specific bacteriophage phiCb5 prevented the loss of pili from swarmer cells during development, which suggests that these structures are retracted at the time of stalk formation. Examination of temperature-sensitive cell division mutants showed that the assembly of pili depends on completion of cell separation. These results indicate that the stage-specific events required for polar morphogenesis in C. crescentus occur sequentially, rather than coordinately in the cell cycle, and that the timing of these events reflects the order of underlying cell cycle steps.', 24004521: StringElement('As a result of reporting bias, or frauds, false or misunderstood findings may represent the majority of published research claims.

Histological evaluation was made of 22 cristae ampullaris from one normal and six post-treatment (PT) animal groups killed at 1, 4, 7, 14, 28, and 56 days. New hair cell production was quantified, using the dissector technique. Transmission electron microscopy was used to investigate the ultrastructural characteristics of the hair cells in the regenerated epithelium. At 1 day PT, type I and II hair cells presented cytoplasmic vacuolization, swollen nerve calyces and 20% of type I and 18% of type II hair cells were lost. At 4 days PT, 95% of type I hair cells and 14% of type II hair cells had disappeared. In addition, most of the type II hair cells showed clumping of nuclear material. Nerve fibers were not found in the sensory epithelium, but were still observed below the basal lamina. Supporting cells appeared unaffected, maintaining their location in the crista. At 1 and 4 days PT, the damage to hair cells was more pronounced in the central region of the crista ampullaris. The degree of ototoxic damage at 7 days was similar to that of 14 days: no type I hair cells were present and most of the type II hair cells had disappeared; supporting cell nuclei began to occupy the apical part of the sensory epithelium and most of the nerve fibers had retracted. Quantitatively, 87 and 93% of type II hair cells were lost at 7 and 14 days PT, respectively. Initial signs of hair cell recovery began at 28 days PT; immature type II-like hair cells appeared, supporting cell nuclei began to align at the base of the sensory epithelium and nerve fibers penetrating the basal lamina were observed. No type I hair cells were found, but 40% of the normal number of type II hair cells were present. Hair cells appeared to regenerate in the peripheral areas of the cristae ampullaris first. At 56 days PT, an increase in the number of mature type II hair cells was present, supporting cells were aligned at the base of the epithelium, and more nerve fibers appeared to penetrate the basal lamina to the sensory epithelium. Although type I hair cells were absent from the epithelium 55% of the normal number of type II hair cells were present. At this time, more regenerated hair cells were located in the center of the cristae ampullaris as compared to the periphery. At the transmission electron microscopic level, type II hair cells at different stages of maturation were observed. Some exhibited mature stereocilia, a cuticular plate, and terminal endings with synaptic specialization opposing these hair cells. In conclusion, type I hair cells were more sensitive than type II hair cells to gentamicin intoxication (as they disappeared as early as 4 days PT). After 56 days PT, the number of type II hair cells reached 55% of normal. No type I hair cells had regenerated at this time. These results demonstrate quantitatively the differential ototoxic sensitivity and regenerative capacity of hair cells.', 23881659: StringElement('Hydroxyethyl starches (HES) are synthetic colloids commonly used for fluid resuscitation to replace intravascular volume, yet they have been increasingly associated with adverse effects on kidney function.

The authors of the paper wish to retract the paper due to the discovery of a calculation error in the processing of the raw data. The discovered error concerns the calculation of the specific uptake/secretion rates for several metabolites in one of the experimental conditions, i.e. glutamine omission (called Q0). In other words, in Figure 2, the variations of the metabolic fluxes for the condition Q0 are not correct. When this error is corrected, the resulting mathematical model changes (in particular for the results associated with Q0 conditions), several figures and tables are modified, and the interpretation of the fluxes in Q0 has to be slightly modified. Therefore the authors wish to retract the article. However, the error does not affect the modelling approach or the methodology presented in the article. Therefore, a revised version with the correct data has since been published: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168165617302663.

The needle of the Insyte AutoGuard intravenous cannula can be retracted into the safety barrel. One hundred patients were randomly allocated to receive either an 18-gauge conventional Insyte intravenous cannula (group C) or the AutoGuard cannula (group AG) to assess the ease of use and efficacy of the AutoGuard device. It was possible to insert the cannula into the vein within two attempts in all patients; there was no significant difference between two groups with respect to ease of insertion. No problems, such as inadvertent withdrawal of the needle, occurred during insertion in any patient. Handling the withdrawn needle was judged significantly safer in group AG than in group C (p < 0.001). Blood contamination often occurred where a withdrawn needle was placed in group C, whereas no blood stain was detected in any case in group AG (p < 0.001). The AutoGuard cannula provides safer handling of a withdrawn needle without reducing its ease of insertion.', 3590080: 'The primary goal of this study was to develop a method for evaluating fibrin-specific antibodies as thrombus detecting agents. The apparatus and assay conditions were chosen by testing antibody 64C5, which binds to the amino terminus of the fibrin beta chain, for its ability to bind to human blood clots. Using 125I-labeled antibody 64C5, the effects of antibody concentration, clot shape, clot mass, temperature, and flow rate were tested. Increased antibody binding was observed when antibody concentration, clot mass and temperature were increased. Under one set of conditions, six 125I-labeled monoclonal antifibrin antibodies (four specific for the beta chain, two specific for the alpha chain) were tested for their binding to retracted clots of human blood. Two radioiodinated antidigoxin antibodies were used as a control. Beta chain-specific antibody 59D8, which provided the highest level of binding to clot, bound 14-fold better than the control antidigoxin antibody. Neither alpha chain-specific antibody bound to clotted blood. To examine the in vivo relevance of the in vitro binding to clots, the uptake of antibody 64C5 was assessed for its binding to human fibrin clotted within the jugular vein of a rabbit. The correlation coefficient between in vitro and in vivo uptake as a function of clot weight was calculated to be 0.91. Thus, in vitro binding of monoclonal antifibrin antibodies to human blood clots was judged to be a realistic method for the comparison and selection of an ideal antifibrin antibody for detailed in vivo testing.', 24928194: 'Retraction of flawed articles is an important mechanism for correction of the scientific literature. We recently reported that the majority of retractions are associated with scientific misconduct. In the current study, we focused on the subset of retractions for which no misconduct was identified, in order to identify the major causes of error. Analysis of the retraction notices for 423 articles indexed in PubMed revealed that the most common causes of error-related retraction are laboratory errors, analytical errors, and irreproducible results. The most common laboratory errors are contamination and problems relating to molecular biology procedures (e.g., sequencing, cloning). Retractions due to contamination were more common in the past, whereas analytical errors are now increasing in frequency. A number of publications that have not been retracted despite being shown to contain significant errors suggest that barriers to retraction may impede correction of the literature. In particular, few cases of retraction due to cell line contamination were found despite recognition that this problem has affected numerous publications. An understanding of the errors leading to retraction can guide practices to improve laboratory research and the integrity of the scientific literature. Perhaps most important, our analysis has identified major problems in the mechanisms used to rectify the scientific literature and suggests a need for action by the scientific community to adopt protocols that ensure the integrity of the publication process.', 25087939: StringElement(\"Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of using prophylactic meshes to achieve abdominal wall closure, decreasing the risk of incisional hernia.

This study examines the value of solid-phase microextraction (SPME) for sampling perchlorethylene in the atmosphere of dry cleaning shops. Carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (CAR/PDMS) in 0.5-cm retracted mode was selected. There were no significant differences between sampling rates at different temperatures (range of 20 to 30 \\xb0C) and air velocities (2 to 50 cm/s). On the opposite, relative humidity (RH) had a significant effect on sampling rates. Method reproducibility was realized in the laboratory and field conditions and was 6.2 % and 7 to 11 %, respectively. Repeatability was also determined as 8.9 %. Comparison of the results according to the American Industrial Hygiene Association exposure assessment strategy showed the SPME sampler yields more conservative results in comparison with traditional standard method.', 4607944: 'Mouse neuroblastoma cells (clone NB2a) were cultured in the presence of 0.3-2.1% halothane in the gas phase for up to 72 h. Halothane inhibited neurite extension dose dependently and virtually abolished microspike formation even at the lowest concentration tested. These effects were completely reversible. Electron microscopy demonstrated that microfilaments measuring 40-80 A in diameter are the only fibrous organelles visible within microspikes. When the cells were exposed to halothane, no microfilamentous complexes could be identified in any cells and the subcortical regions of neurites often appeared devoid of individual microfilaments. Microtubules were still present in neurites after exposure to halothane concentrations at which microfilaments disappeared. However, at concentrations above 1.0%, microtubules gradually appeared to decrease in number. Short-term experiments showed that existing neurites and microspikes rapidly retracted when suddenly exposed to culture medium equilibrated with 1.0% halothane and quickly reformed when the halothane was removed. The inhibition of neuroblastoma cell differentiation by halothane appears to be mediated by disruption of 40-80 A diameter microfilaments.', 22184610: StringElement('Recent research suggests that 6% hydroxyethyl starch (HES) 130/0.4 is one of the most frequently used resuscitation fluids worldwide.

The upper and lower lips were retracted by 6 mm and 7 mm, respectively. This helped reduce the mentalis strain and improve chin projection.

We have designed a novel stereoscopic 3D imaging device with 5 DOF and remote control that can be inserted and attached in the body cavity. The device, contained within a 11/16\" tube, includes two miniature cameras and five small motors that position the cameras to provide a stereoscopic view of the surgical site. When inserted the cameras are retracted and protected by an outer shell. After the device is fixed within the abdominal cavity, a motor rotates an inner shell to expose the cameras. Once exposed, the cameras can tilt in tandem, translate independently along the axis of the tube, and independently pan. The software controls the cameras to create new views for the surgeon, to move along the adjustable baseline, to verge for stereoscopic viewing, and to potentially track moving organs. We have completed a proof of concept design, which includes CAD models and animations of the device, and we are currently building a physical prototype.

Following this nuclear movement, which we call \"nucleokinesis,\" the posterior pseudopodium is retracted behind the nucleus. Thus, extension of a pseudopodium followed by nucleokinesis in the same direction and retraction of the cell body behind the nucleus is a normal motile sequence in translocating bipolar cells. This suggests that nucleokinesis is a distinct step in whole-cell translocation of bipolar cells on biological substrata and that pseudopodia can be used as nuclear transport organs.

The quality of the torn muscle and tendon along with the length of the remnant tendon stump should be considered before deciding on the most appropriate repair technique. When muscle and tendon quality are sufficient, the tear can often be repaired directly to the remnant tendon stump and compressed onto the greater tuberosity. If the remnant tendon stump is degenerative, of insufficient length, or lacks tendon in which to place sutures, an allograft patch can be used to augment the repair. When the quality of the remaining muscle and tendon are poor or when the muscle is retracted too far medially and is nonmobile, a bridging technique such as superior capsule reconstruction is preferable.
