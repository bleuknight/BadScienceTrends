There was significantly more binding of trifoliin A to purified LPS and cells in the early stationary phase than to cells in the exponential phase. Immunofluorescence and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays indicated that new antigenic determinants of the LPS appeared for brief periods on cells at the end of the lag phase and again at the beginning of the stationary phase. These new antigens were not detected on cells in midexponential or late stationary phase. Monovalent fragments of immunoglobulin G antibodies raised against the unique antigenic determinants in the LPS competitively blocked the binding of trifoliin A to cells in the early stationary phase. Gas chromatographic analysis showed that the relative quantity of several glycosyl components in the LPS increased as the culture advanced from the midexponential to the early stationary phase. In addition, LPS from cells in the early stationary phase had a higher aggregate molecular weight. Quinovosamine (2-amino-2,6-dideoxyglucose) was identified by combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as a sugar component of the LPS which had not been previously reported. D-Quinovosamine, N-acetyl-D-quinovosamine, and its n-propyl-beta-glycoside were effective hapten sugars which inhibited the binding of trifoliin A, anti-clover root antibody, and homologous antibody to these new determinants in the LPS. White clover plants had more infected root hairs after incubation with an inoculum of cells in the early stationary phase than after incubation with cells in the midexponential phase. The profound influence of the growth phase on the composition of lectin-binding polysaccharides of Rhizobium may be a major underlying cause of conflicting data among laboratories testing the lectin-recognition hypothesis. In addition, these chemical modifications may reflect mechanisms which regulate Rhizobium-root hair recognition in this nitrogen-fixing symbiosis.', 17304577: 'Normal physiologic functions of the cellular prion protein (PrPc) are still elusive. This GPI-anchored protein exerts many functions, including roles in neuron proliferation, neuroprotection or redox homeostasis. There are, however, conflicting data concerning its role in synaptic transmission. Although several studies report that PrPc participates in NMDA-mediated neurotransmission, parallel studies describe normal behavior of PrPc-mutant mice. Abnormal axon connections have been described in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampi of PrPc-deficient mice similar to those observed in epilepsy. A study indicates increased susceptibility to kainate (KA) in these mutant mice. We extend the observation of these studies by means of several histologic and biochemical analyses of KA-treated mice. PrPc-deficient mice showed increased sensitivity to KA-induced seizures in vivo and in vitro in organotypic slices. In addition, we show that this sensitivity is cell-specific because interference experiments to abolish PrPc expression increased susceptibility to KA in PrPc-expressing cells. We indicate a correlation of susceptibility to KA in cells lacking PrPc with the differential expression of GluR6 and GluR7 KA receptor subunits using real-time RT-PCR methods. These results indicate that PrPc exerts a neuroprotective role against KA-induced neurotoxicity, probably by regulating the expression of KA receptor subunits.', 26998793: StringElement('Over the years studies have shown conflicting results about the risk of suicide in psychotic depression (MD-psych).

This paper considers the use of spatial information technology as a medium to integrate and visualise spatial distributions of both quantitative scientific data and qualitative local knowledge for the purposes of producing valid and locally relevant fisheries management plans. In this context, the paper presents a detailed protocol for the collection and subsequent use of local knowledge in fisheries management planning using geographic information systems (GIS).

This study describes the first reported case of ipilimumab-associated thyroid storm and implicates iopanoic acid as an alternative therapy for immune-mediated adverse effects. An 88-year-old woman with metastatic melanoma presented with fatigue, anorexia, decreased functional status, and intermittent diarrhea for several months, shortly after initiation of ipilimumab - a recombinant human monoclonal antibody to the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4). On arrival, she was febrile, tachycardic, and hypertensive with a wide pulse pressure, yet non-toxic appearing. She had diffuse, non-tender thyromegaly. An electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed supraventricular tachycardia. Blood, urine, and stool cultures were collected, and empiric antibiotics were started.

The ability of target tissues to receive cortisol signals has been shown to vary between individuals and over time. Conflicting data exist on whether different target tissues' glucocorticoid (GC) sensitivity is related. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled design, n=19 participants (n=15 men, n=4 women) received an oral dose of 30 mg of cortisol and placebo in randomized order. Memory retrieval of previously learned neutral and emotional words was tested after cortisol or placebo application. Peripheral GC sensitivity was tested by measuring in-vitro stimulated production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in whole blood before and after cortisol vs. placebo application. Cortisol treatment reduced retrieval of neutral and emotional words (marginally significant at p=0.07), and significantly reduced stimulated IL-6 production (p<0.001). Relative suppression of IL-6 production was associated with impairment of memory retrieval of emotional (r=0.48; p=0.039), but not neutral words (r=-0.17; p=0.48). In summary, results show an association of peripheral glucocorticoid sensitivity with emotional, but not neutral, memory retrieval.

The major phosphoproteins in red blood cell (RBC) membranes are spectrin (band 2), bands 3, 2.1, and 4.5, and glycophorin A. At least two protein kinases can be distinguished on the basis of their stimulation by cyclic AMP and salt; they are present both in the membrane and in the cytosol. Analysis of the conflicting data on endogenous membrane-protein phosphorylation in abnormal RBCs indicates a considerable variability of phosphorylation rates which largely depends on the manner of preparation of ghosts and enzyme assay conditions. This variability reflects differences in the partitioning of protein kinases between the membrane and cytosol, the specificity and accessibility of membrane-protein substrates, and reaction kinetics. We select examples of data from several hemolytic anemias to illustrate that precautions are needed to interpret abnormalities of membrane-protein phosphorylation properly; we discuss possible new methodological approaches.', 11997204: 'In cancer patients, cognitive impairment, psychological distress, and anxiety may accompany and aggravate pain. Neuroleptics are frequently used to control these symptoms and may be used to treat pain that has been unresponsive to more conventional approaches. Because of prominent side effects of traditional neuroleptics and conflicting data regarding their analgesic efficacy, their use in the treatment of pain remains controversial. Olanzapine, an atypical neuroleptic, might offer advantages because of its safer side effect profile. It has also been shown to have an independent antinociceptive activity in animals. The use of olanzapine in the management of cancer pain has not been previously described. We prospectively collected the data on 8 cancer patients with severe pain, uncontrolled in spite of aggressive opioid titration, who received olanzapine to treat severe anxiety and mild cognitive impairment. Patients did not meet criteria for delirium and their cognitive impairment was defined as cognitive disorder not otherwise specified (NOS) according to DSM-IV. Patients received 2.5 to 7.5 mg of olanzapine daily. In all patients, opioid requirements had escalated rapidly prior to starting olanzapine. Levels of pain, sedation, and opioid use were measured 2 days before and 2 days after olanzapine was started. Cognitive state was assessed daily. All 8 patients had marked reduction of the daily pain scores. The average daily opioid use decreased significantly in all patients. Cognitive impairment and anxiety resolved within 24 hours of initiating olanzapine. In these 8 patients, decreased pain scores and opioid requirements may have resulted from improvement in cognitive function and the known anxiolytic effect of olanzapine. Other mechanisms may include independent or adjuvant analgesic effects of olanzapine. We conclude that olanzapine may be useful in the treatment of patients with uncontrolled cancer pain associated with cognitive impairment or anxiety. Further studies to evaluate possible analgesic effect of olanzapine are needed.', 2666517: \"This study reviews data on the histogenesis of Kaposi's sarcoma and angiosarcoma derived from clinical features, histology, electron microscopy, enzyme histochemistry, and immunochemistry of both diseases. Their hemorrhagic clinical appearance contrasts the predominantly lymphatic histologic features of vessels in early lesions. Investigations performed to resolve the debate whether these tumors arise from blood vessel or lymphatic endothelium show remarkably similar results for both conditions. Electron microscopy reveals Weibel - Palade bodies in a minority of cases, but features consistent with less well-differentiated blood vessel endothelium may be seen in a greater proportion of tumors. Enzyme histochemistry generally shows absence of adenosine triphosphatase and alkaline phosphatase in tumor cells; a pattern of enzymes similar to that found in normal lymphatic endothelium. Conflicting data arises from the large number of immunohistochemical studies performed on both conditions. Factor VIII-related antigen and Ulex europaeus agglutinin-I have been most frequently employed, but the specificity of these agents for blood vessel endothelium is debatable. Panendothelial markers show consistent labeling of both tumors, but marker studies employing a wide range of monoclonal antibodies specific for blood vessel endothelium have shown occasional positive labeling of tumor cells. A number of studies have claimed absence of labeling with specific blood vessel monoclonal antibodies, but at present no study employing a specific marker for lymphatic endothelium has been reported. Although the demonstration of specific markers for blood vessel endothelium in these tumors has been variable, the data would be compatible with lesions arising from undifferentiated stem cells that proliferate with varying degrees of differentiation toward blood vessel endothelium. An alternative hypothesis for the histogenesis of Kaposi's sarcoma would be one of multicentric hyperplasia containing lymphatic venular anastamoses with elements of both lymphatic and blood vessel endothelium.\", 19781654: 'Conflicting data have accumulated in recent years regarding the incidence of anaerobic bacteraemias. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of bacteraemias due to anaerobic bacteria and evaluate the importance of anaerobic blood cultures in a university hospital in Israel. A retrospective survey which focused on anaerobic blood culture bottles was performed on blood cultures received in our laboratory during the decade from January 1998 to December 2007. Anaerobic-related bacteraemias decreased during that period, whereas a significant increase was observed in Bacteroides species isolated from the blood cultures (from 18% during 1998-2002 to 43% during 2003-2007). Comparison of the medical records of 54 patients with Bacteroides-related bacteraemia during the two end periods (1998-1999 and 2006-2007) revealed a marked increase in complex underlying diseases. Hypertension and diabetes mellitus type II were found in 29% of the patients in 1998-1999 and increased to 43-45% of the patients in 2006-2007. Ischemic heart disease also increased from 14% of the patients in 1998-1999 to 43% in 2006-2007.

Both the diabetic state and insulin sensitivity improve after tumor removal by sub-total pancreatectomy. Impaired glucose tolerance has also been found in the hamster pancreatic cancer model, but conflicting data regarding islet function have been reported. In order to further investigate islet function and secretion during early development of pancreatic cancer, we measured the concentrations of insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) in plasma, pancreatic tissue, and secretin-stimulated pancreatic juice at 12 and 27 weeks after the ductal-cell-specific carcinogen, BOP had been used to induce tumors in Syrian golden hamsters. At 12 weeks after BOP, plasma glucagon levels were significantly increased. An exaggerated plasma-glucose response and concomitant hyperinsulinemia were observed at 27 but not 12 weeks after BOP. Plasma IAPP concentrations, but not glucagon or somatostatin, were elevated at 27 weeks. Tissue concentrations of IAPP were substantially reduced in BOP-treated hamsters at 27 weeks. No differences in hormone concentrations were seen in pancreatic juice from the two groups at either of the two time points investigated. The study showed that islet hormone changes accompany the early development of pancreatic tumors in the hamster pancreatic model. The hormone changes and apparent insulin resistance resemble the metabolic changes found in humans with pancreatic cancer.', 22837272: 'Calcium supplementation has been considered the gold standard therapy for osteoporosis in the general population.

Total pulmonary and specific flows to the atelectatic and contra-lateral lobes were measured by magnetic resonance (MR) before and 30-min post sildenafil (0.2 and 1 mg/kg i.v.) or saline administration.

The data show that 14/14 (100%) of the primary gliomas exhibited mRNA expression for the CCK peptide gene and the B receptor including the U-87 MG cells, whereas, only 2/14 (14%) showed presence of the CCK-A receptor. The presence of CCK receptors together with CCK peptide expression itself suggests presence of an autocrine loop controlling glioma cell growth. In support of this conclusion, a neutralizing antibody against the CCK peptide exhibited a dose dependent inhibition of cell growth whereas, antagonists to CCK caused a dose depend inhibition of exogenous stimulated glioma cell growth in vitro, via the CCK-B receptor which is PKC activated. Assessment of apoptosis and proteasome activity were undertaken and we report that treatment with CCK antagonists decreased proteasome and increased caspase-3 activity. These data indicate that CCK peptide and CCK-B are abundant in human gliomas and they act to stimulate cell growth in an autocrine manner, primarily via the high affinity CCK-B receptor, which was blocked by antagonists to CCK, perhaps via apoptosis.', 15538218: StringElement('We review the current data regarding the impact of various therapeutic alternatives for bladder cancer on health related (HR) quality of life (QOL).', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'OBJECTIVE', u'Label': u'PURPOSE'}), 21150603: StringElement('Only a subset of melanoma patients with advanced disease seems to benefit from immunotherapy.

Constructs where a 'palmitoylable' cysteine residue was progressively moved apart from the myristoylation site to positions 3, 9, 15 and 21 of the protein sequence were made, and these mutants were used to investigate the effect of protein myristoylation on subsequent palmitoylation, subcellular localization, membrane association and caveolin-1 colocalization. In all cases, dual acylation of the GFP chimeras correlated with translocation to Triton X-100-insoluble cholesterol/sphingomyelin-enriched subdomains. Whereas a strong Golgi labeling was observed in all the myristoylated chimeras, association with the plasma membrane was only observed in the dually acylated constructs. Taking into account the conflicting data regarding the existence and specificity of cellular palmitoyl-transferases, our results provide evidence that de-novo-designed sequences can be efficiently S-acylated with palmitic acid in vivo, strongly supporting the hypothesis that non-enzymatic protein palmitoylation can occur within mammalian cells.

This paper contributes to the conflicting data about orange allergens especially those obtained from Citrus Aurantium Sinensis and Citrus Silension (CAS and CS, respectively). Glycoproteins were separated by gel filtration through a Sephadex G-50 column. A definite protein peak was obtained meanwhile several hexoses appeared throughout the fractionation procedure. These molecules have adequate physiochemical properties that make them able to trigger the immunological response (molecular weight, definite chemical composition and glycoprotein content).

Implementation of intensive diabetes management [using insulin pumps or multiple daily injections along with increased frequency of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG)] is expensive although there is a significant reduction in risk of long-term complications and cost (6,7). Although the benefits of optimal glucose control seem clear, the risk of severe hypoglycaemia can be a barrier to achieving this goal (1,4,5). In fact, there is nearly a threefold increase in hypoglycaemia with intensification of treatment in type 1 diabetes (1). This is further complicated by the results of recent clinical trials in type 2 diabetes [ACCORD (8), ADVANCE (9) and VADT (10)]. The results of these trials have shown conflicting outcomes in the intensively treated arm. This paradox has created a need for new technology that will facilitate optimal glucose control by recommending appropriate insulin doses while decreasing the risk of hypoglycaemia. There is no doubt of the role of SMBG in insulin-requiring patients with diabetes as it helps guide patients and the providers to adjust their insulin dose on a daily basis. There is enough data documenting the beneficial effects of increased SMBG in such individuals. However, the story for patients with type 2 diabetes not on insulin therapy is different. There is no consensus on frequency and timing of SMBG and its exact impact on glucose control in non-insulin-requiring individuals with type 2 diabetes is debatable. Part of the reason for this controversy may be related to increasing healthcare cost and thus payers finding ways not to reimburse SMBG, since there is conflicting data and the evidence of SMBG improving long-term outcomes in such individuals is not fully evaluated. The prevalence of diabetes is rising worldwide and there are more than 24 million people, with both type 1 and 2 diabetes (diagnosed and undiagnosed), in the USA (11-15). With a limited number of endocrinologists or diabetes specialists available in the USA, most clinical diabetes care is provided by primary care physicians (16). Tools to help patients adjust their insulin dose at home should help in improving their glucose control. Several technologies such as continuous glucose monitors (sensors) and glucometers (SMBG) are on the market and have been shown to help patients improve glucose excursions, reduce glucose variability, decrease time spent in hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia and improve A1c levels (17-19). Other software available on insulin pumps can also guide patients with adjustment of insulin dose, especially meal-time boluses (20).

Some researchers found impaired implantation in patients with endometriosis, but such a defect in implantation may be caused by either defective embryos or altered endometrium. The observation of a higher rate of arrested embryos in patients with endometriosis compared with disease-free women, and that women with this pathological situation undergoing ovum donation had the same chance of implantation as patients without endometriosis, initially suggested that impaired oocyte/embryo quality may be responsible for reduced implantation. Further investigations on follicular components have also found differences between women with endometriosis and those without the disease. In addition, recent advances on implantation research, mainly on markers of endometrial receptivity, also show features in the eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis that are not found in endometrium of women without the disease, although there is no agreement on this point. In this review, we will focus on infertility-related endometriosis based on our own research and the available literature.', 9111616: StringElement(\"To identify complications of various forms of treatments for prostate cancer and their influence on patients' quality of life with the ultimate goal of suggesting a Quality of Life Questionnaire specific for prostate cancer for further validation.\", attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'OBJECTIVE', u'Label': u'OBJECTIVES'}), 15500299: StringElement('There are conflicting data regarding the socio-economic risk factors for bipolar disorders.

In fact, in PBC patients, the evaluation of portal hypertension needs a direct access to the portal vein in order to measure the real porto-hepatic gradient (PHG), mainly because of a possible pre-sinusoidal component. The severity of portal hypertension, as measured by the PHG using a thin needle, correlated significantly with the long-term survival of PBC patients, but the initial Mayo score remained the best predictor of survival. In addition to the well-known effects on biological parameters, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) treatment has been associated with a stabilization or improvement of portal hypertension but this effect was not observed in all patients: \"responders\" and \"non-responders\" to the UDCA could be identified according to changes in PHG and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels observed 2 years after UDCA therapy and had significantly different long-term survivals. This notion of \"responders\" and \"non-responders\" is new and may well explain the conflicting data found in the literature concerning the effects of UDCA in PBC patients as reported in various clinical trials. These findings are of interest when considering the emerging non-invasive methods aimed at evaluating liver fibrosis, particularly elastography that may prove useful in the indirect assessment of portal hypertension in the near future, therefore avoiding the need for the invasive measurement of the PHG.', 15626316: 'Controlled clinical trials that evaluate the benefits of adjunctive subantimicrobial-dose doxycycline (SDD) with conventional therapy were selected for review.

However, conflicting data were also noted in some studies. Furthermore, it is suggested that the clinical relevance of improvements obtained with SDD beyond those obtained with conventional therapy is debatable. Therefore, clinicians should interpret the data cautiously and differentiate between statistically significant and clinically relevant findings before altering treatment regimens.', 28095501: 'Several studies indicate that the fetal environment plays a significant role in the development of cardiometabolic disease later in life. However, a few studies present conflicting data about the correlation between birth weight and the impairment of cardiac autonomic modulation. The purpose of the present study was to provide further knowledge to elucidate this contradictory relationship. One hundred children aged 5 and 14 years had anthropometric parameters, body composition and blood pressure levels determined. Heart rate variability (HRV) was evaluated by heart rate monitoring, including measurements of both the time and frequency domains. The results showed inverse correlation between the HRV parameters with BMI (RMSSD: P = 0.047; PNN50: P = 0.021; HF: P = 0.041), systolic (RMSSD: P = 0.023; PNN50: P = 0.032) and diastolic (PNN50: P = 0.030) blood pressure levels. On the other hand, there were consistent positive correlations between the HRV parameters and birth weight (RMSSD: P = 0.001; PNN50: P = 0.001; HF: P = 0.002). To determine the effect of birth weight on HRV parameters, we perform multivariate linear regression analysis adjusted for potentially confounding factors (prematurity, gender, age, BMI, physical activity index and SBP levels). These findings were preserved even after adjusting for these confounders. Our results suggested that impaired cardiac autonomic modulation characterized by a reduction in the parasympathetic activity occurs in children with low birth weight. One possible interpretation for these data is that a vagal withdrawal, rather than a sympathetic overactivity, could precede the development of hypertension and other cardiometabolic diseases in children with low birth weight. However, long-term studies should be performed to investigate this possibility.', 16302160: 'D-dimer measurement is commonly included in the diagnostic workup of patients with suspected acute symptomatic deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. As a haemostatic marker, it could be theoretically useful in other thromboembolic disorders, such as acute cerebrovascular events.

In ischemic stroke, mounting evidence suggests a possible role of D-dimer in the acute diagnosis of ischemic stroke subtypes, especially in identifying tromboembolic and lacunar stroke. Its prognostic role still remains unclear, due to conflicting data. D-dimer could be also an useful screening test for excluding CSVT in patients presenting with acute headache, making the presence of cerebral thrombosis unlikely with low plasma levels. In this clinical setting sensitivity and negative predictive value are comparable to that reported in the diagnosis of acute thromboembolic disease.

However, the mechanism by which COX-2 acts in intestinal tumorigenesis remains unresolved because of conflicting data on the cellular localization of COX-2 in intestinal mucosa. Using immunohistochemistry with specific COX-2 antiserum, we have shown that COX-2 protein is localized to interstitial cells at the base of and within adenomas of the small and large intestine of multiple intestinal neoplasia (Min) mice. No COX-2 staining was observed in dysplastic epithelial cells within adenomas or in histologically normal epithelium. Moreover, COX-2 staining was observed in lamina propria cells of histologically normal intestine of Min mice. No staining was demonstrated in wild-type littermates. The rat monoclonal antibody F4/80 was used to show that COX-2-positive cells represented a subset of the macrophage population present in the intestine of Min mice. Localization of COX-2 to macrophages implies a paracrine effect of COX-2 function on epithelial cells in adenomas and also on histologically normal epithelium.

Our previous studies revealed the ability of flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist) to counteract GHB effects on GH secretion. Other hypotheses, including an opioid or serotonergic role of GHB, have been considered. In the present study we investigated GH responses to GHB with or without naloxone (an opiate receptor antagonist) or metergoline (a serotonin receptor antagonist) pretreatment. This study included 10 male healthy volunteers (aged 24.3 +/- 2.9 years) who were submitted to four tests in random order: (A) oral GHB administration; (B) oral GHB and i.v. naloxone administration; (C) oral GHB and oral metergoline administration; and (D) oral placebo and i.v. saline administration. Blood samples for GH assay were collected during the three tests at -15, 0, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 90 min. GHB induced a significant increase in GH plasma levels; naloxone pretreatment did not antagonize GHB action on GH secretion; metergoline significantly decreased GH response to GHB (p < 0.05). No changes were obtained with placebo and saline administration.

Several observations pointed to estrogen as a protective agent that may reduce stroke risk, however, studies have shown conflicting data. There is no strong evidence that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) increases stroke risk. Several studies have shown that HRT may reduce the risk of fatal stroke. Conflicting results have been found for Alzheimer's disease and HRT as well. An association between higher serum concentration of estradiol and decreased risk of cognitive decline has been found in some studies, supporting the hypothesis that estrogen concentration may play a significant role in brain protection. Having in mind results of recent randomized trials, it is suggested that HRT should not be recommended on general basis for the primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular/cerebrovascular diseases or for primary prevention of degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Osteoporosis, cognitive decline and climacteric symptoms that are likely to impact on quality of life, speak in favor for recommendation of HRT use.

The actual circulating molecular forms of these peptides have been the subject of intense investigation particularly since these analytes are measured in clinical assays. Conflicting data has been reported and no firm consensus on the exact nature of the molecular species exists. Because these clinical assays are immunoassay-based, specific epitopes are detected. It is conceivable then that certain epitopes may be masked and therefore unavailable for antibody binding, thus the importance of determining the nature of the circulating molecular forms of these analytes. This situation is an unavoidable Achilles' heel of immunoassays in general. A recombinant O-linked glycosylated form of proBNP has been show to mimic some of the properties of extracted plasma from a heart failure patient. In particular the recombinant and native material co-migrated as diffuse Western-immunostained bands on SDS-PAGE and each band collapsed to an apparent homogeneous band following deglycosylation. Thus, glycosylated-proBNP may be one such circulating form. Here we provide extensive physiochemical characterization for this O-linked protein and compare these results to other described circulating species, non-glycosylated-proBNP and NT-proBNP. It will be shown that glycosylation has no influence on the secondary and quaternary structure of proBNP. In fact, at moderate concentration in benign physiological neutral pH buffer, all three likely circulating species are essentially devoid of major secondary structure, i.e., are intrinsically unstructured proteins (IUPs).

The protein specifically binds human factor H (fH), which down-regulates complement activation and enhances resistance to bactericidal activity. There are conflicting data from studies in human fH transgenic mice on whether binding of human fH to fHbp vaccines decreases immunogenicity, and whether mutant fHbp vaccines with decreased fH binding have enhanced immunogenicity. fHbp can be classified into two sub-families based on sequence divergence and immunologic cross-reactivity. Previous studies of mutant fHbp vaccines with low fH binding were from sub-family B, which account for approximately 60% of serogroup B case isolates. In the present study, we evaluated the immunogenicity of two mutant sub-family A fHbp vaccines containing single substitutions, T221A or D211A, which resulted in 15- or 30-fold lower affinity for human fH, respectively, than the corresponding control wild-type fHbp vaccine. In transgenic mice with high serum concentrations of human fH, both mutant vaccines elicited significantly higher IgG titers and higher serum bactericidal antibody responses than the control fHbp vaccine that bound human fH. Thus, mutations introduced into a sub-family A fHbp antigen to decrease fH binding can increase protective antibody responses in human fH transgenic mice. Collectively the data suggest that mutant fHbp antigens with decreased fH binding will result in superior vaccines in humans.', 16375916: 'This study was initially aimed at developing a PCR-test to differentiate between the pathogenic agent of American foulbrood (Paenibacillus larvae subsp. larvae) and powdery-scale disease (P. larvae subsp. pulvifaciens) of the honeybee. The test was based on the \"insert of clone 9\" (iC9), referring to a cloned 1.9 kB HaeIII fragment that occurs only in the P. larvae subsp. larvae reference strains and possibly correlates with American foulbrood virulence. It was shown that an iC9-based PCR-test discriminates between the BCCM/LMG reference strains of both subspecies. However, the screening of 179 Belgian field strains revealed five isolates that gave no iC9-based amplicon, thus rather resembling to P. larvae subsp. pulvifaciens. In addition, they all produced acid from mannitol, a characteristic previously assigned to the pulvifaciens subspecies. Because the reference strains gave conflicting data, this carbohydrate acidification was not conclusive. Therefore, the exact taxonomic position of the five retained strains was determined by a polyphasic approach using SDS-PAGE, AFLP, and ERIC-based PCR. Four iC9-negative field strains could be identified as P. larvae subsp. larvae; the taxonomic position of the fifth field strain remained ambiguous. The latter was provisionally classified as a subspecies pulvifaciens strain on the basis of SDS-PAGE. The present paper demonstrates the existence of field strains that do not fit well in the subdivision of the species P. larvae into two subspecies.

LPS was extracted from five strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from cystic fibrosis patients by the hot phenol-water method. Chemical characterization included neutral sugars, amino components, and fatty acids. Neutrophils isolated from peripheral blood of healthy individuals were preincubated with different concentrations of LPS. After preincubation, the chemotaxis and chemiluminescence of neutrophils to various stimuli were determined. It was shown that LPS from different strains did not exert the same degree of regulatory effect on neutrophil functions. LPS from strain 174-O:9 exerted the most pronounced effect on neutrophil function seen as inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis toward the chemotactic peptide f-Met-Leu-Phe and zymosan-activated serum (ZAS) and priming of the cells for less than or equal to 8-fold enhancement of chemiluminescence response to f-Met-Leu-Phe. Conversely, LPS from strain 1118-O:3 had no effect on neutrophil chemotaxis and a slight effect on chemiluminescence. The major differences in chemical composition of the LPS from these two strains are in the rhamnose and heptose content of the O side chain and in the alanine content of the core region.

The last decade has seen the emergence of epidemic BI/NAP1/027 and ribotype 078 isolates, associated with the onset of more severe disease and higher rates of morbidity and mortality. However, little is known about these isolates at the molecular level, partly due to difficulties in the genetic manipulation of these strains. Here we report the development of an optimised Tn916-mediated plasmid transfer system, and the use of this system to construct and complement spo0A mutants in a number of different C. difficile strain backgrounds. Spo0A is a global regulator known to control sporulation, but may also be involved in the regulation of potential virulence factors and other phenotypes. Recent studies have failed to elucidate the role of Spo0A in toxin A and toxin B production by C. difficile, with conflicting data published to date. In this study, we aimed to clarify the role of Spo0A in production of the major toxins by C. difficile. Through the construction and complementation of spo0A mutants in two ribotype 027 isolates, we demonstrate that Spo0A acts as a negative regulator of toxin A and toxin B production in this strain background. In addition, spo0A was disrupted and subsequently complemented in strain 630\\u0394erm and, for the first time, in a ribotype 078 isolate, JGS6133. In contrast to the ribotype 027 strains, Spo0A does not appear to regulate toxin production in strain 630\\u0394erm. In strain JGS6133, Spo0A appears to negatively regulate toxin production during early stationary phase, but has little effect on toxin expression during late stationary phase. These data suggest that Spo0A may differentially regulate toxin production in phylogenetically distinct C. difficile strain types. In addition, Spo0A may be involved in regulating some aspects of C. difficile motility.', 9226362: 'Conflicting data exist in the literature regarding the maturity of the human sense of taste during childhood and if gender influences gustatory development.

Although there are conflicting data in the literature, adequate glycemic control with hypoglycemic treatment may be an important element in preventing bone tissue alterations in both type 1 and type 2 DM. Diabetes status is a predictive of future hip and major osteoporosis fractures independently of BMD and FRAX probability.

Although introduction of the single-antigen bead assay has greatly facilitated the immune risk assessment of transplant recipients, it is recognized that not all IgG HLA antibodies detected using this method are equally relevant. In recent years, novel assays (C4d, C1q, C3d) have been developed to interrogate the complement-activating potential of anti-HLA antibodies in vitro, with the hypothesis that complement-fixing antibodies are more immediately injurious to the graft compared with noncomplement-binding antibodies. Although initial studies demonstrated the potential of these assays to risk-stratify antibodies beyond the conventional limited metric of mean fluorescence intensity values, new data from recent analyses challenge some of these early findings. In this review, we examine the technical aspects of these assays and key studies that evaluated the discriminant capacity of these tests to predict numerous outcomes in kidney transplantation. We discuss conflicting data and emerging controversies in the context of recent experimental evidence which offer new insights into the major factors that influence complement activation.

PubMed, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library were searched for randomized controlled trials published in English language. The modified Oxford data grading system was used to access quality of evidence and grade recommendations. The Delphi process was implemented when no data was available. Thirteen randomized, controlled trials were identified, that provided levels 1 to 3 of evidence on various aspects of sacrocolpopexy. Sacrocolpopexy is the preferred procedure for vaginal apical prolapse (Grade A), monofilament polypropylene mesh is the graft of choice and the laparoscopic approach is the preferred technique (Grade B). Grade B recommendation supports the performance of concomitant procedures at the time of sacrocolpopexy. Grade C recommendation suggests either permanent or delayed sutures for securing the mesh to the vagina, permanent tackers or sutures for securing the mesh to the sacral promontory and closing the peritoneum over the mesh.

However, conflicting data exist concerning the outcomes of this disorder. Thus, we reviewed studies that presented evidence for the use of antidepressants and those that examined untreated depression during the gestational period, in terms of clinical and epidemiological aspects.Observational studies have provided reassuring evidence of the safety of antidepressant use during pregnancy. However, due to the reluctance of healthcare providers to prescribe and patients to take medication during the obstetric period, approximately three-quarters of those diagnosed with depression remain untreated. Furthermore, healthcare providers apparently do not recognise the disorder in up to 50% of pregnant women who experience depression. Increased antidepressant dosing during pregnancy may be required to maintain euthymia; however, guidelines for effective dosing levels are absent. Consequently, many patients remain inadequately treated. Substantial maternal and fetal morbidity including substance abuse, functional impairment, increased risk of postnatal depression, and poor pregnancy outcomes have resulted from untreated depression.The consequences of those outcomes are likely to be associated with substantial clinical, social and economic burdens. An incidence-based assessment of the consequences of prenatal depression would be useful in order to: (i) establish the impact on the quality of life of these patients and their families; (ii) assess the associated economic burden on individual families and the healthcare system; and (iii) to provide epidemiological data to enable the provision of suitable management strategies for these patients.', 27748512: 'Increasingly, mitochondria are being recognized as having an important role in fertility.

Although clonal deletion may play an important part in limiting rapidly expanding responses, there are many examples where antigen reactive T cells remain. It has been proposed that tolerance is maintained in this situation either by the induction of anergy or by ongoing suppression. The phenomenon known as immune deviation, where non-inflammatory Th2 responses could suppress Th1 and positively reinforce themselves provided an attractive explanation for infectious tolerance, where tolerant T cells could guide further naive T cells also to tolerance. However, experiments to test this hypothesis in the models of CD4 and CD8 antibody-induced tolerance have given conflicting data, with no clear evidence of Th2 responses in tolerant mice. In this paper we review recent data that IL-4 plays a role in suppression, but that the source of IL-4 may not be the tolerant/suppressor T cell. We also discuss how infectious tolerance can operate on third party antigens if they are linked on the same antigen presenting cell and how CD4+ T cells can suppress CD8+ T-cell responses.

In this study, we used neutrophils isolated from different species to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of PVL in comparison to other staphylococcal cytolytic components. Furthermore, to study the impact of PVL we expressed it heterologously in a non-virulent staphylococcal species and examined pvl-positive and pvl-negative clinical isolates as well as the strain USA300 and its pvl-negative mutant. We demonstrate that PVL induces rapid activation and cell death in human and rabbit neutrophils, but not in murine or simian cells. By contrast, the phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs), a newly identified group of cytolytic staphylococcal components, lack species-specificity. In general, after phagocytosis of bacteria different pvl-positive and pvl-negative staphylococcal strains, expressing a variety of other virulence factors (such as surface proteins), induced cell death in neutrophils, which is most likely associated with the physiological clearing function of these cells. However, the release of PVL by staphylococcal strains caused rapid and premature cell death, which is different from the physiological (and programmed) cell death of neutrophils following phagocytosis and degradation of virulent bacteria. Taken together, our results question the value of infection-models in mice and non-human primates to elucidate the impact of PVL. Our data clearly demonstrate that PVL acts differentially on neutrophils of various species and suggests that PVL has an important cytotoxic role in human neutrophils, which has major implications for the pathogenesis of CA-MRSA infections.', 20694726: StringElement('While the benefits of ascorbic acid (vitamin C, ascorbate) as an essential nutrient are well established, its effects on tumor cells and in tumor treatment are controversial.

Morbidity, mortality, and costs arising from hip fractures have been well documented. Thyroid hormones (TH) are widely prescribed, mainly in the elderly. Some studies (but not all) found a deleterious effect of suppressive TH therapy on bone mass. These conflicting data raised a controversy as to the safety of current prescribing and follow-up habits, which, in turn, raised major health-care issues. To look for a detrimental effect on bone of TH therapy, we performed a meta-analysis (by pooling standardized differences, using a fixed effect model) of all published controlled cross-sectional studies (41, including about 1250 patients) concerning the impact of TH therapy on bone mineral density (BMD). Studies with women receiving estrogen therapy were excluded a priori, as were studies with a high percentage of patients with postoperative hypoparathyroidism, when no separate data were available. We decided to stratify the data according to anatomical site, menopausal status, and suppressive or replacement TH therapy, resulting in 25 meta-analysis on 138 homogeneous subsets of data. The main sources of heterogensity between studies that we could identify were replacement or suppressive TH therapy, menopausal status, site (lumbar spine, femoral neck, Ward's triangle, greater trochanter, midshaft and distal radius, with various percentages of cortical bone), and history of hyperthyroidism, which has recently been found to impair bone mass in a large epidemiological survey. To improve homogeneity, we excluded a posteriori 102 patients from 3 studies, who had a past history of hyperthyroidism and separate BMD data, thus allowing assessment of the TH effect in almost all 25 subset meta-analyses. However, controls were usually not matched with cases for many factors influencing bone mass, such as body weight, age at menarche and at menopause, calcium dietary intake, smoking habits, alcohol intake, exercise, etc. For lumbar spine and hip (as for all other sites), suppressive TH therapy was associated with significant bone loss in postmenopausal women (but not in premenopausal women), whereas, conversely, replacement therapy was associated with bone loss in premenopausal women (spine and hip), but not in postmenopausal women. The detrimental effect of TH appeared more marked on cortical bone than on trabecular bone.

In this review, the authors will highlight some of these new insights for the calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) cyclosporine and tacrolimus and the antimetabolite mycophenolic acid (MPA) and will discuss the possible consequences. For CNIs, important relevant lessons for TDM can be learned from the results of 2 recently published large CNI minimization trials. Furthermore, because acute rejection and drug-related adverse events do occur despite routine application of CNI TDM, alternative approaches to better predict the dose-concentration-response relationship in the individual patient are being explored. Monitoring of CNI concentrations in lymphocytes and other tissues, determination of CNI metabolites, and CNI pharmacogenetics and pharmacodynamics are in their infancy but have the potential to become useful additions to conventional CNI TDM. Although MPA is usually administered at a fixed dose, there is a rationale for MPA TDM, and this is substantiated by the increasing knowledge of the many nongenetic and genetic factors contributing to the interindividual and intraindividual variability in MPA pharmacokinetics. However, recent, large, randomized clinical trials investigating the clinical utility of MPA TDM have reported conflicting data. Therefore, alternative pharmacokinetic (ie, MPA free fraction and metabolites) and pharmacodynamic approaches to better predict drug efficacy and toxicity are being explored.

It is often addressed by reinforcing the importance of a low-salt diet with patients and challenging estimated dry weights. More recently, interest has shifted toward the dialysate sodium prescription as a strategy to improve fluid overload and its adverse sequelae. The availability of high-flux high-efficiency dialysis in conjunction with the need to ensure its tolerability for patients has resulted in an increase in dialysate sodium prescriptions from 120 to\\xa0\\u2265140 mEq/L. However, we are now tackling the unforeseen consequences associated with high dialysate sodium prescriptions. High dialysate sodium concentration is associated with high interdialytic weight gain, a commonly used surrogate for hypervolemia contributing to hypertension.

Currently, the reliability of toxicity data is assessed on the basis of testing information alone (adherence to Good Laboratory Practice (GLP), detailed testing protocols, etc.). Common practice is to take one toxicity data point per compound - usually the one with the apparently highest reliability.

Attention has recently focused on glycoprotein VI (GPVI), a receptor that is expressed on platelets in association with a signaling adapter, the Fc receptor gamma chain (Fc Rgamma). Genetic and pharmacologic loss of GPVI function results in loss of collagen signaling in platelets, but studies to date have failed to demonstrate that GPVI-Fc Rgamma expression is sufficient to confer collagen signaling responses. These results have led to the hypothesis that collagen responses mediated by GPVI-Fc Rgamma may require the collagen-binding integrin alpha2beta1 as a co-receptor, but this model has not been supported by a recent study of mouse platelets lacking alpha2beta1. In the present study we have used a novel anti-GPVI monoclonal antibody to measure the level of GPVI on human platelets and to guide the development of GPVI-expressing cell lines to assess the role of GPVI in mediating platelet collagen responses. GPVI receptor density on human platelets appears tightly regulated, is independent from the level of alpha2beta1 expression, and significantly exceeds that on previously characterized GPVI-expressing RBL-2H3 cells. Using newly generated GPVI-expressing RBL-2H3 cells with receptor densities equivalent to that on human platelets, we demonstrate that GPVI expression confers both adhesive and signaling responses to collagen in a graded fashion that is proportional to the GPVI receptor density. These results resolve some of the conflicting data regarding GPVI-collagen interactions and demonstrate that 1) GPVI-Fc Rgamma expression is sufficient to confer both adhesion and signaling responses to collagen, and 2) GPVI-mediated collagen responses are receptor density-dependent at the receptor levels expressed on human platelets.', 20420817: StringElement('Fetuin-A is a circulating inhibitor of ectopic calcification.

Phenotypical heterogeneity of schizophrenia might explain such discrepancies. For example, negative symptoms are known to reflect severity of illness and to restrain therapeutic response. On this basis, we re-assessed the possible influence of the -1438A/G polymorphism of the 5-HT(2A) receptor gene on the clinical efficacy of atypical antipsychotics with focus on several relevant dimensions. One hundred and sixteen French schizophrenic subjects treated for at least 1 month by atypical antipsychotics were screened for treatment response according to the May and Dencker scale. Gender, age at onset, duration and severity of illness, intensity of negative and positive symptoms at discharge were investigated. The intensity of negative symptoms at discharge was the only variable explaining May and Dencker score (p < 0.001), and was significantly associated with the AA genotype of the -1438A/G polymorphism of the 5-HT(2A) receptor gene (p = 0.03). However, the A allele was not independently associated with refractoriness to atypical antipsychotics. Accordingly, the score reached in the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) appeared as a confounding factor between therapeutic response and the -1438A/G polymorphism of the 5-HT(2A) receptor gene, at least in our sample. This data indicate that negative symptoms are worth being systematically assessed in pharmacogenetic studies aimed at analysing candidate genes in schizophrenia.', 11845849: StringElement('The distinction between primary adenocarcinoma and metastatic breast carcinoma in the lung is important for therapeutic purposes.

This study investigated the effects of several PPARalpha and PPARgamma subtype-specific agonists on the inflammation and hyperalgesia produced by intraplantar carrageenan injection in unanesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats. Intraperitoneal administration of PPARalpha agonists reduced edema in parallel to their potencies determined in vitro. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) inhibited carrageenan-induced edema in a dose-dependent manner, and also reduced thermal hypersensitivity. Furthermore, PFOA produced much more robust effects when administered 0.5-24 hrs before carrageenan, as compared to when it was administered 1.5 hrs after carrageenan. Intraperitoneal administration of similar doses of the PPARgamma agonist rosiglitazone, but not the less potent agonist, troglitazone, reduced edema when administered before but not after carrageenan.

Researchers have proposed that the strong conservation of these sequences may affect the evolution of the surrounding genome, both by repressing rearrangement, and possibly by promoting duplicate gene retention. Conflicting data, however, have made the validity of these propositions unclear. Here, we use a new computational method to identify phylogenetically conserved noncoding elements (PCNEs) in a manner that is not biased by rearrangement and duplication. This method is powerful enough to identify more than a thousand PCNEs that have been conserved between vertebrates and the basal chordate amphioxus. We test 42 of our PCNEs in transgenic zebrafish assays--including examples from vertebrates and amphioxus--and find that the majority are functional enhancers. We find that PCNEs are enriched around genes with ancient synteny conservation, and that this association is strongest for extragenic PCNEs, suggesting that cis-regulatory interdigitation plays a key role in repressing genome rearrangement. Next, we classify mouse and zebrafish genes according to association with PCNEs, synteny conservation, duplication history, and presence in bidirectional promoter pairs, and use these data to cluster gene functions into a series of distinct evolutionary patterns. These results demonstrate that subfunctionalization of conserved cis-regulation has not been the primary determinate of gene duplicate retention in vertebrates. Instead, the data support the gene balance hypothesis, which proposes that duplicate retention has been driven by selection against dosage imbalances in genes with many protein connections.', 12562657: StringElement(\"Conflicting data on the effect of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) on outcome in Hodgkin's disease (HD) might be due to the heterogeneous nature of this disease.

In HIV-positive subjects, immune response worsens with progression of the HIV infection. When vaccination is considered, administration of the vaccine must be performed as early as possible in the course of HIV infection because an HIV-infected patient's response to inactivated vaccines is closely related to HIV infection stage. A minority of subjects have a protective antibody response to vaccination. Consequently, specific antibody titers should be measured after vaccination to ensure immune protection.

Indeed the case for an involvement with any human disease has been questioned with the suggestion that XMRV is a laboratory generated recombinant virus. The fact that not all published positive findings can be easily explained as contamination artefacts coupled with the observation that XMRV may have a sexually transmitted mode of infectivity and can be infectious for primates, where it preferential resides in cells of the reproductive tract, prompted us to look for evidence of XMRV in the cervical cells of a cohort of Kenyan women both with and without pre-existing HIV/HPV infections.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'BACKGROUND', u'Label': u'BACKGROUND'}), 16738536: 'Elevated bone mineral parameters have been associated with mortality in dialysis patients. There are conflicting data about calcium, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and mortality and few data about changes in bone mineral parameters over time. We conducted a prospective cohort study of 1007 incident hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients. We examined longitudinal changes in bone mineral parameters and whether their associations with mortality were independent of time on dialysis, inflammation, and comorbidity. Serum calcium, phosphate, and calcium-phosphate product (CaP) increased in these patients between baseline and 6 months (P<0.001) and then remained stable. Serum PTH decreased over the first year (P<0.001). In Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for inflammation, comorbidity, and other confounders, the highest quartile of phosphate was associated with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.57 (1.07-2.30) using both baseline and time-dependent values. The highest quartiles of calcium, CaP, and PTH were associated with mortality in time-dependent models but not in those using baseline values. The lowest quartile of PTH was associated with an HR of 0.65 (0.44-0.98) in the time-dependent model with 6-month lag analysis. We conclude that high levels of phosphate both at baseline and over follow-up are associated with mortality in incident dialysis patients. High levels of calcium, CaP, and PTH are associated with mortality immediately preceding an event.

We attempted to resolve this controversy by studying the effects of two different statins, rosuvastatin and simvastatin, in two different assay systems. In the matrigel angiogenesis assay, both statins enhanced tube formation by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs, p<0.01 vs. control). In the ex vivo mouse aortic ring sprouting assay, both statins virtually abolished new vessel formation (p<0.01). As a basic difference between the two models of angiogenesis is dispersed state of endothelial cells vs. compact monolayer, we analyzed influence of statins on endothelial junction proteins. RT-PCR analysis and cytoimmunostaining of HUVECs treated with simvastatin revealed increased expression of VE-cadherin (p<0.05). The blockade of VE-cadherin with a specific antibody reversed simvastatin-induced tube formation (p<0.002). These data suggest that statins through VE-cadherin stimulation modulate cell-cell adhesion and diminish the ability of cells to proliferate and migrate. The observations of reduced angiogenesis in the intact vessel may relate to anti-atherosclerotic and anti-cancer effects of statins, and provide a feasible explanation for conflicting data under different experimental conditions.', 26732899: StringElement('This systematic literature review aimed at examining the validity and applicability in everyday clinical rehabilitation practise of methods for the assessment of back muscle fatiguability in patients with chronic non-specific low back pain (CNSLBP).', attributes={u'Label': u'PURPOSE'}), 17514734: StringElement('Asparaginase (ASNase) is an essential component of most treatment protocols for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

UBQLN proteins have three functional domains: N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain (UBL), C-terminal ubiquitin-associated domain (UBA), and STI chaperone-like regions in the middle. Alterations in UBQLN1 gene have been detected in a variety of disorders ranging from Alzheimer's disease to cancer. UBQLN1 has been largely studied in neurodegenerative disorders in the context of protein quality control. Several studies have hypothesized that the UBA domain of UBQLN1 binds to poly-ubiquitin chains of substrate and shuttles it to the proteasome via its UBL domain for degradation. UBQLN1 either facilitates degradation (Ataxin3, EPS15) or stabilizes (PSEN1/2, BCLb) substrates it binds to. The signal that determines this fate is unknown and there is conflicting data to support the existing working model of UBQLN1. Using BCLb as a model substrate, we characterized UBQLN1-substrate interaction. We identified the first two STI domains of UBQLN1 as critical for binding to BCLb. Interaction of UBQLN1 with BCLb is independent of ubiquitination of BCLb, but interaction with ubiquitin via UBA domain is required for stabilization of BCLb. Similarly, we showed that UBQLN1 interacts with IGF1R and ESYT2 through the STI domains and stabilizes these proteins through its UBA domain. Interactions that are not dependent on STI domains, for example, UBL mediated interaction with PSMD4 and BAG6, do not appear to be stabilized by UBQLN1. We conclude that fate of substrates that UBQLN1 associates with, is interaction domain specific. J. Cell.

The mechanisms underpinning this effect have been investigated extensively, with the focus on a reduction in platelet adhesiveness and a lowering of plasma concentrations of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol. Possible effects on fibrinolysis have received less attention and produced conflicting data. The present study evaluates such effects under chemically restricted conditions in vitro, in a system that, based on studies with haemostatically active drugs of known mechanisms, appears to have some relevance to the in vivo situation. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)--one of the major constituents of fish oil--produced a statistically significant (P < 0.05) enhancement of fibrinolysis, when added before formation of the fibrin clot, but generally had the reverse effect when added afterwards. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)--the other major constituent of fish oil--had a dramatic inhibitory effect on clot formation, when added prior to clot formation, and inhibited lysis when added after the clot was formed. Maxepa (Seven Seas Ltd.)--a concentrate of EPA and DHA, and the pharmaceutical equivalent of fish oils--did not influence fibrinolysis, when added prior to clot formation. When added after the clot had formed, however, it produced significant (P < 0.05) and dose-dependent effects that varied from enhancement to inhibition. Similarly, both high-density lipoprotein (HDL)- and LDL-cholesterol, when added after clot formation, produced significant (P < 0.05) concentration-dependent effects that varied from enhancement of fibrinolysis (at the lower concentrations tested) to inhibition at higher concentrations. Our findings suggest that the effects of fish oil and lipids are more complex than simple enhancement or inhibition of fibrinolysis. Rather, the benefits may depend both on their concentration and whether they are present before or after the fibrin clots are formed.', 16750634: 'A combination of tacrolimus (TAC) and sirolimus (SIR) has recently proved to be a very effective immunosuppressive regimen in organ transplantation. In pediatric transplant recipients, co-administration of these two drugs has been shown to result in a significant decrease of exposure to TAC, whereas conflicting data have been obtained regarding this pharmacokinetic interaction in adults. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of SIR on TAC pharmacokinetics in adult transplant recipients. Sixteen adult patients (mean age 38+/-8 years), who had been on standard TAC plus low-dose SIR immunosuppressive treatment for 6 months after renal transplantation, were enrolled for a TAC pharmacokinetic study before and 15 days after discontinuing SIR. Eight patients had received SIR 0.5 mg day(-1) and eight patients 2 mg day(-1). TAC doses remained the same in all patients after SIR withdrawal. After discontinuing SIR, statistically significant, dose-dependent increases were observed in area under the curve (AUC), peak (C(max)) and trough (C(min)) TAC concentrations (+15-20% and +27-32%, after discontinuing the 0.5 and the 2 mg day(-1) doses, respectively). Proportional decreases were consistently observed in apparent oral clearance (-13% and -23%). Very good correlations were found between TAC AUC and C(min), both before and after SIR withdrawal (R(2)=0.94, P<0.0001 and R(2)=0.97, P<0.0001, respectively). Our findings clearly demonstrate that the SIR-induced reduction in TAC exposure also takes place in adults and is, therefore, a general, age-independent phenomenon.

Scarce and conflicting data exist about the effects of diuretics and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists on the fibrinolytic system, whereas ACE inhibitors have generally been reported to improve the fibrinolytic balance by decreasing plasma PAI-1 levels, calcium channel antagonists have been shown to increase tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) activity, and angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor antagonists seem to exert neutral effects. beta-Adrenoceptor antagonists, calcium channel antagonists, and AT(1)-receptor antagonists have been reported to exert anti-aggregatory effects on platelets, while contrasting data exist about the influence of ACE inhibitors.

Opioids are the most commonly used analgesics in children and adults to treat perioperative pain. Narrow therapeutic index and a large interpatient variability in response to opioids are clinically significant, with inadequate pain relief at one end of the spectrum and serious side effects, such as respiratory depression and excessive sedation due to relative overdosing, at the other end. Personalizing analgesia during the perioperative period attempts to maximize pain relief while minimizing adverse events from therapy. While various factors influence response to treatment among surgical patients, age, sex, race and pharmacogenetic differences appear to play major roles in predicting outcome. Genetic factors include a subset of genes that modulate the proteins involved in pain perception, pain pathway, analgesic metabolism (pharmacokinetics), transport and receptor signaling (pharmacodynamics). While results from adult genetic studies can provide direction for pediatric studies, they have limited direct applicability, as children's genetic predispositions to analgesic response may be influenced by developmental and behavioral components, altered sensitivity to analgesics and variation in gene-expression patterns. We have reviewed the available evidence on improving and personalizing pain management with opioids and the significance of individualizing analgesia, in order to maximize analgesic effect with minimal adverse effects with opioids. While the early evidence on individual genotype associations with pain, analgesia and opioid adverse outcome are promising, the large amount of conflicting data in the literature suggests that there is a need for larger and more robust studies with appropriate population stratification and consideration of nongenetic and other genetic risk factors. Although the clinical evidence and the prospect of being able to provide point-of-care genotyping to enable clinicians to deliver personalized analgesia for individual patients is still not available, positioning our research to identify all possible major genetic and nongenetic risk factors of an individual patient, advancing less expensive point-of-care genotyping technology and developing easy-to-use personalized clinical decision algorithms will help us to improve current clinical and economic outcomes associated with pain and opioid pain management.\", 10092812: 'Resistance to the mouse pneumonitis (MoPn) strain of Chlamydia trachomatis has been mapped to MHC class II-restricted, IL-12-dependent CD4+ T cells that secrete a type 1 profile of proinflammatory cytokines, which includes IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. The relative contribution of IFN-gamma is controversial, however, due to variation in results presented by different laboratories. To determine whether C. trachomatis strain differences contributed to this apparent conflict, the relative resistance of IFN-gamma-deficient mice to murine and human strains of C. trachomatis was compared. All human serovars were much more sensitive to the direct inhibitory actions of IFN-gamma than the MoPn strain. Furthermore, genital clearance of human serovar D in the C57BL/6 mouse was mediated by class II-independent mechanisms that probably involved local production of IFN-gamma by cells of the innate immune system. TNF-alpha also contributed indirectly to host resistance against all strains tested. The differential susceptibility of distinct C. trachomatis strains to effector cytokines such as IFN-gamma could not have been predicted by interstrain biologic variation or by the profile of cytokines stimulated during infection. These findings indicate that strain variation should be considered in situations where related isolates of a given parasite produce conflicting data in models of infection and immunity.

Research focusing on a possible contribution of ELF-EMF to cell injury and to the development of neurodegenerative disorders is characterized by conflicting data from epidemiological and animal studies. Due to lack of a direct link between neurodegenerative processes and ELF-EMF exposure, our goal was to investigate if ELF-EMF exposure may represent a possible risk factor.

In SH-SY5Y-exposed cells we observed increased intracellular 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid/5-hydroxytryptamine ratio reflecting the rate of transmitter synthesis, catabolism and release, while matrix metalloproteinases that play critical roles in neuronal cell death were not significantly altered. The results presented here indicate that changes caused by short (1h-3h) and sub-chronic (48 h) exposure to 50Hz/1mT ELF-EMF in SH-SY5Y cells are minor in comparison to the neuronal cell damage expected to underlie neurodegeneration or cognitive impairment.

Ectopic expression of subunits of NF-\\u03baB (p50 or p65/RelA) significantly increased luciferase activity in HeLa, 293, 293T and 3T3 cells, indicating that the let-7a-3/let-7b promoter is highly responsive to NF-\\u03baB. Mutation of a putative NF-\\u03baB binding site at bp -833 reduced basal promoter activity and decreased promoter activity in the presence of p50 or p65 overexpression. Mutation of a second putative binding site, at bp -947 also decreased promoter activity basally and in response to p65 induction, indicating that both sites contribute to NF-\\u03baB responsiveness. While the levels of the endogenous primary let-7a and let-7b transcript were induced in response to NF-\\u03baB overexpression in 293T cells, the levels of fully processed, mature let-7a and let-7b miRNAs did not increase. Instead, levels of Lin-28B, a protein that blocks let-7 maturation, were induced by NF-\\u03baB. Increased Lin-28B levels could contribute to the lack of an increase in mature let-7a and let-7b. Our results suggest that the final biological outcome of NF-\\u03baB activation on let-7 expression may vary depending upon the cellular context. We discuss our results in the context of NF-\\u03baB activity in repressing self-renewal and promoting differentiation.', 20472094: 'There are conflicting data regarding the effect of culturing time of human peripheral blood lymphocytes on the yield of chromosomal aberrations induced by sparsely ionising radiation in the G0 phase of the cell cycle. While some authors find that the yield of aberrations does not change with time, others find increased frequencies of aberrations with harvesting time. The reasons for the conflicting results are not known, but the majority of studies were performed with lymphocytes of a single donor collected at one time point. We performed a study to verify if individual variability could be a confounding factor. As a positive control, lymphocytes were also exposed to high LET radiation (neutrons and alpha-rays), where an effect of harvesting time on the level of damage is expected to be seen. Blood was drawn from a total of 8 donors at two time points and exposed to X-rays, 6 MeV neutrons or alpha particles generated by an Am-241 source. Whole blood cultures were set up and micronuclei (Mn) were scored in binucleated cells harvested after 72, 96 and 120 h of culture time. The results show that in lymphocytes exposed to X-rays, the frequency of Mn was generally not influenced by the culture time while for both neutrons and alpha particles consistently increased micronucleus frequencies with culture time were detected. Some individual variability was detected and the conflicting results regarding the relationship between the yield of cytogenetic damage and lymphocyte culture time can, at least partly, be due to this variability.', 8882464: 'Since endothelium-dependent relaxation of cerebral vessels was first identified in 1980, the pivotal role of the endothelium has become evident not only in dilator responses but also in constrictor responses to various kinds of stimulation. Involvement of endothelium-derived relaxing factors (EDRFs) as well as endothelium-derived contracting factors (EDCFs) has been postulated in such vascular responses. In 1987, one of the EDRFs was determined to be nitric oxide (NO), a simple and very labile molecule, whereas endothelin composed of 21 amino acid residues was identified as one of the EDCFs in 1988. Since 1990, numerous studies which exclusively employed L-arginine analogues as specific NO synthase (NOS) inhibitors, have been undertaken to examine the role of NO in the regulation of the cerebral circulation. However, some conflicting data have emerged. The few points of consensus among the researchers may be summarized as follows: (1) NO, probably produced in the endothelium, plays an important role in the maintenance of the basal cerebral blood flow, (2) NO is not directly involved in hypoxic vasodilation, and (3) NO mediates a functional coupling of metabolism and cerebral blood flow in certain types of neural activation. Hypercapnic vasodilation and autoregulatory responses are still the main topics providing conflicting data with substantial areas of controversy. Besides ensuring appropriate experimental protocols, future studies require the precise monitoring of the degree and cellular specificity (endothelium, perivascular nerve fibers, neurons, etc.) of NOS inhibition in order to obtain concrete and reliable experimental data.', 16197921: StringElement('Conflicting data exist regarding the presence of magnesium (Mg) deficiency and the therapeutic efficacy of Mg in premenstrual syndrome or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'BACKGROUND', u'Label': u'BACKGROUND'}), 11092259: StringElement('Conflicting data have been reported concerning the modification of cytochrome P450 expression in the regenerating liver.

It accounts for 10% of all haematological malignant diseases and 1% of all malignancies. The median age of patients at the time of the diagnosis is 70 years. The characteristic clinical features of MM are bone marrow failure, susceptibility to infections, bone pain, pathological bone fractures, hypercalcaemia, and renal failure. Though MM is currently incurable, the important progress in chemotherapy has resulted in an improvement in survival from a median of 7 months in the 1950-ies to about 3 years today. Advances in the diagnosis and in supportive treatment of infections, hypercalcaemia, and renal failure also contributed to the prolongation of survival. For decades, the gold standard of treatment had been oral melphalan alone or in combination with prednisolone. Combination chemotherapy has not improved overall survival (OS), but these regimens have led to the prolongation of event-free survival (EFS) and also to a better quality of life. High-dose chemotherapy with haemopoietic stem cell rescue resulted in a great improvement in EFS as well as OS. For those very few who have an HLA-compatible donor and are under 55, allogeneic bone marrow transplantation offers the best hope of survival but comes at a greatly increased risk of toxicity. There are conflicting data in the literature concerning the role of interferon-alpha; it seems to be able to prolong the duration of the plateau phase. Current treatment is moving towards an approach using sequential therapy. This involves induction therapy proceeding to high-dose chemotherapy with some form of stem-cell rescue. Bisphosphonates reduce hypercalcaemia, bone pain and can inhibit bone destruction. They also possess a direct antitumor activity.

Because GHD associated with acromegaly and Cushing's syndrome may yield adverse consequences on similar target systems, the final outcomes of some complications of both acromegaly and Cushing's syndrome may be further affected by the occurrence of GHD. It is still largely unknown, however, whether GHD in patients with post-acromegaly or active Cushing's syndrome (e.g. pharmacologic glucocorticoid treatment) may benefit from GH replacement.

Clinical trials have shown its efficacy in lowering HbAlc significantly especially in adults with type 1 diabetes and those with HbAlc >8%. Improvement is sustained for at least one year. Conflicting data exist for children. Most recent studies agree that the nearly daily use of CGMS is accompanied by significant lowering of HbA1c independent of age. However, the randomized clinical trials have shown that the use of CGMS does not reduce significantly the number of severe hypoglycemic episodes as it is expected, but recent data indicate that it reduces the time spent in hypoglycemia. Accuracy remains a key issue for CGMS, particularly in children and adolescents who may have increased variability of blood glucose. CGMS cost is another barrier to the everyday use since reimbursement of CGM is limited to a few countries only.

These studies allow some important conclusions. Data from retrospective studies and meta-analyses indicate that the use of platinum-based two-drug combinations in selected, fit elderly patients may produce response rates, survival, and toxicity comparable to those in younger patients. This excludes a per se inferior effectiveness of chemotherapy in the population of elderly patients with NSCLC. A number of more recently introduced agents with a favourable toxicity profile have significantly increased treatment options. Single- agent therapy with vinorelbine, when compared to best supportive care, has been shown to give a statistically significant survival benefit and improve quality of life. Conflicting data from phase II/III trials in elderly patients with NSCLC exist regarding a potential benefit of combination chemotherapy over single-agent treatment in the total cohort of elderly patients, including those with comorbidities or declining functional reserve.

Causative factors are divided in antibody mediated TRALI and non-antibody mediated TRALI. Antibody mediated TRALI is caused by passive transfusion of cognate antibodies and non-antibody mediated TRALI is caused by transfusion of aged cellular blood products. This review focuses on mechanisms in non-antibody mediated TRALI which includes soluble mediators accumulating during storage of red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets (PLTs), as well as changes in morphology and function of aged PLTs and RBCs. These mediators cause TRALI in two-hit animal models and have been implicated in TRALI onset in clinical studies. Pre-clinical studies show a clear relation between TRALI and increased storage time of cellular blood products. Observational clinical studies however report conflicting data. Knowledge of pathophysiological mechanisms of TRALI is necessary to improve storage conditions of blood products, develop prevention strategies and develop a therapy for TRALI.', 21330220: 'Compared with medical therapy, percutaneous coronary intervention has been shown to reduce the rates of death and recurrent ischemia in patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes (ACS).

Prevention of the first acquisition of Streptococcus pneumoniae through the use of vaccines represents an effective method to reduce the burden of the disease in both children and adults. Two vaccines are currently available in adults: a pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) that includes 23 purified capsular polysaccharide antigens and a pneumococcal protein-conjugate vaccine (PCV13) that includes capsular polysaccharide antigens covalently linked to a non-toxic protein. The PPV23 induces a humoral immune response and since it has been licensed has been the subject of debates and controversies. Numerous studies and meta-analyses have shown that PPV23 protects against invasive pneumococcal disease, although there are conflicting data regarding its efficacy for the prevention of pneumonia. Vaccination with PCV13 stimulates good antibody responses as well as mucosal immunity and suppresses colonization. A conjugate vaccine can be expected to have benefits over a polysaccharide vaccine because of the characteristics of a T-cell-dependent response in terms of affinity, maturation of antibodies with repeated exposure, induction of immunological memory and long-lasting immunity. PCV13 has demonstrated all of these characteristics in children and fundamental differences in adults are not expected. The efficacy in adults is currently being investigated and results will be available soon.', 11385138: 'There are conflicting data from human studies regarding the ability of exogenous glucocorticoids to stimulate maturation of the small intestine. The discrepancies may relate to differences in hormone doses and age administered. To explore this general concept, we have used a mouse model to determine intestinal responsiveness to dexamethasone (DEX) at various times during development. We first showed that trehalase mRNA is a sensitive marker of intestinal maturation in the mouse; being undetectable (by Northern blotting) in the prenatal period, expressed at low levels during the first 2 postnatal weeks and then displaying a marked increase in the 3rd postnatal week. DEX was unable to elicit detectable trehalase mRNA in fetal mice, but caused significant increases in the postnatal period. The use of a range of DEX doses (0.0125-2.5 nmol/g BW per day) established that there is no change in sensitivity between the 1st and 2nd postnatal weeks, but there is a significant increase in maximal responsiveness of trehalase mRNA to the hormone. Similar results were obtained when sucrase-isomaltase mRNA was assayed in the same animals. Thus, in this rodent model, there appears to be at least three phases in the DEX responsiveness of the developing intestine: an early phase (prenatal) when DEX is unable to elicit intestinal maturation; then a phase (first postnatal week) of modest responsiveness; then a transition to increased responsiveness. These findings point to the need for careful attention to dose and age in analyses of glucocorticoid effects in human infants.', 24973386: \"Sexual dimorphism is a well-established phenomenon, but its degree varies tremendously among species. Since the early days of Einthoven's development of the three-lead galvanometer ECG, we have known there are marked differences in QT intervals of men and women. It required over a century to appreciate the profound implications of sex-based electrophysiological differences in QT interval on the panoply of sex differences with respect to arrhythmia risk, drug sensitivity, and treatment modalities. Little is known about the fundamental mechanism responsible for sex differences in electrical substrate of the human heart, in large part due to the lack of tissue availability. Animal models are an important research tool, but species differences in the sexual dimorphism of the QT interval, the ionic currents underlying the cardiac repolarization, and effects of sex steroids make it difficult to interpolate animal to human sex differences. In addition, in some species, different strains of the same animal model yield conflicting data. Each model has its strengths, such as ease of genetic manipulation in mice or size in dogs. However, many animals do not reproduce the sexual dimorphism of QT seen in humans. To match sex linked prolongation of QT interval and arrhythmogenic phenotype, the current data suggest that the rabbit may be best suited to provide insight into sex differences in humans. In the future, emerging technologies such as induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiac myocyte systems may offer the opportunity to study sex differences in a controlled hormonal situation in the context of a sex specific human model system.\", 18460981: 'There are conflicting data about chemoresistance and prognosis in ovarian clear cell carcinoma (CCC). This could be due to significant interobserver variation in the diagnosis of CCC and other ovarian surface epithelial tumors containing clear cells. Thirty-two cases previously diagnosed as CCC, high-grade ovarian serous carcinoma (SC), and mixed surface epithelial carcinoma (SEC) with clear cell and serous components were reviewed by 4 gynecologic pathologists blinded to the original diagnoses. Interobserver reproducibility was evaluated. Each case was also assessed using immunohistochemical markers Wilm tumor 1, estrogen receptor, and p53. The interobserver reproducibility was greatest for pure CCC (kappa of 0.82), and lowest for the mixed SEC (kappa of 0.32). Moderate agreement was seen in the pure SC category (kappa of 0.59). All pure SC and most mixed SEC presented as stage III or IV diseases. Most pure CCC presented as stage I or II diseases. Immunoreactivities of the mixed SECs were similar to those of pure SC, but significantly different from those of pure CCC for Wilm tumor 1 (P=0.0011 for both components), estrogen receptor (P=0.0003 for clear cell component, P=0.0001 for serous component), and p53 (P=0.0062 for both components). The serous and clear cell components of mixed SEC showed higher mitotic rates than pure CCC (P=0.004 and P=0.023, respectively), but the mitotic rate of pure SC was similar to the mixed SEC. We conclude that (1) pure CCC is reproducibly diagnosed. (2) The diagnosis of mixed ovarian SEC with clear cell component is not reproducible. (3) Mixed SEC with clear cell and serous components show similar stage, mitotic activities, and immunoreactivities to those of pure SC, and likely represent SC with clear cell changes.', 28236087: 'There is little evidence for most of the medications currently used to treat functional abdominal pain disorders (FAPDs) in children. Not only are there very few clinical trials, but also most have significant variability in the methods used and outcomes measured. Thus, the decision on the most appropriate pharmacological treatment is frequently based on adult studies or empirical data. In children, peppermint oil, trimebutine, and drotaverine have shown significant benefit compared with placebo, each of them in a single randomized clinical trial. A small study found that cyproheptadine was beneficial in the treatment of FAPDs in children. There are conflicting data regarding amitriptyline. While one small study found a significant benefit in quality of life compared with placebo, a large multicenter study found no benefit compared with placebo.

One of the difficulties encountered in the identification of M-Ag derived from the conflicting data obtained in the attempts to solubilize active antigenic material from thyroid subcellular fractions. In particular, following detergent treatment, M-Ag could not be detected by complement fixation, while a full recovery of the antigen has been observed using a radioassay technique. In the present investigation, the antigenic activity of Triton X-100 solubilized thyroid microsomes was assessed in parallel by complement fixation and radioassay methods employing the same anti-microsomal antibody (anti-M Ab) preparation for antigen detection. In untreated microsomes antigenic activity was detected by both methods. In contrast, detergent solubilized M-Ag was detected by radioassay, but could not be detected by complement fixation. These data indicate that detergent solubilization diminishes the complement fixing capacity of M-Ag, while the solubilized antigen can still be fully detected by its binding reaction with the autoantibody, and explain the discrepant results obtained in previous studies.', 15831357: 'Angiotensin (Ang) II infusion increases atherosclerosis and leads to the formation of abdominal aortic aneurysms in apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-/-) mice. Conversely, blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) decreases atherosclerosis in this model. However, there are conflicting data in the literature concerning responses to both Ang II infusion and RAS blockade which may depend on age, sex, dose, duration of treatment, and the site at which lesion area was measured. In the present study we examined the effects of Ang II infusion on lesion formation in male ApoE-/- mice both at the aortic sinus and in the descending aorta, starting at different ages, and varying in duration. We also tested the effects of the Ang II receptor antagonist losartan at different doses in both males and females. Blood pressure and plasma renin concentration (PRC) were measured as indicators of the hemodynamic and neurohormonal effects of these treatments. Administration of Ang II increased lesion area much more in the descending aorta than at the aortic sinus. However, spontaneous lesion development at the aortic sinus was much greater than in more distal regions of the aorta. Aneurysms were observed in all treatment groups but were less severe in animals treated from 4 weeks age, possibly because of protective remodeling. Losartan treatment reduced lesion area at the aortic sinus, although differences were only significant in female mice. These findings demonstrate regional and temporal differences in the sensitivity of the aorta to the effects of RAS stimulation and blockade, and may help to explain some of the discrepancies between previous reports from other laboratories.', 22419801: 'There are conflicting data on the relationship between the level of secreted NS1 (sNS1), viremia, and disease severity upon dengue virus (DENV) infection in the clinical setting, and therefore, we examined this relationship in the widely accepted AG129 mouse model.

Using this test, we demonstrated that increased viremia paralleled severe pathologies; however, sNS1 level did not correlate with viremia or severity. Furthermore, among the DENV2 strains that were tested, the level of NS1 secretion did not correspond to virus replication rate in vitro, at the cellular level.

The drug is currently approved for post myocardial infarction and peripheral artery disease indications on top of clopidogrel and/or aspirin. The stroke data after vorapaxar are mixed, dominated with heavy excess of intracranial bleeding risks and slightly worsened second stroke rates, but show less primary ischemic strokes.

However, conflicting data from endemic areas suggest that the parasite may interfere with the induction of effective B-cell responses. To date, the impact of blood-stage parasite exposure on antigen-specific B cells has not been reported following controlled human malaria infection (CHMI). Here we analysed human B-cell responses in a series of Phase I/IIa clinical trials, which include CHMI, using candidate virus-vectored vaccines encoding two blood-stage antigens: merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1) and apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1). Previously vaccinated volunteers show boosting of pre-existing antigen-specific memory B-cell (mBC) responses following CHMI. In contrast, unvaccinated malaria-naive control volunteers developed an mBC response against MSP1 but not AMA1. Serum IgG correlated with the mBC response after booster vaccination but this relationship was less well maintained following CHMI. A significant reduction in peripheral MSP1-specific mBC was observed at the point of diagnosis of blood-stage infection. This was coincident with a reduction in peripheral blood B-cell subsets expressing CXCR3 and elevated serum levels of interferon-\\u03b3 and CXCL9, suggesting migration away from the periphery. These CHMI data confirm that mBC and antibody responses can be induced and boosted by blood-stage parasite exposure, in support of epidemiological studies on low-level parasite exposure.', 7530830: 'The purpose of this study was to evaluate adjuvant drug therapies combined with standard laser excision in the treatment of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. Previous studies have presented conflicting data on the efficacy of various treatments, including interferon and isotretinoin. A retrospective study of 34 patients with moderate to severe papillomatosis who underwent both laser surgery and adjuvant therapy was therefore performed. All patients were treated with interferon. Five interferon failures received isotretinoin, and three with recalcitrant disease received methotrexate. Interferon produced a complete response in 16 patients and partial response in 12 patients. Juvenile-onset disease had a slightly higher response to interferon than adult-onset disease. isotretinoin produced no response in all five patients. Methotrexate demonstrated a marked improvement in both severity of disease and treatment interval in all three patients. Serious side effects were limited to one interferon patient with febrile seizures, which resolved with discontinuation of therapy. We conclude that adjuvant therapy including interferon and methotrexate is clearly of benefit in the treatment of patients with respiratory papillomatosis.

It can regulate killing and gamma interferon secretion by NK cells, as well as T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity. There are conflicting data regarding the mechanism of action of 2B4. In these studies, we attempted to understand better the nature and basis of 2B4 signaling. Our studies showed that engagement of 2B4 on NK cells triggered a tyrosine phosphorylation signal implicating 2B4, Vav-1, and, to a lesser extent, SHIP-1 and c-Cbl. Structure-function analyses demonstrated that this response was defined by a series of tyrosine-based motifs in the cytoplasmic region of 2B4 and was not influenced by the extracellular or transmembrane segment of 2B4. In addition, the 2B4-induced signal was absolutely dependent on coexpression of SAP, a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing adaptor associating with SLAM-related receptors and mutated in X-linked lymphoproliferative disease. It was also observed that 2B4 was detectably associated with the Src-related protein tyrosine kinase FynT in an immortalized NK cell line. Mutation of arginine 78 of SAP, a residue critical for binding of SAP to FynT, eliminated 2B4-mediated protein tyrosine phosphorylation, implying that SAP promotes 2B4 signaling most probably by recruiting FynT. Finally, despite the similarities in the signaling modalities of 2B4 and its relative SLAM, the natures of the tyrosine phosphorylation signals induced by these two receptors were found to be different. These differences were not caused by variations in the extent of binding to SAP but rather were dictated by the tyrosine-based sequences in the cytoplasmic domain of the receptors. Taken together, these data lead to a better understanding of 2B4 signaling. Furthermore, they provide firm evidence that the signals transduced by the various SLAM-related receptors are unique and that the specificity of these signals is defined by the distinctive arrays of intracytoplasmic tyrosines in the receptors.', 762202: 'Cellular resistance to the cytotoxic purine analogues 8-azaguanine (AG) and 6-thioguanine (TG) is usually mediated by a mutation leading to the loss or reduction in hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) activity. However, stable AG-resistant variants have often been shown to contain wild-type levels of HPRT, while cellular resistance to TG is always accompanied by a profound deficiency in HPRT activity. Such AG-resistant, HPRT-positive cells are still sensitive to TG. To investigate the basis of this differential sensitivity, we examined the inhibition of the HPRT activity by AG and TG in whole cells, in cell-free extracts, and with purified mouse HPRT. In addition, the relative incorporation and utilization of AG and TG by L929 cells were determined under a variety of culture conditions. Results show that, compared to TG, AG is generally a very poor substrate for HPRT. Incorporation of radioactive AG by HPRT-positive cells was extremely sensitive to the free purine concentrations in the medium, so that under the usual culture conditions employing undialyzed serum, cellular uptake and utilization was minimal even when relatively high levels of AG were present. In contrast, the incorporation of radioactive TG was comparable to that of a natural substrate, hypoxanthine. The results indicate that the differential cellular sensitivity to AG and TG is due to the difference between these two guanine analogues as substrates of HPRT. Additional data indicate also that cellular resistance to TG is mediated exclusively by HPRT deficiency, but resistance to very high levels of AG may result through at least two other mechanisms not involving HPRT deficiency. These observations may help resolve some of the conflicting data in the literature, and demonstrate that TG is a better selective agent for the HPRT-deficient phenotype.', 26118491: StringElement('Electroencephalography (EEG) is an essential tool in the diagnosis of epilepsy.

HNPCC patients, in particular, are often reported to have a better survival. We examined 2,340 colorectal-cancer patients treated in our Institution: 144 HNPCC patients (Amsterdam Criteria), 161 FAP patients and 2,035 patients with sporadic cancer. Data on hereditary-cancer patients treated between 1980 and 1995 was collected in a registry. The 2,035 sporadic colorectal-cancer patients (controls) included all new cases treated in the Department of Gastrointestinal-Tract Surgery during the same period. Observed survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cumulative survival probability was estimated at 5 years within each group and stratified by various clinical and pathological variables. The age distribution at diagnosis of sporadic patients was significantly higher than that of FAP and HNPCC patients (median 60 years vs. 43 and 49 years; p < 0.0001). In the HNPCC group, 40% had a right cancer location, vs. 14% in the FAP group and 13% in the sporadic-cancer group. In the sporadic group, 51% were early-stage cancers (Dukes A or B) vs. 48.4% and 52.1% in the FAP and HNPCC groups respectively. In the HNPCC, FAP and sporadic-cancer groups, the 5-year cumulative survival rate was 56.9%, 54.4% and 50.6% respectively. Survival analysis by the Cox proportional-hazards method revealed no substantial survival advantage for HNPCC and FAP patients compared with the sporadic group, after adjustment for age, gender, stage and tumor location. The hazard ratio for HNPCC was 1.01 (95% CI 0.72-1.39) and 1.27 (95% CI 0.95-1.7) for FAP patients compared with the sporadic-colorectal-cancer group.', 23585122: u'Hydrogen sulphide (H2S) is one of three gaseous signaling molecules after nitric oxide and carbon monoxide. Various H2S donor compounds have been synthesized to study its physiological function. Among these compounds sodium hydrosulphide (NaHS), a donor of releasing H2S rapidly have shown to be protective in certain neuronal cell line but several in vivo studies have generated conflicting data. Furthermore several slow releasing H2S donors have been shown to have positive effects on cells in culture. The intracellular concentration of H2S and hence its rate of production may be a factor in keeping the balance between its neuroprotective and toxic effects. The present study was undertaken to deduce how a rapid releasing H2S donor (NaHS) as opposed to a slow releasing donor (ADTOH), affect oxidative stress related intracellular components and survival of RGC-5 cells. It was concluded that when RGC-5 cells are exposed to the toxic effects of glutamate in combination with buthionine sulfoxime (Glu/BSO), ADTOH was more efficacious in inhibiting apoptosis, scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS), stimulation of glutathione (GSH) and gluthathione-S-transferase (GST). Western blot and qPCR analysis showed ADTOH increased the levels of Nrf2, HO-1, PKC\\u03b1, p-Akt, Bcl-2 and XIAP but caused a decrease of Nf\\u03ba\\u03b2 and xCT greater than NaHS. This study is first to compare the efficacy of two H2S donor drugs as potential neuroprotectants and demonstrate that slow regulated release of H2S to cell culture can be more beneficial in inhibiting oxidative stress induced cell death.', 17889635: StringElement(\"Considering the increasing tendency towards cosmetic rhinoplasty and conflicting data in this regard, and in order to assess the role of mental health and self-concept in rhinoplasty patients, this study was performed at Taleghani Hospital in Tehran during 2003-2004. This was a case-control study of 52 rhinoplasty patients admitted to the ear, nose and throat (ENT) and oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS) wards of Taleghani Hospital and 52 control subjects who were matched according to age, gender, marital status, economic state, education level and occupation with the former group. Data were gathered using the 'General Health Questionnaire-28' and 'Roger's Self-Concept questionnaire', and then were analysed by t, Pearson, Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests. The comparison of mental health (including the total score and the scores of subscales for depression, anxiety, somatic complaints, and social incompatibility) and self-concept between rhinoplasty patients and the control group has not been shown to be statistically different. It seems that there is no relationship between mental health, self-concept and the decision to undergo rhinoplasty.

Different pathologies might result in acute sensorineural hearing loss, such as sudden hearing loss, exposure to medications/drugs or loud sound.

Molecular events and signaling pathways which underlie damage to these structures have been discovered. Areas covered: This paper summarizes current research efforts involved in investigating the molecular mechanisms involved in acute sensorineural hearing loss. Expert opinion: While progress has been made in unraveling basic mechanisms involved in acute sensorineural hearing loss, it is difficult to translate basic concepts to the clinic. There are often conflicting data in animal and human studies on the effect of a given intervention. There is also a lack of high quality clinical trials (double blind, placebo controlled and high powered).

We review the current status and challenges of laparoscopy in ventral hernia repair and best practices in this area. We specifically looked at patient and hernia defect factors, technical considerations that have contributed to the successes, and some of the failures of laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR). Patients best suited for a laparoscopic repair are those who are obese and diabetic with a total defect size not to exceed 10\\u2009cm in width or a \"Swiss cheese\" defect. Overlap of mesh to healthy fascia of at least 5\\u2009cm in every direction, with closure of the defect, is essential to prevent recurrence or bulging over time. Complications specifically related to surgical site occurrence favor the laparoscopic approach. Recurrence rates, satisfaction, and health-related quality of life results are similar to open repairs, but long-term data are lacking. There is still conflicting data regarding ways of fixating the mesh. The science of prosthetic material appropriate for intraperitoneal placement continues to evolve. The field continues to be plagued by single author, single institution, and small nonrandomized observational studies with short-term follow-up. The recent development of large prospective databases might allow for pragmatic and point-of-care studies with long-term follow-up. We conclude that LVHR has evolved since its inception, has overcome many challenges, but still needs better long-term studies to evaluate evolving practices.', 20148599: StringElement('In the USA, rural residents have a higher burden of disease and more limited access to care than urban residents.

Increasingly, persons with DS have near-normal to normal life spans; thus, it has become a therapeutic imperative to preserve adaptive functions and ability to live as independently as possible in the least restrictive environment throughout adulthood. Data suggest that these histopathological changes and worsening adaptive functions result, at least in part, from the binding of the amyloidogenic A\\u03b21-42 peptide to \\u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (\\u03b17nAChRs) on the surface of neurons, which can lead to the internalization of the tightly-bound complex and cell lysis. Pharmacotherapeutic targeting of the \\u03b17nAChR may inhibit the creation of the A\\u03b21-42-\\u03b17nAChR complex, which has been observed both intraneuronally and as a component of the amyloid plaque seen in AD. Additionally, selective \\u03b17nAChR agonists may improve memory and cognition independently of their potential ability to attenuate the cytotoxicity of A\\u03b21-42 and retard the deposition of amyloid plaques in adults with DS. However, there are conflicting data supporting an antagonist strategy to improve cognition in the presence of elevated levels of A\\u03b2 amyloidogenic peptides, as well as to prevent emergence of pyramidal neuron hyperexcitability. A major challenge to the implementation of clinical trials of targeted \\u03b17nAChR interventions in adults with DS will be the ability to detect medication-induced changes in cognition in the context of intellectual disability. The Review will consider some of the current evidence supporting both the role of the A\\u03b21-42-\\u03b17nAChR complex in the pathogenesis of the AD-like histopathology in adult persons with DS, and pharmacotherapeutic interventions with \\u03b17nAChR agonists.\", 16540736: 'Estrogen receptor (ER) is a useful immunohistochemical marker of breast carcinomas and is commonly used as a means of distinguishing breast carcinomas from adenocarcinomas of other primary sites, including the lung. Previous reports have yielded conflicting data regarding ER immunoreactivity in primary pulmonary adenocarcinomas. In this study the immunohistochemical expression of ER was evaluated in 55 primary lung adenocarcinomas using the 1D5 antibody clone. Immunohistochemistry for thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), a sensitive and specific marker of pulmonary adenocarcinomas, was also performed. ER expression was observed in 10 (18%) of 55 lung adenocarcinomas. Most of these pulmonary adenocarcinomas showed ER immunoreactivity of weak or moderate intensity (<25% of tumor cell nuclei). However, two cases exhibited strong ER immunoreactivity (51-75% of neoplastic cells). Forty-six (84%) of the 55 lung adenocarcinomas were TTF-1 positive, including all those that expressed ER. These results indicate that a subset of pulmonary adenocarcinomas can exhibit ER immunoreactivity. As such, caution should be exercised in the use of ER immunohistochemistry alone as a means of distinguishing breast carcinomas from lung adenocarcinomas. In the context of an ER-positive lung neoplasm, strong and extensive TTF-1 immunoreactivity can be regarded as strong supportive evidence for a primary bronchogenic adenocarcinoma.', 26689922: \"Years of research have highlighted the importance of the immune system in Alzheimer's disease (AD), a system that, if manipulated during strategic time windows, could potentially be tackled to treat this disorder. However, to minimize adverse effects, it is essential to first grasp which exact aspect of it may be targeted. Several clues have been collected over the years regarding specific immune players strongly modulated during different stages of AD progression. However, the inherent complexity of the immune system as well as conflicting data make it quite challenging to pinpoint a specific immune target in AD. In this review, we discuss immune-related abnormalities observed in the periphery as well as in the brain of AD patients, in relation to known risk factors of AD such as genetics, type-2 diabetes or obesity, aging, physical inactivity and hypertension. Although not investigated yet in clinical trials, C5 complement system component, CD40/CD40L interactions and the CXCR2 pathway are altered in AD patients and may represent potential therapeutic targets. Immunotherapies tested in a clinical context, those aiming to attenuate the innate immune response and those used to facilitate the removal of pathological proteins, are further discussed to try and understand the causes of the limited success reached. The prevailing eagerness to move basic research data to clinic should not overshadow the fact that a careful preclinical characterization of a drug is still required to ultimately improve the chance of clinical success. Finally, specific elements to consider prior to initiate large-scale trials are highlighted and include the replication of preclinical data, the use of small-scale human studies, the sub-typing of AD patients and the determination of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics parameters such as brain bioavailability and target engagement.\", 22081925: StringElement('Conflicting data exist regarding the safety of pancreatic resections in elderly patients.

This review discusses many aspects of oxygen treatment: (i) basic studies on the effects of oxygen in ischaemia and the potential cardiovascular effects of oxygen metabolites; (ii) clinical trials that have assessed the value of inhaled oxygen, supersaturated oxygen, and intracoronary injection of hyperoxaemic solutions in myocardial infarction; and (iii) the haemodynamic effects of oxygen in various clinical scenarios and its direct effects on the coronary vasculature. Our findings suggest that there are conflicting data on the effects of oxygen treatment. Further, the potential harmful effects of oxygen must be considered, particularly in myocardial infarction.

The RB was measured by the intracellular oxidation of dihydrorhodamine after induction by Escherichia coli (E. coli), or priming with recombinant tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), followed by N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) stimulation. The phagocytic activity was determined by the intake of FITC-labelled opsonized E. coli.

Size exclusion chromatography demonstrated that the protease was a high-molecular-weight protein. Protein identification by mass-spectrometry analysis after ion exchange and size exclusion chromatography identified multiple proteases as possible candidates and aspartyl aminopeptidase, DNPEP, shared all the properties of the kidney lysate activity. Furthermore, recombinant GST-DNPEP produced similar proteolytic pattern. No mouse knockout model was, however, available to be used as negative control. In this study, we used a DNPEP-mutant mouse generated by EUCOMM as well as a novel CRISPR/cas9 mouse knockout to assess the activity of their kidney lysates towards SPAK. Two mouse models had to be used because different anti-DNPEP antibodies provided conflicting data on whether the EUCOMM mouse resulted in a true knockout. We show that in the absence of DNPEP, the kidney lysates retain their ability to cleave SPAK, indicating that DNPEP might have been misidentified as the protease behind the kidney lysate activity, or that the aspartyl aminopeptidase might not be the only protease cleaving SPAK in kidney.', 23302541: 'Telomeres are nucleoprotein caps flanking DNA. They are shortened by cell division and oxidative stress and are lengthened by the enzyme telomerase and DNA exchange during mitosis. Short telomeres induce cellular senescence. As an indicator of oxidative stress and senescence (2 processes thought to be fundamental to aging), telomere length is hypothesized to be a biomarker of aging. This hypothesis has been tested for more than a decade with epidemiologic study methods. In cross-sectional studies, researchers have investigated whether leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is associated with demographic, behavioral, and health variables. In prospective studies, baseline LTL has been used to predict mortality and occasionally other adverse health outcomes. Conflicting data have generated heated debate about the value of LTL as a biomarker of overall aging. In this review, we address the epidemiologic data on LTL and demonstrate that shorter LTL is associated with older age, male gender, Caucasian race, and possibly atherosclerosis; associations with other markers of health are equivocal. We discuss the reasons for discrepancy across studies, including a detailed review of methods for measuring telomere length as they apply to epidemiology. Finally, we conclude with questions about LTL as a biomarker of aging and how epidemiology can be used to answer these questions.', 8790414: \"Crohn disease (CD) is a chronic, panenteric intestinal inflammatory disease.

We employed reverse transcription PCR using M. paratuberculosis subspecies-specific primers (IS 900) on total RNA from 12 ileal mucosal specimens (CD, n = 8; controls, n = 4, 2 with ulcerative colitis and 2 with colonic cancer). As a negative control, we used Myobacterium avium DNA, originally cultured from the drinking water of a major city in the United States. cDNA sequence analysis shows that all eight cases of Crohn's disease and both samples from the patients with ulcerative colitis contained M. paratuberculosis RNA. Additionally, the M. avium control has the DNA sequence of M. paratuberculosis. We demonstrate the DNA sequence of M. paratuberculosis from mucosal specimens from humans with CD. The potable water supply may be a reservoir of infection. Although M. paratuberculosis signal in CD has been previously reported, a cause and effect relationship has not been established. In part, this is due to conflicting data from studies with empirical antimycobacterial therapy.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence and prognostic significance of cyclin D1 expression and p53 mutations in multiple myeloma, as well as the relationship of their expression with selected clinical data, histological features, and proliferative activity of myeloma cells. We analyzed bone marrow biopsy specimens obtained from 59 patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Expression of cyclin D1 and p53 was analyzed using standard immunohistochemical method of B5-fixed and routinely processed paraffin-embedded bone marrow specimens. Cyclin D1 was overexpressed in 14/59 (27%) and p53 in 5/59 (8.5%) specimens. There was no significant correlation between cyclin D1 overexpression and age, gender, clinical stage (Durie-Salmon classification), extent of osteolytic lesions, type of monoclonal protein, hemoglobin concentration, platelet count, serum concentration of creatinine, calcium, C-reactive protein, and beta2-microglobulin. No association was observed between the expression of cyclin D1 and the extent of bone marrow infiltration, histological grade, proliferative activity index (measured with Ki-67 immunoreactivity) and response to therapy. No significant difference was observed regarding overall survival between cyclin D1 positive and cyclin D1 negative patients (29 vs 36 mo, p = 0.76).

The aim of the current study was to perform a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing early vs. delayed invasive strategies for NSTE-ACS patients. Medline/CENTRAL and the Web were searched for RCTs comparing early vs. delayed invasive strategies for NSTE-ACS patients. The primary endpoint was all cause mortality, whereas myocardial infarction (MI), coronary revascularizations and 30-day major bleeding complications were secondary end points. Fixed or random effects models were used based on statistical heterogeneity. As a sensitivity analysis, Bayesian random effects meta-analysis was performed in addition to the classical random effects meta-analysis. A total of 5 RCTs were finally included, enrolling 4155 patients. As compared with a delayed strategy, an early invasive approach did not significantly reduce the rates of death [odds ratio (OR) 95% confidence interval (95% CI)\\u2009= 0.81 (95% CI 0.60-1.09), P = 0.17], MI [OR = 1.18 (95% CI 0.68-2.05), P = 0.55] or revascularizations [OR = 0.97 (0.77-1.24), P = 0.82]. There was a not significant trend toward fewer major bleeding complications for the early invasive approach [OR (95% CI)\\u2009= 0.76 (0.55-1.04), P = 0.08].

MRPs are classified as into three stages: initial, intermediate, and final stages, indicative of increased complexity and size, incurring different flavor, aroma, and texture. MRPs presence is known to reduce the nutritional quality of foods, particularly by reducing protein digestibility. Early reports have linked MRPs, especially advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) present in high concentration in the typical Western diet, to health conditions and diseases. However conflicting data has since been reported, and only a few (acrylamide, heterocyclic amines and 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural) MRPs have documented potential toxic or carcinogenic effects. High molecular weight MRPs are not available for direct absorption in the higher gastrointestinal tract, and are thus mostly metabolized by resident colonic microbes.

Both techniques require a primary antibody specific for the protein in question. WB data is band(s) on a membrane while IHC result is a staining on a tissue section. Most human genes are known to produce multiple protein isoforms; in agreement with that, multiple bands are often found on the WB membrane. However, a common but unspoken practice in WB is to cut away the extra band(s) and present for publication only the band of interest, which implies to the readers that only one form of protein is expressed and thus the data interpretation is straightforward. Similarly, few IHC studies discuss whether the antibody used is isoform-specific and whether the positive staining is derived from only one isoform. Currently, there is no reliable technique to determine the isoform-specificity of an antibody, especially for IHC. Therefore, cutting away extra band(s) on the membrane usually is a form of misconduct in WB, and a positive staining in IHC only indicates the presence of protein product(s) of the to-be-interrogated gene, and not necessarily the presence of the isoform of interest. We suggest that data of WB and IHC involving only one antibody should not be published and that relevant reports should discuss whether there may be protein multiplicity and whether the antibody used is isoform-specific.

This synthesis of the literature on radiation therapy for breast cancer is based on data from 29 randomized trials, 6 meta-analyses and 5 retrospective studies. In total, 40 scientific articles are included, involving 41 204 patients. The results were compared with those of a similar overview from 1996 including 285 982 patients. The conclusions reached can be summarized as follows: There is strong evidence for a substantial reduction in locoregional recurrence rate following postmastectomy radiation therapy to the chest wall and the regional nodal areas. There is strong evidence that postmastectomy radiation therapy increases the disease-free survival rate. There are conflicting data regarding the impact of postmastectomy radiotherapy upon overall survival. There is strong evidence that breast cancer specific survival is improved by postmastectomy radiotherapy. There is strong evidence for a decrease in non-breast cancer specific survival after postmastectomy radiotherapy. There is some evidence that overall survival is increased by optimal postmastectomy radiation therapy. There is strong evidence that postmastectomy radiotherapy in addition to surgery and systemic therapy in mainly node-positive patients decreases local recurrence rate and improves survival. There is moderate evidence that the decrease in non-breast cancer specific survival is attributed to cardiovascular disease in irradiated patients. There are conflicting data whether breast conservation surgery plus radiotherapy is comparable to modified radical mastectomy alone in terms of local recurrence rate. There is strong evidence that breast conservation surgery plus radiotherapy is comparable to modified radical mastectomy alone in terms of disease-free survival and overall survival. There is strong evidence that postoperative radiotherapy to the breast following breast conservation surgery results in a statistically and clinically significant reduction of ipsilateral breast recurrences followed by diminished need for salvage mastectomies. There is strong evidence that the omission of postoperative radiotherapy to the breast following breast conservation surgery has no impact on overall survival. In one meta-analysis including three randomized studies a survival advantage is demonstrated by Bayesian statistics. There is strong evidence that the addition of a radiation boost after conventional radiotherapy to the tumour bed after breast conservation surgery significantly decreases the risk of ipsilateral breast recurrences but has no impact on overall survival after short follow-up. There is strong evidence for the use of postoperative radiotherapy to the breast following breast conservation surgery for DCIS (ductal breast cancer in situ). Radiotherapy leads to a clinically and statistically significant reduction of both non-invasive and invasive ipsilateral breast recurrences.

So far, three drugs have been approved for the treatment of anaemia in patients with malignancies (epoetin alfa, epoetin beta and darbepoetin alfa). New concepts for the use of erythropoietin in cancer patients include 3- and 4-weekly dosing, as well as loading-dose concepts. Important factors helping to judge the impact of erythropoietin in cancer treatment include pharmacoeconomics and better predictive factors. Lately, the influence of erythropoietin therapy on survival in cancer patients has been discussed very intensively, because conflicting data have emerged. Studies aimed at correcting anaemia in cancer patients had indicated a possible survival advantage of those patients receiving erythropoietin. In contrast, two recent trials aimed at correction of haemoglobin levels beyond anaemia reported a poorer survival of patients receiving erythropoietin. This might grossly be attributed to a higher risk of thrombosis in these patients. The largest systematic review on the use of erythropoietin in cancer patients undergoing treatment indicates a suggestive but not significant survival advantage of erythropoietin-treated patients. In addition, very recent results of a Food and Drug Administration meeting on safety and survival of patients treated with erythropoietin are presented.', 14596518: \"A systematic review of radiation therapy trials in several tumour types was performed by The Swedish Council of Technology Assessment in Health Care (SBU). The procedures for evaluation of the scientific literature are described separately (Acta Oncol 2003; 42: 357-365). This synthesis of the literature on radiation therapy for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is based on data from seven randomized trials. Moreover, data from 17 prospective studies, 22 retrospective studies and 27 other articles were used. In total, 73 scientific articles are included, involving 13,305 patients. The results were compared with those of a similar overview from 1996 including 14,137 patients. The conclusions reached can be summarized as follows: Indolent lymphomas. Data indicate that one-third to one-half of patients with indolent lymphoma in stage I are cured by radiotherapy (follow-up more than 15 years). Addition of chemotherapy to radiotherapy does not indicate any improvement in overall outcome. Optimal radiation dose is not defined and extended field is not superior to involved field. Aggressive localized lymphomas. Data indicate that half of the patients in stage I are cured by radiotherapy alone. Although randomized and non-randomized studies favour combined modality treatment with chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy instead of radiotherapy or chemotherapy alone in localized disease, no firm conclusions can be drawn. Conflicting data have been published on the value of radiotherapy towards bulky disease and no firm conclusions can be drawn. Optimal dose for radiation alone or after chemotherapy has not been established. Total body irradiation (TBI). The value of TBI for treatment of NHL has not been proven. There is no proof that fractionated TBI in conjunction with high-dose chemotherapy is superior to chemotherapy regimens alone. Primary CNS lymphomas. Data show that radiotherapy induces a response of short duration and is associated with major neurotoxicity, especially in elderly patients. High-dose methotrexate therapy seems to lead to longer survival than radiotherapy alone. No randomized trials have been performed. There is fairly good support for primary chemotherapy including high-dose methotrexate followed by radiotherapy in patients below 60 years. To minimize the risk of neurotoxicity of combined modality treatment it has been proposed to use chemotherapy alone and delay radiotherapy for relapse, especially in patients above 60 years, or use it in chemotherapy-resistant disease. Optimal chemotherapy regimen is not defined and the role of radiotherapy remains to be determined. Head and neck lymphomas. There is some support for combined modality treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy for aggressive lymphomas in Waldeyer's ring with limited disease. There are sparse data supporting radiotherapy alone in localized indolent lymphomas in salivary glands. Radioimmunotherapy (RIT). Radioimmunotherapy is a new treatment modality with systemic radiation for patients with advanced NHL, where conventional external beam radiotherapy plays only a minor role. Several phase I and II studies with RIT have documented promising results. A variety of monoclonal antibodies, radionuclides and study designs with both myeloablative and non-myeloablative approach have resulted in high response rates in patients with recurrent or refractory NHL. One randomized clinical trial is published, showing superior therapy results with radiolabelled antibody compared with the corresponding unlabelled antibody.\", 2478503: \"The specificity of the High Iron Diamine-Alcian Blue pH 2.5 (HID-AB 2.5) procedure was examined in tissue sites containing sialogycoproteins alone or differing proportions of sialo- and sulphosialoglycoproteins. Studies with HID in differing final concentrations of hydrochloric acid or sodium chloride confirmed that staining is dependent upon both the pH and the ionic strength of the dye bath and demonstrated a marked heterogeneity in the pKa of the anionic groups of sialosulphoglycoproteins. Use of the sequence High Iron Diamine-Alcian Blue pH 1.0 demonstrated that complete or almost complete staining of O-sulphate esters occurred when HID was prepared in water (final pH 1.3). However, under these conditions HID-AB 2.5 was shown to be non-specific because only black HID staining was observed in sites containing large quantities of sialic acids. This non-specificity was due either to the masking of Alcian Blue staining by HID and/or the black HID staining of anionic groups other than sulphate. These results may account for some of the conflicting data obtained by different groups of investigators who have studied 'transitional mucosa' in human colonic diseases. Caution should be used in drawing conclusions from the use of HID-AB 2.5 without confirmatory evidence from other more specific procedures.\", 2684316: 'In this review the arguments for a relation between female sex hormones and rheumatoid arthritis are discussed. Clinical evidence includes a relation between disease activity and menstrual cycle and a clear decrease in disease activity during pregnancy.

In vitro gonadal hormones suppress T-lymphocyte proliferation, while B-lymphocyte differentiation is enhanced by oestrogens and diminished by testosterone. Some pilot studies suggest that oestrogens may ameliorate disease activity in women with active rheumatoid arthritis.

Moreover, there are conflicting data on the role of acetylator phenotype as a susceptibility factor for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Because most investigations have previously been conducted with relatively small sample sizes, the present study was performed to clarify the possible association between genotypes and SLE among a large European cohort. In a case-control study, 209 patients with SLE (194 women, 15 men) were enrolled and matched by gender to 209 controls without clinical signs of inflammatory diseases. All SLE patients fulfilled at least four of the revised American College of Rheumatology classification criteria of SLE. was genotyped for seven known mutations by polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism. The frequency of slow acetylation genotypes in SLE patients (59.8%) did not differ significantly from controls (56.5%). The adjusted odds ratio (OR) was 0.95 (95% confidence interval, 0.59-1.53). Further differentiation to gender, cigarette consumption, allergic disorders and specific SLE manifestations revealed an equal distribution of genotypes in all subgroups.

Several factors point to a causal relationship. It is important now to review the evidence derived from clinical, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and neuropathological studies to determine whether the protective effect of zidovudine on the brain of patients with HIV infection has implications for clinical practice. It has been demonstrated in clinical studies that patients with ADC may improve with zidovudine treatment and that the development of ADC is rare in patients receiving the nucleoside analogue long term. In support of these clinical findings, CSF studies have revealed that the presence of HIV-1 p24 antigen has diagnostic value in patients with suspected ADC and that p24 antigen levels decline with zidovudine treatment. Supporting evidence has also come from neuropathological studies, which have demonstrated that zidovudine decreases HIV-specific neuropathological abnormalities. Recently, the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study reported conflicting data which suggested that antiretroviral therapy is not protective against ADC; however, several methodological weaknesses of this study limit the general applicability of the findings and the conclusions. In view of the increasing body of evidence in support of the efficacy of zidovudine in the prevention and management of ADC in patients with HIV-1 infection, it seems reasonable to include this antiretroviral agent in any combination treatment regimen. Many questions remain to be answered, however, before management of such patients is optimised. Meanwhile, in order to increase both insight and evidence, it is imperative that ongoing and future clinical trials with antiretroviral drugs closely monitor all cases of progression to ADC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)', 8276405: 'The human smooth muscle myosin heavy chain locus (MYH11) was mapped by fluorescence in situ hybridization to the middle of the p arm of chromosome 16 using a genomic cosmid clone containing coding sequences of the gene as probe.

Coding sequence PCR primers, when used on the DNA from a CHO-mouse hybrid clone mapping panel informative for mouse chromosomes, showed that the gene was located on mouse chromosome 16. These results correct a recent assignment of MYH11 from 16q12.2 to the region of the 16p-arm inversion breakpoint seen in acute myelomonocytic leukemia (AMML) M4Eo and demonstrate that the conflicting data do not result from the presence of additional MYH genes on the q arm of the chromosome.

While some evidence supports the idea that there is a strand bias to the hypermutation mechanism, conflicting data suggest that somatic mutations are initially acquired on both strands of DNA. In this study, we utilized a previously defined trinucleotide target bias of hypermutation to address the question of target strand symmetry during mutation. Mutabilities of specific base positions within all triplets were compared between the two strands of DNA in three divergent databases of hypermutated sequences. Unexpectedly, we consistently observed strong correlations between mutabilities of triplet positions on the two DNA strands only for G and T in the first position of a triplet or for C and A in the last position. The most straightforward interpretation of this result is that the mutation mechanism targets either G and T or C and A on both strands of DNA with a frequency that depends upon the adjacent dinucleotide sequence. In view of published evidence that C is targeted by the hypermutation mechanism, we can extrapolate that C and A are specifically targeted at a frequency that depends upon the preceding 5' dinucleotide.\", 21883323: StringElement('There is no satisfactory medical treatment for patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis.

The main primary reasons for untrue or inexplicit morphological phylogenies are: not enough characters developed between branching points, uncertain character polarity, poorly differentiated character states, homoplasy caused by parallelism or reversal, and extinction, which may remove species entirely from consideration and can make originally conflicting data sets misleadingly compatible, increasing congruence at the expense of truth. Extinction differs from other confounding factors in not being apparent either in the data set or in subsequent analysis. One possibility is that variation in the quality of morphological phylogenies has resulted from exposure to different ecological situations. To investigate this, it is necessary to compare the histories of the clades concerned. In the case of explicit morphological phylogenies, ecological and behavioural data can be integrated with them and it may then be possible to decide whether morphological characters are likely to have been elicited by the environments through which the clade has passed. The credibility of such results depends not only on the phylogeny being robust but also on its detailed topology: a pectinate phylogeny will often allow more certain and more explicit statements to be made about historical events. In the case of poor phylogenies, it is not possible to produce detailed histories, but they can be compared with robust phylogenies in the range of ecological situations occupied, and whether they occupy novel situations in comparison with their outgroups. LeQuesne testing can give information about niche homoplasy, and it may also be possible to see if morphological features are functionally associated with ecological parameters, even if the direction of change is unknown. Examination of the robust and explicit phylogeny of the semaphore geckoes (Pristurus) suggests that its quality does stem from a variety of environmental factors. The group has progressed along an ecological continuum, passing through a series of increasingly severe niches that appear to have elicited many morphological changes. The fact that niches are progressively filled reduces the likelihood of species reinvading a previous one with related character reversal. Because the niches of advanced Pristurus are virtually unique within the Gekkonidae the morphological changes produced are also very rare and therefore easy to polarize. Ecological changes on the main stem of the phylogeny are abrupt and associated character states consequently well differentiated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)', 6189502: 'In view of the central side effects of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents and their alleged antipsychotic action in the absence of DA receptor blockade, it is important to establish which neurotransmitters are likely to be involved. Previous animal and patient studies have, however, produced conflicting data on this point. The changes in CSF HVA, 5HIAA and MHPG during treatment with propranolol (960 mg/day) in chronic schizophrenic patients were monitored on four occasions over 30 days. Clinical changes were monitored by the Wing and Krawiecka Scales and motor activity was assessed by pedometer. CSF HVA levels were significantly increased by propranolol and the rise continued throughout the 30 day period. There were no significant changes in the other metabolites. There was no evidence of any therapeutic benefit from propranolol treatment in these patients. These findings may explain the central side-effects and occasional reports of schizophreniform psychosis after propranolol, since an increase in DA turnover occurs without DA receptor blockade.', 21789119: 'Pre- and peri-operative strategies are becoming standard for the management of localized gastro-esophageal cancer. For localized gastric/gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) cancer there are conflicting data that a peri-operative approach with cisplatin-based chemotherapy improves survival, with the benefits seen in esophageal cancer likely less than a 5-10% incremental improvement. Further trends toward improvement in local control and survival, when combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy are given pre-operatively, are suggested by recent phase III trials. In fit patients, a significant survival benefit with pre-operative chemoradiation is seen in those patients who achieve a pathologic complete response. In esophageal/GEJ cancer, definitive chemoradiation is now considered in medically inoperable patients. In squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, surgery after primary chemoradiation is not clearly associated with an improved overall survival, however, local control may be better. In localized gastric/GEJ cancer, the integration of bevacizumab with pre-operative chemotherapy is being explored in large randomized studies, and with chemoradiotherapy in pilot trials. The addition of anti-epidermal growth factor receptor and anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 antibody treatment to pre-operative chemoradiation continues to be explored. Early results show the integration of targeted therapy is feasible. Metabolic imaging can predict early response to pre-operative chemotherapy and biomarkers may further predict response to pre-operative chemo-targeted therapy. A multimodality approach to localized gastro-esophageal cancer has resulted in better outcomes. For T3 or node-positive disease, surgery alone is no longer considered appropriate and neo-adjuvant therapy is recommended.

To examine the current evidence for the efficacy and safety of ketamine and propofol in combination for procedural sedation and analgesia, we searched the MEDLINE (1966-March 2007), EMBASE (1980-March 2007), and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (through the first quarter of 2007) databases for reports describing the use of ketamine and propofol in combination for procedural sedation and analgesia. Additional published reports were identified through a manual search of references from retrieved articles. Prospective, comparative, full-text reports of studies performed in humans that were published in English were reviewed for inclusion. Both authors independently evaluated all studies. Studies in adult and pediatric patients were included if they evaluated efficacy or safety end points. Eight clinical trials were included, seven of which compared a combination of propofol and ketamine with propofol monotherapy. In these trials, variable milligram:milligram ratios of propofol and ketamine were used, ranging from 10:1-2:1, and the optimum dose of these agents in combination is unclear. Combination propofol and ketamine has not demonstrated superior clinical efficacy compared with propofol alone for procedural sedation and analgesia. Conflicting data exist regarding reduced hemodynamic and respiratory complications in patients receiving the combination compared with propofol monotherapy. At higher doses, the addition of ketamine to propofol may incur more adverse effects. Compatibility data for the two agents combined in a syringe are limited. The available evidence does not support the use of a fixed-dose ketamine-propofol combination for procedural sedation and analgesia. Further research is needed to elucidate the role, if any, of this combination for procedural sedation and analgesia.', 3145463: 'One of the several sources of interest in aging animal brains is their potential as models of the aging human brain. In this review we examine whether neuron numbers and sizes change similarly in aging human, monkey and rodent brain regions which data are available from more than one species. The number of brain regions studied in more than one species is surprisingly limited. Some regions show correspondence in age-related changes between humans and selected animal models (primary visual cortex, CA1 of hippocampus). For the majority of regions the data are conflicting, even within one species (e.g., somatosensory cortex, frontal cortex, cerebellum, cholinergic forebrain areas, locus coeruleus). Although some of the conflicting data may be attributed to procedural differences, particularly when data are expressed as density changes, much must be attributed to real species and/or strain differences in rodents. We conclude that neuron numbers and sizes may show similar age-related changes in human and animal brains only for sharply defined brain regions, animal species and/or strains, and age ranges.', 19927500: 'In the face of these conflicting data, how should the practicing surgeon approach the issue of tight glucose control in their critically ill surgical patients? The answer to that question may well change over time as new data emerge. For now, however, it seems reasonable to conclude that tight glucose control to the normal range (80-110 mg/dL) in critically ill general surgery patients (i.e., the Van den Berghe model) is an intriguing but unproven hypothesis that needs to be confirmed by prospective randomized trials in different ICUs and in a relevant patient population. It is quite possible, and probably likely, that levels of hyperglycemia that were previously thought to be inconsequential (180-200 mg/dL) may be harmful when sustained over prolonged periods of time and that better glucose control in the ICU than previously practiced is merited. However, given the detrimental effects of hypoglycemia, great care must be exercised in trying to achieve better glucose control so as not to induce harm. Technical considerations such as differences in glucose measuring systems, use of morning versus all glucose values, and nutritional regimens all need to be considered. The ICU is by definition a complex environment involving multiple teams of consulting specialists whose orders for medications, dialysis treatments, radiographic studies, and interruptions of enteral nutrition may all disrupt the ability to establish stable blood glucose levels. These factors need to be accounted for in daily clinical practice and their roles need to be better understood in future clinical trials. At present, it seems reasonable to attempt to control blood glucose levels in critically ill general surgery patients to moderate levels that avoid deleterious hypoglycemia but have been associated with encouraging clinical results until better data emerge. Until that time, the clinician will need to attempt to balance the potentially detrimental effects of hyperglycemia with the risk of hypoglycemia carefully until future trials involving general surgery patients are completed to clarify this issue.', 21375444: 'Abortive drugs used for migraine in children and adolescents are usually the same as those used in adults.

The PubMed research produced 481 results and only seven studies were randomized controlled trials. A total of 11 articles were reviewed. Zolmitriptan and rizatriptan were superior to placebo in most studies. Almotriptan demonstrated a high profile of tolerability. A single study of eletriptan demonstrated no statistical difference between this drug and placebo in terms of both efficacy and tolerability. All studies have reported a good triptan safety profile. The conflicting data regarding triptan efficacy are probably due to differences in populations, methodologies and efficacy measures among the different studies.

Some TS patients, probably 50% or more, experience substantial, long-term symptomatic improvement with minimal side effects. However, their profile of response is often variable, with behavioral symptoms appearing to show the most consistent improvement. Maximal benefit may not be evident for 4 to 6 months. A minority of patients do not respond, and a few worsen on clonidine. The need for additional double-blind trials is clear. Additional metabolic and pharmacologic investigations are needed to understand the determinants of the response of TS patients to clonidine. The response to acute doses of clonidine on sedation, growth hormone release, blood pressure, and plasma MHPG levels may be predictive of eventual therapeutic response. The variable response to clonidine, however, suggests that noradrenergic mechanisms in TS may not be of primary pathogenic importance. The study of interactions between neurochemical systems may help illuminate the pathophysiology of TS and lead the way to improved treatment of this disabling condition.', 7842265: 'The treatment of membranous nephropathy, the most common form of glomerular diseases causing nephrotic syndrome in adults, is still debated. A considerable percentage of patients have a spontaneous remission of the disease and reduction of urinary protein excretion with time. Studies in the past have indicated that prednisone may have beneficial effects, but this has not been confirmed by more recent investigation. Others have studied the association of methylprednisolone with cyclophosphamide or chlorambucil, but results are conflicting. The main reasons for the conflicting data are the variety of clinical presentations of the disease and the different study populations. Most trials performed so far have not included enough patients in each category to adequately detect differences between treatment groups and placebo groups. Several studies with few numbers of patients reported that cyclosporine effectively reduced proteinuria and may have less long-term toxicity than more conventional immunosuppressants.

There are conflicting data in this regard with respect to troponin I (TnI). We recently showed a high incidence of elevated TnI levels in asymptomatic hemodialysis (HD) patients using a new generation sensitive TnI assay. The aim of this pilot study was to explore the prognostic value of TnI, as measured with this new assay, as a marker for outcomes in HD patients over a 2-year follow-up period. Fifty-one asymptomatic HD patients were enrolled, and pre-dialysis TnI levels were checked once monthly over 3 consecutive months. Patients were considered to be in the TnI positive group if TnI level on any of the three draws was \\u22650.035 ng/ml. All patients were followed for a period of 2 years. The primary end points were acute coronary syndrome, coronary revascularization, sudden death, or cardiac arrest. The secondary end point was all-cause mortality. Elevated TnI levels were found in 51% (26/51) of patients in our cohort. One TnI positive patient was subsequently lost to follow up. There were 6 cardiac events over 2 years, all of which were in the troponin positive group (6/25 or 24%). The presence of a positive TnI at baseline was significantly associated with future cardiac events (p=0.022). A prior history of coronary artery disease (CAD) was also significantly related to future cardiac events (p=0.010). No patient with negative TnI at baseline developed a cardiac event, while 45.5% of those with both a positive TnI and a history of CAD had an event. Fourteen deaths occurred over 2 years, 8 in TnI positive and 6 in the negative group. All-cause mortality was not associated with elevated TnI levels at baseline. We found a significant association between positive TnI and subsequent cardiac events in asymptomatic HD patients followed for 2 years. TnI levels, as measured with a sensitive assay, may be useful in assessing cardiac risk in asymptomatic HD patients.

Most disease in developed countries is caused by serogroup B infection, against which there is no universal vaccine. Opacity-associated adhesin (Opa) proteins are major meningococcal outer membrane proteins, which have shown recent promise as a potential novel vaccine. Immunisation of mice with different Opa variants elicited high levels of meningococcal-specific bactericidal antibodies, demonstrating proof in principle for this approach. Opa proteins are critical in meningococcal pathogenesis, mediating bacterial adherence to host cells, and modulating human cellular immunity via interactions with T cells and neutrophils, although there are conflicting data regarding their effects on CD4(+) T cells. We constructed Opa-positive and Opa-negative meningococcal strains to allow further evaluation of Opa as a vaccine component. All four opa genes from N. meningitidis strain H44/76 were sequentially disrupted to construct all possible combinations of N. meningitidis strains deficient in one, two, three, or all four opa genes. The transformations demonstrated that homologous recombination of exogenous DNA into the meningococcal chromosome can occur with as little as 80 bp, and that minor sequence differences are permissible. Anti-Opa bactericidal antibody responses following immunisation of mice with recombinant Opa were specific to the Opa variant used in immunisation. No immunomodulatory effects were observed when Opa was contained within meningococcal outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), compared to Opa-negative OMVs. These observations support the incorporation of Opa in meningococcal vaccines.', 20660702: 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, also called statins, are commonly prescribed medications that lower serum cholesterol and decrease cardiac morbidity and mortality. They also possess beneficial effects beyond their cholesterol-lowering properties. Preclinical data suggest statins exhibit pleiotropic antineoplastic effects in a variety of tumours, but clinical studies have provided conflicting data as to whether statins influence the risk of cancer. The biological underpinning of potential effects of statins in colorectal cancer and their role in its prevention or as adjuvant therapy are reviewed. Following a meta-analysis of both randomised clinical trials and epidemiological studies, it is concluded that available clinical data only support a modest, although statistically significant, protective effect of statins in colorectal cancer. Statins may impact on outcomes by decreasing the invasiveness or metastatic properties of colorectal cancer. The data supporting these hypotheses, however, are few and further studies are required to better assess these hypotheses. Statins may also exert a beneficial effect on colorectal cancer by sensitising the tumour to chemotherapeutic agents. Further research is needed to better define the role of statins in overcoming chemoresistance. The combination of statins with other drugs, such as low-dose aspirin or safer non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, may be useful in both the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer.', 9541096: 'Increased in vitro apoptosis and altered expression of apoptosis-related molecules have been reported in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Conflicting data about the level of cellular apoptosis from animal models for SLE and human SLE indicate different pathomechanisms. In the present study we analysed the count of circulating early apoptotic cells and its correlation with the clinical activity in SLE compared with the amount in primary systemic vasculitis (PSV).

Analysis of lymphocytes revealed significantly increased counts in the T cell populations (NHD 5.15%, SLE 12.22%, PSV 10.01%), whereas the increase in B cells did not reach significance level (NHD 9.20%, SLE 18.95%, PSV 16.59%). Apoptotic cell count revealed no correlation to SLAM-Score or to immunosuppressive therapy, corticosteroid-dosage or absolute lymphocyte count. The general increase of circulating apoptotic cells may indicate an impaired clearance in SLE patients, independent of clinical activity or therapeutic interventions. Autoantigens from apoptotic cells may contribute to both activation of autoreactive lymphocytes and formation of immune complexes.', 15950428: 'Incidence of clinical mastitis is highest at drying off and during the periparturient period. Intramammary Escherichia coli infection in high-yielding cows can show a severe clinical response during the early post-partum period. Severe clinical mastitis is mainly determined by cow factors, in particular the functionality of the circulating polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) which are recruited to the mammary gland during the inflammatory reaction. There is a co-incidence between the periods of highest incidence of clinical mastitis and specific structural changes in the mammary gland. During the periparturient period, marked changes in various systemic and local hormones are related to the secretory state of the mammary gland epithelium (lactogenesis). Estrogen and progesterone induce proliferation of the mammary epithelium throughout gestation and act as survival factors in different tissues, although conflicting data have been reported on their effect on PMN oxidative burst. Somatotropin (STH), responsible for maintenance of lactation in ruminants, has been shown to positively influence innate immunity and a more rapid recovery in milk production of severely affected animals. The concentration of STH, and as a result also IGF-I levels is, however, quite low during early lactation. IGF-I and its regulating binding proteins are associated with cell survival, modulation of apoptosis and functionality of PMN in humans. During early lactation, bio-availability of IGF-I is decreased, which might reduce its stimulating effects on PMN quality and functionality. PRL, concomitantly known as a lactogenic hormone and an immunoregulatory cytokine, has also been associated with modulation of the immune system. It is expected that in periparturient animals, hormone changes could interfere with the immune response and the clinical response of mastitis.', 1444321: \"Conflicting data have been reported on ability of 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) to protect mononuclear phagocytes from HIV-1 infection. We compared the antiviral potency of AZT in three types of primary human mononuclear phagocytes: peripheral blood monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages (in vitro differentiated) and alveolar macrophages (in vivo differentiated). To establish highly-productive virus infection, purified cells (greater than 99%) from healthy donors were challenged with the macrophage-tropic HTLV-IIIBa-L strain at input multiplicities ranging from 0.05 to 20 TCID50 per cell. AZT (0.1 nM-10 microM) was added immediately after infection and either continued for the duration of the experiment or stopped 1-7 days after infection. The kinetics of HIV-1Ba-L replication were assessed by measuring p24 antigen production on days 4-28 post-infection. Continuous treatment with AZT reproducibly inhibited viral replication in a concentration-dependent manner in all three cell types. The IC90 of AZT was 0.04 microM in blood monocytes, 0.009 microM in monocyte-derived macrophages, and 0.0001 microM in alveolar macrophages (mean of 3-4 donors for each cell type). AZT was not cytotoxic at less than 10 microM as assessed by cell viability, cell protein, and interferon-gamma-activated H2O2-release. In experiments in which AZT treatment was stopped after infection, viral replication resumed after a lag of 7-14 days and increased exponentially toward control levels. This occurred despite initial inhibition of virus production to below the limit of p24 detection (approximately 50 pg/ml). These results indicate that AZT is a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 replication in primary mononuclear phagocytes regardless of the stage of cell differentiation, and that AZT is most active in tissue (alveolar) macrophages. AZT does not irreversibly block infection of mononuclear phagocytes, however, as viral replication resumes after removal of AZT.\", 25405922: StringElement('Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) recipients are more susceptible to infections from vaccine-preventable diseases than the general population.

A randomised, controlled crossover trial involving 19 patients with a first-ever diagnosis of OSAS measured the effect of conventional heated humidification added to CPAP compared with a controlled heated breathing tube humidifier (ThermoSmart(R); Fisher and Paykel Healthcare, Auckland, New Zealand) on sleep quality. During the night in the sleep laboratory at a mean room temperature of 14 degrees C, less condensation formed with the controlled heated breathing tube humidifier (1.9 mL versus 35.3 mL) in the delivery system.

We determined the fracture incidence relative to matched controls in a population-based cohort with celiac disease before and after diagnosis. Olmsted County residents with celiac disease (n = 83) diagnosed between 1950 and 2002 were compared with 166 gender and age matched controls. Fracture histories were ascertained from each subject's medical records. Celiac disease is linked to an increased fracture risk before and after diagnosis. Before the index date, cases had a fracture rate twice that of controls (CI: 1.0-3.9, P = 0.045) and 2.5-fold greater after the index date (CI: 1.1-5.6, P = 0.026). Appendicular and axial fractures were 2.5 (CI: 0.9-6.5) and 3.2 times more likely (CI: 1.0-10.5) after the index date.

More importantly, only 2 of the 3 patients with definite HIT were confirmatory test positive. Therefore, the high-dose heparin confirmatory test should be used with caution to exclude platelet-activating antiplatelet factor 4/heparin antibodies or clinical HIT.', 15974890: 'Aldosterone plays an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. We have reported that aldosterone is synthesized in cardiovascular tissues and local aldosterone synthesis plays important roles for hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy. High sodium intake develops and accelerates vascular injury and cardiac hypertrophy in SHRSP. Plasma aldosterone concentrations and PRA were decreased by high salt intake in SHRSP. Aldosterone production, the expression of CYP11B2 mRNA and angiotensin II receptor AT1R mRNA in blood vessels were significantly increased by high salt intake. These results suggest that high salt intake increases aldosterone production and expression of the AT1R mRNA in the vascular tissue in SHRSP, which may contribute to the development of malignant hypertension in salt-loaded SHRSP. However, there are several reports of conflicting data. Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) binding is tightly regulated by the enzyme 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11beta-HSD2) which selectively metabolizes glucocorticoids to inactive metabolites, thus allowing for MR activation by aldosterone. We have reported that decreased 11beta-HSD2 in blood vessels in Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) rats, a model for salt-sensitive hypertension. Local aldosterone excess may play a significant role in the salt sensitivity and development of hypertension. High sodium intake decreased circulating rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and increased blood pressure and cardiac hypertrophy in DS rats, which were prevented by the treatment with a selective MR antagonist, eplerenone. Eplerenone also improved endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity and eNOS mRNA expression in blood vessels in DS rats. These results further suggest that not only circulating aldosterone but also local aldosterone is of critical importance in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disorders.', 9853425: \"In the medical literature there are frequently conflicting reports on the utility of biological tumour markers available in the clinical management of breast cancer. In this review we analyse current information on the relationships between the most widely investigated breast cancer biological markers including oestrogen and progesterone receptors, p53, Bcl-2, c-erbB-2, cyclin expression, proliferative activity, DNA ploidy and the urokinase plasminogen activation system, as well as their relevance to prognosis and response to clinical treatment. By biological prognostic indicator, we mean a marker that correlates with survival and disease-free survival; the term predictor marker indicates a marker that is capable of predicting tumour sensitivity or resistance to various therapies. Similarly to other authors' experiences, our analysis suggests that oestrogen receptors are weak prognostic indicators and good predictors of response to endocrine therapy. Furthermore, there are consistent data suggesting that proliferation indices are good indicators of prognosis, and that they are directly related to response to chemotherapy and closely related to response to hormonotherapy. On the contrary, there is no evidence or conflicting data for all of the other biological markers. These should be considered in the context of randomized trials in order to precisely define their prognostic and predictive roles. p53 and c-erbB-2 seem to be the most promising factors, but their use in routine practice still needs validation.\", 25784818: \"Epoetin beta belongs to the class of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) that are currently available to treat anemic patients receiving chemotherapy.

Furthermore, other therapeutic targets such as free radical scavenger strategies and the anti-inflammatory neuroprotective strategy have been evaluated with conflicting data in animal models and human subjects with acute ischemic stroke. Whereas promising combinations of neuroprotection and neurorecovery, such as citicoline, albumin and cerebrolysin have been tested with findings worthy of further evaluation in larger randomized clinical trials. Understanding the complexities of the ischemic cascade is essential to developing pharmacological targets for acute ischemic stroke in neuroprotective or flow restoration therapeutic strategies.', 21711350: 'Chronic antigenic stimulation leads to gradual accumulation of late-differentiated, antigen-specific, oligoclonal T cells, particularly within the CD8(+) T-cell compartment. They are characterized by critically shortened telomeres, loss of CD28 and/or gain of CD57 expression and are defined as either CD8(+) CD28(-) or CD8(+) CD57(+) T lymphocytes. There is growing evidence that the CD8(+) CD28(-) (CD8(+) CD57(+)) T-cell population plays a significant role in various diseases or conditions, associated with chronic immune activation such as cancer, chronic intracellular infections, chronic alcoholism, some chronic pulmonary diseases, autoimmune diseases, allogeneic transplantation, as well as has a great influence on age-related changes in the immune system status. CD8(+) CD28(-) (CD8(+) CD57(+)) T-cell population is heterogeneous and composed of various functionally competing (cytotoxic and immunosuppressive) subsets thus the overall effect of CD8(+) CD28(-) (CD8(+) CD57(+)) T-cell-mediated immunity depends on the predominance of a particular subset. Many articles claim that CD8(+) CD28(-) (CD8(+) CD57(+)) T cells have lost their proliferative capacity during process of replicative senescence triggered by repeated antigenic stimulation. However recent data indicate that CD8(+) CD28(-) (CD8(+) CD57(+)) T cells can transiently up-regulate telomerase activity and proliferate under certain stimulation conditions. Similarly, conflicting data is provided regarding CD8(+) CD28(-) (CD8(+) CD57(+)) T-cell sensitivity to apoptosis, finally leading to the conclusion that this T-cell population is also heterogeneous in terms of its apoptotic potential. This review provides a comprehensive approach to the CD8(+) CD28(-) (CD8(+) CD57(+)) T-cell population: we describe in detail its origins, molecular and functional characteristics, subsets, role in various diseases or conditions, associated with persistent antigenic stimulation.', 25197047: u'In preclinical studies, endothelin receptor A (ETA) antagonists (ETAi) attenuated the progression of heart failure (HF). However, clinical HF trials failed to demonstrate beneficial effects of ETAi. These conflicting data may be explained by the possibility that established HF drugs such as adrenergic receptor blockers interfered with the mechanism of ETAi action in clinical trials. Here we report that mice lacking ETA only in sympathetic neurons (SN-KO) showed less adverse structural remodeling and cardiac dysfunction in response to pathological pressure overload induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). In contrast, mice lacking ETA only in cardiomyocytes (CM-KO) were not protected. TAC led to a disturbed sympathetic nerve function as measured by cardiac norepinephrine (NE) tissue levels and [(124)I]-metaiodobenzylguanidine-PET, which was prevented in SN-KO. In a rat model of HF, ETAi improved cardiac and sympathetic nerve function. In cocultures of cardiomyocytes (CMs) and sympathetic neurons (SNs), endothelin-1 (ET1) led to a massive NE release and exaggerated CM hypertrophy compared with CM monocultures. ETA-deficient CMs gained a hypertrophic response through wild-type SNs, but ETA-deficient SNs failed to mediate exaggerated CM hypertrophy. Furthermore, ET1 mediated its effects indirectly via NE in CM-SN cocultures through adrenergic receptors and histone deacetylases, resulting in activation of the prohypertrophic transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2. In conclusion, sympathetic ETA amplifies ET1 effects on CMs through adrenergic signaling pathways. Thus, antiadrenergic therapies may blunt potentially beneficial effects of ETAi. Taken together, this may indicate that patients with \\u03b2 blocker intolerance or disturbed sympathetic nerve function could be evaluated for a potential benefit from ETAi.', 17220089: 'Apart from analyses for elemental contaminants in field-collected specimens, very little is known about the assimilation and accumulation of inorganic contaminants in reptiles. Recent dietary studies with reptiles (and some other vertebrates and invertebrates) have taken care to incorporate the principles of trophic transfer by pre-exposing prey items to the elemental contaminant of interest. However, there are conflicting data in the literature as to whether biologically incorporated metals are more bioavailable to consumers in a food chain than simple salts added to the diet, and this study examines this issue in a lacertid lizard. Adult individuals of Podarcis carbonelli were exposed to cadmium (Cd) in a 21-week dietary study to determine whether the form in which the Cd is provided influences assimilation efficiency for this metal. Lizards were provided with Cd that had either been biologically incorporated into crickets or as Cd(NO3)2 added superficially to crickets just prior to feeding. Radiospectrometric analysis for 109Cd in animal tissues and fecal material was used to follow Cd accumulation over the duration of exposure. The highest levels of accumulation were found within the gut. This, combined with the observation of higher rates of assimilation over the first five weeks, strongly suggests a rapid accumulation of Cd within the gut tissue followed by a slower redistribution to other tissues. No statistically different levels of Cd assimilation efficiency were detected between the two treatment groups, nor were there any statistically significant differences between the two treatment groups in relation to the proportional distribution to the gut, liver, or kidneys.', 28904191: 'IMPORTANCEIn infections with retroviruses, like HIV and FV infection of mice, NK cells clearly mediate antiviral activities, but they are usually not sufficient to prevent severe pathology. Here we show that the initial infection dose impacts the induction of an antiviral NK cell response during an acute retroviral infection, which had not investigated before. High-dose infection resulted in a strong NK cell functionality, whereas no antiviral activities were detected after low- or medium-dose infection. Interestingly, DCs and macrophages were highly activated after high-dose FV challenge, which corresponded with increased levels of NK cell-stimulating cytokines IL-15 and IL-18. IL-15 and IL-18 neutralization decreased NK cell functions, whereas IL-15 and IL-18 therapy improved NK cell activity. Here we show the importance of cytokines for NK cell activation in retroviral infections; our findings suggest that immunotherapy combining the well-tolerated cytokines IL-15 and IL-18 might be an interesting approach for antiretroviral treatment.', 9829496: StringElement('Previous studies have demonstrated that hyperhomocyst(e)inaemia is present in patients with impaired renal function and is correlated with cardiovascular disease.

The difficulties in precisely identifying target cells using histological/cell marker criteria, and hence determining the role of their mode of death in tissue responses, are being circumvented to some extent by the recent use of mice deficient in gene products required for radiation-induced apoptosis. In this case cell death results from 'mitotic cell death' and e.g. in the case of p53, any remaining p53-independent apoptosis. In the p53 null mouse, cell survival levels are increased in bone marrow and intestine but decreased in the testis. Different interpretations, based on the lack of p53-dependent apoptosis or the lack of a permanently induced G1-arrest in the case of marrow fibroblasts, can be applied to the results for different cell types. Hence both apoptosis and mitotic cell death can variously be involved as contributing to target-cell sensitivity and hence to early reactions in these tissues after irradiation. It is still unclear whether, or how, the mode of cell death (apoptotic versus mitotic) determines the radiosensitivity and response of tumours. In experimental tumours, the levels of radiation-induced apoptosis have been shown to correlate both with the in vivo response to radiation and the degree of spontaneous apoptosis in the tumours. Measurements of spontaneous apoptosis in human tumours, however, have yielded conflicting data with high apoptotic levels significantly correlating with both good and poor prognosis in different studies. There is one report of a lack of relationship between intrinsic radiosensitivity and spontaneous apoptosis in cervical cancers. In contrast several studies have reported correlations between apoptosis levels and the degree of tumour cell proliferation. Tumour hypoxia has also been shown to increase apoptosis. These data suggest that tumour apoptosis may be a reflection of intrinsic radiosensitivity, tumour cell proliferation and tumour hypoxia. Its relative importance will probably be tumour type, size and stage related.\", 11981317: 'Specific inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-2 were introduced into widespread clinical use in 1999. Since that time, celecoxib and rofecoxib have become two of the most commonly prescribed medications in the United States. Clinical trials using these medications for arthritis and pain have uniformly demonstrated efficacy superior to that of placebo and similar to that of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. However, controversy surrounding the proper place of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors in the hierarchy of treatment for arthritis continues, based primarily on their higher cost compared with that of acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. A decreased risk of gastrointestinal toxicity remains the primary justification for using the more expensive cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors in preference to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The renal and cardiovascular effects of rofecoxib and celecoxib have been investigated in relation to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and to one another. The data with respect to alteration in renal function, lower extremity edema, and hypertension indicates that cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors affect the kidney in a manner similar to that of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The data comparing the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors is difficult to interpret because it is not clear that comparable doses have been used in clinical trials.

Based on our results, the majority of prostate cancer patients do not express the appropriate antigen. Therefore, efforts to preselect the subset of prostate cancer patients with Tn-positive tumors or apply Tn vaccines to other cancers with higher rates of antigen expression could significantly improve clinical response rates.

Overall, the mean reduction was 1.94 log CFU (range, 1.83 to 2.10 log CFU) with the antimicrobial soap and 2.22 log CFU (range, 1.91 to 2.54 log CFU) with the bland soap. Overall, lather time significantly influenced efficacy in one scenario, in which a 0.5-log greater reduction was observed after 20 s with bland soap compared with the baseline wash (P = 0.020). Water temperature as high as 38\\xb0C (100\\xb0F) and as low as 15\\xb0C (60\\xb0F) did not have a significant effect on the reduction of bacteria during hand washing; however, the energy usage differed between these temperatures. No significant differences were observed in mean log reductions experienced by men and women (both 2.08 log CFU; P = 0.988). A large part of the variability in the data was associated with the behaviors of the volunteers. Understanding what behaviors and human factors most influence hand washing may help researchers find techniques to optimize the effectiveness of hand washing.', 17582631: 'Safety concerns surrounding the use of recombinant human erythropoietin (Epo) to treat anemia in cancer patients were raised after 2 recent clinical studies reported a worse survival outcome in patients who received epoetin alpha or epoetin beta compared with patients who received placebo. Although those findings contrasted with previous clinical studies, which demonstrated no difference in survival for cancer patients who received erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), some investigators have suggested a potential role for ESAs in promoting tumor growth through 1) stimulation of Epo receptors (EpoR) expressed in tumors, 2) stimulation and formation of tumor vessels, and/or 3) enhanced tumor oxygenation. The first and second hypotheses appeared to be supported by some EpoR expression and ESA in vitro studies. However, these conclusions have been challenged because of poor specificity of EpoR-detection methodologies, conflicting data from different groups, and the lack of correlation between in vitro data and in vivo findings in animal tumor models.

However, there are conflicting data concerning its role in programmed cell death and most results for its action as an inhibitor for neoplastic transformation are derived from experiments with epidermal cells. Therefore, we were interested to investigate if the action of Pdcd4 might be cell type specific. For that purpose we examined the expression of Pdcd4 and several other proteins in various tumor cell lines. We could not find any correlation of Pdcd4 levels and expression of proteins associated with cell cycle and/or apoptosis in different cell lines. Furthermore, we stably transfected two cell lines (Bon-1 and HCT116) to over-express Pdcd4 and analyzed protein expression. Although we found several regulated proteins none of these proteins were affected in both cell lines in the same manner. For instance, dUTPase expression was reduced in Bon-1 cells but not changed in HCT116 cells. This regulation might be important for the sensitivity of cells to anti-cancer drugs like inhibitors of thymidilate synthase. Therefore, we conclude that the function of Pdcd4 might be cell type specific. A role for Pdcd4 in apoptosis or as a tumor suppressor might be limited to certain cell types.', 24838701: StringElement('What is the relationship between semen parameters and mortality in men evaluated for infertility?', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'OBJECTIVE', u'Label': u'STUDY QUESTION'}), 10648110: 'The question of a connection between vaccination and autoimmune illness (or phenomena) is surrounded by controversy. A heated debate is going on regarding the causality between vaccines, such as measles and anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV), and multiple sclerosis (MS). Brain antibodies as well as clinical symptoms have been found in patients vaccinated against those diseases. Other autoimmune illnesses have been associated with vaccinations. Tetanus toxoid, influenza vaccines, polio vaccine, and others, have been related to phenomena ranging from autoantibodies production to full-blown illness (such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA)). Conflicting data exists regarding also the connection between autism and vaccination with measles vaccine. So far only one controlled study of an experimental animal model has been published, in which the possible causal relation between vaccines and autoimmune findings has been examined: in healthy puppies immunized with a variety of commonly given vaccines, a variety of autoantibodies have been documented but no frank autoimmune illness was recorded. The findings could also represent a polyclonal activation (adjuvant reaction). The mechanism (or mechanisms) of autoimmune reactions following immunization has not yet been elucidated. One of the possibilities is molecular mimicry; when a structural similarity exists between some viral antigen (or other component of the vaccine) and a self-antigen. This similarity may be the trigger to the autoimmune reaction. Other possible mechanisms are discussed. Even though the data regarding the relation between vaccination and autoimmune disease is conflicting, it seems that some autoimmune phenomena are clearly related to immunization (e.g. Guillain-Barre syndrome). The issue of the risk of vaccination remains a philosophical one, since to date the advantages of this policy have not been refuted, while the risk for autoimmune disease has not been irrevocably proved.

At 30 degrees C, the anomeric specificity of yeast hexokinase represented a mirror image of that of bovine hexokinase, in terms of both maximal velocity and affinity. A decrease in temperature apparently accentuated the anomeric difference in both maximal velocity and affinity of bovine hexokinase. Such a difference consisted in a higher maximal velocity with beta- than alpha-D-glucose, but a greater affinity for the alpha- than beta-anomer. In yeast hexokinase, however, the decrease in temperature suppressed the anomeric difference in maximal velocity and inversed the anomeric difference in affinity. In the case of both enzymes, the fall in temperature decreased more the maximal velocity recorded with alpha-D-glucose than that measured with beta-D-glucose, and severely lowered the Km for alpha-D-glucose, whilst failing to affect significantly the Km for beta-D-glucose. These findings, which allow to reconcile prior apparently conflicting data, reveal that the anomeric behaviour of hexokinase is affected by the ambient temperature. Our data also support the view that hexokinase underwent a phylogenic evolution in terms of its anomeric specificity.', 23805340: 'The prevalence of peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAD) in women and men is equal.

In addition to other measures, diagnosis is based on fine-needle aspiration cytology examination. Recently, new assays using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are being tested to improve sensitivity and specificity of primary diagnosis and detection of recurrent thyroid cancer. In the preoperative diagnosis of thyroid cancer, several tissue- and/or tumor-specific mRNA have been described and in several cases, a higher sensitivity and specificity could be achieved using molecular techniques compared to conventional methods. In the postoperative follow-up of patients with thyroid cancer, conflicting data have been published and the use of PCR techniques revealed several problems of the molecular approach, which are based on some technical as well as biologic limitations. Despite these problems, which are discussed in detail in this review, molecular techniques may nevertheless improve the sensitivity and accuracy of fine-needle aspiration of thyroid nodules, fine-needle aspiration of metastases, and detection of recurrent disease in peripheral blood samples.', 8694007: 'The concept of reperfusion-induced injury has aroused special interest during the past decade as thrombolysis and direct angioplasty were introduced for early restoration of coronary blood flow in patients with acute myocardial infarction.

Data from numerous animal experiments and clinical trials suggest that magnesium, a physiologic calcium blocker, may be efficacious for reduction of reperfusion injury. Despite encouraging results from previous clinical trials that revealed beneficial effects of intravenous magnesium therapy with respect to mortality, left ventricular function, and infarct size, a recently published large-scale trial (ISIS-4) provided conflicting data and caused major controversy.

We found no evidence of induction of laminin alpha1 chain protein or mRNA in dystrophic dy/dy skeletal muscle fibers as determined by immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, Northern blotting, or PCR analysis. Our data point to the need for additional immunological reagents specific for human laminin-alpha1 to resolve whether the conflicting data on laminin-alpha1 distribution in human and mouse tissues is due to species differences or, alternatively, due to differences in reagent specificity.

IGF-II plays a fundamental role in placental development and may play a role in gestational trophoblastic diseases. Several studies have shown that IGF-II is expressed at high levels in hydatidiform moles and choriocarcinoma tissues; however, conflicting data exist on how IGF-II regulates the behaviour of choriocarcinoma cells. The purpose of this study was to determine the contribution of the receptors for IGF-I and insulin to the actions of IGF-II on the regulation of choriocarcinoma cells metastasis. An Immuno Radio Metric Assay was used to analyse the circulating and tissue levels of IGF-I and IGF-II in 24 cases of hydatidiform mole, two cases of choriocarcinoma and eight cases of spontaneous abortion at the same gestational age. The JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cell line was used to investigate the role of IGF-II in the regulation of cell invasion. We found that mole and choriocarcinoma tissue express high levels of IGF-II compared to first trimester placenta. Both IGF-I and IGF-II regulate choriocarcinoma cell invasion in a dose dependent manner but through a different mechanism. IGF-II effects involve the activation of the InsR while IGF-I uses the IGF-IR. The positive effects of IGF-II on invasion are the result of enhanced cell adhesion and chemotaxis (specifically towards collagen IV). The actions of IGF-II but not those of IGF-I were sensitive to inhibition by the insulin receptor inhibitor HNMPA(AM)3. Our results demonstrate that the insulin receptor regulates choriocarcinoma cell invasion.', 20488631: 'Microsporum canis is the main pathogenic fungus that causes a superficial cutaneous infection called dermatophytosis in domestic carnivores. In cats, M. canis causes symptomatic or asymptomatic infection. Recent conflicting data raise the question of whether the clinical status of the infected cat (symptomatic or asymptomatic) is directly correlated to the proteolytic activity of M. canis strains. Here, the transcription of fungalysin and dipeptidyl-peptidase genes (DPP) of M. canis was compared between four strains isolated from symptomatic and asymptomatic cats during the first steps of the infection process, namely in arthroconidia, during adherence of arthroconidia to corneocytes and during early invasion of the epidermis, using a new ex vivo model made of feline epidermis. There was no detectable transcription of the fungalysin genes in arthroconidia or during the first steps of the infection process for any of the tested strains, suggesting that these proteases play a role later in the infection process. Among DPP, the DPP IV gene was the most frequently transcribed both in arthroconidia and later during infection (adherence and invasion), but no significant differences were observed between M. canis strains isolated from symptomatic and asymptomatic cats. This study shows that the clinical aspect of M. canis feline dermatophytosis depends upon factors relating to the host rather than to the proteolytic activity of the infective fungal strain.', 10979947: 'Two randomized, placebo-controlled trials previously showed that fluconazole (400 mg/d) administered prophylactically decreases the incidence of candidiasis in blood and marrow transplant (BMT) recipients. However, there exists conflicting data regarding the optimal duration of fluconazole administration, specifically whether prophylaxis through acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) results in improved survival in allograft recipients. Reported here are the results of long-term follow-up and a detailed analysis of invasive candidiasis and candidiasis-related death in 300 patients who received fluconazole (400 mg/d) or placebo for 75 days after BMT at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Patients in both treatment arms were compared for survival, causes of death, and the incidence of invasive fungal infections early (less than 110 days) and late (more than 110 days) after BMT. After 8 years of follow-up, survival is significantly better in fluconazole recipients compared with placebo recipients (68 of 152 vs 41 of 148, P =.0001). The overall incidence of invasive candidiasis was increased in patients who received placebo compared with fluconazole (30 of 148 vs 4 of 152, P <.001). More patients who received placebo died with candidiasis early (13 of 148 vs 1 of 152, P =.001) and late (8 of 96 vs 1 of 121, P =.0068) after BMT. The incidence of severe GVHD involving the gut was higher in patients who did not receive fluconazole (20 of 143 vs 8 of 145, P =.02), and fewer patients who received fluconazole died with this complication. Thus, administration of fluconazole (400 mg/d) for 75 days after BMT appears to be associated with decreased gut GVHD, a persistent protection against disseminated candidal infections and candidiasis-related death, resulting in an overall survival benefit in allogeneic BMT recipients.', 25170515: StringElement('There are conflicting data on the prevalence of coronary events and the quality of the management of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) in HIV-infected patients.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'BACKGROUND', u'Label': u'BACKGROUND'}), 26223189: StringElement('To identify the relationship between subclinical thyroid dysfunction and the risk of fracture, we conducted a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.

We conducted this study to analyse the clinical features of patients with pediatric SLE (pSLE) with onset in infancy, prepubertal and postpubertal age. The charts of patients followed at the Department of Pediatrics, University of Padua, who met the criteria for SLE diagnosis, were reviewed. Patients were divided into three groups based on age at disease onset: group A, patients < or =2 years old, group B patients aged between 2 and 10 years, group C patients between 11 and 16 years of age. The clinical and laboratory characteristics of each group were compared. Forty-two patients with pSLE entered the study: 2 were diagnosed before the age of 2 years, 11 between 2 and 10 years and 29 between 10 and 16 years. Eleven more patients with infantile (onset <2 years) SLE (iSLE) were found by a systematic literature search on PubMed and EmBASE and added for analysis to the group A. The female preponderance was significant only in postpubertal patients (F:M = 6.3: 1) whereas the other two groups presented a similar F:M ratio (1.2: 1). In comparison with the other two groups, iSLE showed a significantly higher prevalence of cardiovascular and pulmonary involvement, anemia and thrombocytopenia and a shorter disease duration at time of diagnosis. The postpubertal group showed a higher frequency of musculoskeletal involvement and leukopenia. In prepubertal patients there was no female preponderance and the frequency of clinical features was intermediate between infantile and postpubertal patients. Complement fractions level, antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-dsDNA, anti-cardiolipin antibodies and lupus anti-coagulant autoantibodies were not significantly different in the three groups. In general, the prevalence of internal organs involvement in pSLE seems to decrease with age. In infants, SLE is more severe than in the following ages. Postpubertal patients have a strong female preponderance and more specific signs of disease at onset. Prepubertal patients have an intermediate disease severity and no gender predilection.', 23861852: 'Erythropoietin (Epo) is a cytokine that binds and activates an Epo receptor (EpoR) expressed on the surface of erythroid progenitor cells to promote erythropoiesis. While early studies suggested EpoR transcripts were expressed exclusively in the erythroid compartment, low-level EpoR transcripts were detected in nonhematopoietic tissues and tumor cell lines using sensitive RT-PCR methods. However due to the widespread use of nonspecific anti-EpoR antibodies there are conflicting data on EpoR protein expression. In tumor cell lines and normal human tissues examined with a specific and sensitive monoclonal antibody to human EpoR (A82), little/no EpoR protein was detected and it was not functional. In contrast, EpoR protein was reportedly detectable in a breast tumor cell line (MCF-7) and breast cancer tissues with an anti-EpoR polyclonal antibody (M-20), and functional responses to rHuEpo were reported with MCF-7 cells. In another study, a functional response was reported with the lung tumor cell line (NCI-H838) at physiological levels of rHuEpo. However, the specificity of M-20 is in question and the absence of appropriate negative controls raise questions about possible false-positive effects. Here we show that with A82, no EpoR protein was detectable in normal human and matching cancer tissues from breast, lung, colon, ovary and skin with little/no EpoR in MCF-7 and most other breast and lung tumor cell lines. We show further that M-20 provides false positive staining with tissues and it binds to a non-EpoR protein that migrates at the same size as EpoR with MCF-7 lysates. EpoR protein was detectable with NCI-H838 cells, but no rHuEpo-induced phosphorylation of AKT, STAT3, pS6RP or STAT5 was observed suggesting the EpoR was not functional. Taken together these results raise questions about the hypothesis that most tumors express high levels of functional EpoR protein.', 11602525: \"In view of conflicting data in the literature regarding the enzyme(s) responsible for metabolism of selegiline, a drug used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, investigations were carried out in vitro using the human cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 recombinantly expressed in yeast to elucidate the enzyme specificity in selegiline metabolism. In the yeast microsomes used, desmethylselegiline and levomethamphetamine were formed from selegiline at significant rates. The highest contribution to the hepatic clearance of selegiline was calculated to be exerted by CYP2B6 (124 l/h) CYP2C19 (82 l/h), whereas CYP3A4 (27 l/h) and CYP1A2 (21 l/h) were of less importance. Antibodies against CYP2B6 inhibited metabolism of selegiline in microsomes containing CYP2B6 but not in microsomes without significant amounts of the enzyme. In contrast to previous reports, we could not find any role for CYP2D6 in the metabolism of selegiline. The data strongly indicate that the high extent of interindividual variation seen in vivo for selegiline clearance is caused by the metabolism of the compound by the highly polymorphic CYP2B6 and CYP2C19.\", 26577502: u'The results of this study imply that \\u03b2-methylamino-alanine (BMAA) obtained from extracts of blue mussels from the Swedish west coast is neither free nor protein bound. The results were obtained by separation (precipitation and ultrafiltration) of low and high molecular weight compounds from neutral extracts of blue mussels, and treatment of these extracts with low and high concentrations of acids, varying time and temperature. The main portion of BMAA was obtained from the low molecular weight fraction, released or formed at 95\\xa0\\xb0C in dilute acids. The measured amount of BMAA did not increase by strong acid treatment. Lysine was used as reference and was only released at significant amounts when treating the high molecular weight fraction with concentrated acid. The results also indicated that breakage of peptide bonds was not involved in the formation/release of BMAA in these extracts unless any BMAA peptide bond would be significantly more susceptible to dilute acid than e.g. the monitored lysine peptide bond. BMAA was measured using isotope dilution and detection of the underivatized compound by HILIC-UHPLC-MS/MS (Hydrophilic Interaction Liquid Chromatography, Ultra-High Performance Liquid Chromatography, tandem Mass Spectrometry).

This may be due to the pathophysiological alterations seen in the heart failure state leading to neurohumoral activation (stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, sympathoadrenergic stimulation), and due to the complications of therapy with diuretics, cardiac glycosides or ACE inhibitors. Patients with heart failure may exhibit hyponatremia due to a decrease in water excretion, which may be related to the enhanced release of both angiotensin and vasopressin and can be exaggerated by diuretic therapy. Along with potassium and calcium, magnesium influences cardiovascular function. Magnesium and potassium deficiencies play an important role in the development of cardiac arrhythmias. Magnesium is essential for the maintenance of intracellular potassium concentration. Although there are conflicting data regarding the prevalence of hypomagnesemia in patients with chronic heart failure (the values range from 7-37%), multiple studies have documented lower magnesium concentrations in patients with heart failure than in normal controls. As magnesium and potassium are mainly intracellular ions, measurements in serum or plasma are of limited value to assess magnesium status. There was no correlation between the intracellular electrolyte content and the electrolyte levels in plasma, either for mononuclear cells or erythrocytes or for myocardial and skeletal muscle. Loop diuretics (e.g. furosemide) are supposed to cause a substantial loss of both magnesium and potassium in the plasma and intracellular space. The potassium-sparing diuretics amiloride and triamterene are reported to also exert magnesium-sparing effects. Recently, ACE inhibitors have been documented to have important magnesium-conserving actions, possibly via their effect on glomerular filtration. Hyperkalemia, secondary to the use of ACE inhibitors in patients with heart failure, is well documented. Digoxin directly limits the renal tubular reabsorption of magnesium, therefore increasing magnesium excretion. Low magnesium and potassium concentrations increase cardiac glycoside toxicity. In contrast, elevated levels of magnesium decrease the sensitivity of human myocardium to antiarrhythmogenic actions of cardiac glycosides, without affecting maximally developed tension. Moreover, magnesium increases binding affinity of cardiac glycosides to the receptor. The antiarrhythmic action of magnesium is suspected to be mediated by a reduced sensitivity to electrophysiological changes induced by Ca2+, thus indicating Ca2+ antagonistic properties of magnesium. Magnesium deficiency has also been implicated in sudden death, notably in patients with congestive heart failure. Therefore, when treating congestive heart failure, one must consider how to prevent depletion of electrolytes or how to replete potassium and magnesium in deficiency states.', 19632736: StringElement('Circulating plasma DNA is present in a considerably higher concentration in lung cancer patients than in controls.

A significant interaction between gender and the course of ghrelin concentration was observed to the interval between 20:00 and 23:00 hours. In males a continuous increase of ghrelin levels before sleep onset was found. In females, however, a rise of ghrelin during the night was missed. We found a trend suggesting a lower time spent in stage I sleep in subjects with high nocturnal ghrelin levels.

As a result, conflicting data have been generated on the effectiveness of those therapies in certain conditions as acute myocardial infarction. As more academic medical centers and private companies move toward exploiting the full potential of cell-based medicinal products, needs arise for the development of the infrastructure necessary to support these investigations. This review describes the regulatory environment surrounding the production of cell based medicinal products and give practical aspects for cell isolation, characterization, production following Good Manufacturing Practice, focusing on the activities associated with the investigational new drug development.', 22221429: \"Allergic rhinitis (AR) is the most common chronic condition in pediatric populations. Characteristic symptoms in AR may bother daily activities and disturb sleep, leading to daytime inattention, irritability, and hyperactivity, which are also components of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Conflicting data exist in the literature regarding the relationship between ADHD and AR. The aim of this nationwide population-based study was to examine the prevalence and risk of ADHD among AR patients in a pediatric group. Data from a total of 226,550 pediatric patients <18 years old were collected from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database from January 1 to December 31, 2005 and analyzed. We calculated the prevalence of allergic diseases based on various demographic variables, as well as in ADHD patients. We also used multivariable logistic regression to analyze the risk factors of ADHD. In 2005, the period prevalence rates of atopy and ADHD in patients <18 years of age were 15.35 and 0.6%, respectively. Pediatric patients with AR had a substantially increased rate of ADHD (p < 0.001) in terms of period prevalence and odds ratio. This significance existed across various demographic groups regardless of age, gender, area, or degree of urbanization. Neither comorbidity of atopic dermatitis nor bronchial asthma carried high risk for ADHD in AR patients. The present study revealed an increased rate of ADHD among AR patients. Therefore, evaluation of ADHD is advised for treatment of AR children.\", 19602991: StringElement('Menopausal hot flashes may affect vascular function and perhaps explain conflicting data on cardiovascular disease (CVD) between observational and randomized hormone therapy (HT) studies.

Pharmacological tools to differentiate the seven P2X subunits are limited, hence localisation studies have examined their distribution. Such studies have provided conflicting data on the localisation of the P2X1 receptor subunit in the CNS. We therefore tested for the presence of the P2X1 subunit in the CNS, using tissue from P2X1 subunit knockout (KO) mice to test the antisera. There was no difference between the CNS of wild type (WT) and KO mice using anti-P2X1 in immunohistochemistry and Western blots. In contrast, the bladder reacted positively only in WT tissue. Thus the P2X1 subunit antibodies cross-react with non-P2X1 receptor proteins in the CNS. Antibody specificity tests should therefore be conducted in the specific tissue to be examined and on KO tissue where available.', 17656446: 'During acute and chronic inflammation visceral pain perception is altered. Conflicting data exist, however, on visceral pain perception in the postinflammatory phase. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether visceral pain perception is altered after resolution of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced inflammation of the colon. Visceral sensory function in mice was assessed by monitoring behavioral responses to intracolonic capsaicin instillation. Two hours later the number of c-Fos-positive neurons in lamina I/II and X of spinal cord segments T(12/13)-S1 was determined as a measure of neuronal activation. DSS colitis was induced by adding 1% of DSS to the drinking water. The course of DSS-induced colitis was assessed by determining the disease activity index score. Animals developed a transient colitis and had recovered at day 49. At this time point, cytokine levels and colon length were similar to control animals. Importantly, after resolution of DSS-induced colitis the behavioral response to intracolonic capsaicin was increased compared with control mice. Moreover, capsaicin-induced spinal cord neuronal c-Fos expression was significantly increased. Interestingly, after colitis animals also exhibited referred somatic hyperalgesia as measured with von Frey hairs on the abdominal wall. We conclude that postinflammatory visceral hyperalgesia occurs after resolution of DSS-induced colitis and that capsaicin-induced behavioral responses and spinal cord neuronal c-Fos activation are effective readouts for determination of visceral pain perception.', 26221183: 'Recently, there has been a problem of shortage of sleep laboratories that can accommodate the patients in a timely manner. Delayed diagnosis and treatment may lead to worse outcomes particularly in patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). For this reason, the prioritization in polysomnography (PSG) queueing should be endorsed based on disease severity. To date, there have been conflicting data whether clinical information can predict OSA severity. The 1,042 suspected OSA patients underwent diagnostic PSG study at Siriraj Sleep Center during 2010-2011. A total of 113 variables were obtained from sleep questionnaires and anthropometric measurements. The 19 groups of clinical risk factors consisting of 42 variables were categorized into each OSA severity. This study aimed to array these factors by employing Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process approach based on normalized weight vector. The results revealed that the first rank of clinical risk factors in Severe, Moderate, Mild, and No OSA was nighttime symptoms. The overall sensitivity/specificity of the approach to these groups was 92.32%/91.76%, 89.52%/88.18%, 91.08%/84.58%, and 96.49%/81.23%, respectively. We propose that the urgent PSG appointment should include clinical risk factors of Severe OSA group. In addition, the screening for Mild from No OSA patients in sleep center setting using symptoms during sleep is also recommended (sensitivity = 87.12% and specificity = 72.22%).', 7025282: 'Statistics on catastrophic head and neck injuries in football provide a more realistic indication of the incidence of serious injuries occurring on the football field than do the fatality figures. These statistics, however, provide no clues for preventing such injuries. Moreover, research using head models, anesthetized animals, cadaveric heads, and estimates of brain tolerance to impact based on studies of actual injuries to the heads of humans has produced conflicting data with respect to the goal of improving the safety record of the sport. To reconcile the data and to provide some solutions to the problem of serious injuries on the playing field, we reviewed the data collected in the laboratory and correlated it with the information obtained from telemetry studies. As a result of combining these two data sources, we concluded that injuries on the playing field occur at either end of the spectrum of offered resistance: when too much resistance is offered and when little or no resistance is offered. We demonstrated that, by avoiding either of these extremes, serious injuries to the head and neck can be reduced considerably. Finally, we discussed the importance of preprogrammed responses by the experienced, well-conditioned athlete. These allow the athlete to avoid either extreme of resistance and, thereby, protect him from injury. Clearly, the data obtained from laboratory and telemetry studies will prove instrumental in effecting changes in the sport of football. As a result of these studies, we can hope for alterations in the design of the helmet, enlightened coaching techniques, and rule revisions--all of which will serve to make football a safe sport.', 6353541: 'The relationship between pregnancy and epilepsy has often been object of particular attention and care by many epileptologists. The aim of this survey of the literature is to give an up-to-date and comprehensive review of this relation and to focalize the many related problems which still are unsolved. The following principal chapters are discussed: 1) the influence of pregnancy on epilepsy; 2) the influence of epilepsy on pregnancy and delivery; 3) the influence of epilepsy on newborns; 4) the teratogenic effects of antiepileptic medication. Many conflicting data make it very difficult to summarize the results, however it is clear that the effect of pregnancy on seizure frequency may be quite variable. Seizures, in fact, during pregnancy may be increased, decreased or remain unchanged. The most conflicting data are those related to the effects of epilepsy on pregnancy and delivery, while concordant opinions indicate an increased perinatal mortality and morbidity in offsprings of epileptic women. Special attention has to be payed to the offsprings of epileptic mothers. The presence of congenital abnormalities in fact, is about 2 times higher for newborns of mothers with epilepsy than for offsprings of mothers without the disease. Another important problem is related to the presumed teratogenicity of antiepileptic drugs. It has not yet been demonstrated that antiepileptic compounds have a teratogenic effect on offsprings. However it has been shown that this assumption is often associated to a higher presence of congenital malformations. The majority of malformations (facial clefts and heart defects) occur in association with the use of trimethadione, phenobarbital, primidone and acetazolamide, whereas they are much less frequent in association with phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproate.', 20716167: StringElement(\"DOG1 and protein kinase C (PKC) theta are both sensitive immunohistochemical markers of gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST).

There are conflicting data about the prognosis of these subtypes of high-grade endometrial carcinoma; this may be a result of lack of reproducibility in classifying tumor cell type. The purpose of this study was to examine differences in immunophenotype and outcome in a series of high-grade endometrial carcinomas, focusing on the comparison of EC-3 versus SC. We selected 180 endometrial carcinomas of SC, EC, or CCC type. No mixed carcinomas were included in the study. We chose the following immunohistochemical markers, estrogen receptor (ER), insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 3 (IMP3), p16, p53, progesterone receptor (PR), and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) as being significantly differentially expressed in endometrial carcinoma subtypes. The tumors were stratified into 4 groups on the basis of their cell type and grade: EC grade 1 or 2, EC-3, SC, and CCC. Univariate survival analysis revealed significant differences in outcome between the 4 groups (P<0.0001), with significantly longer disease-specific survival for grade 1 or 2 EC versus EC-3 (P=0.0001), and EC-3 versus SC (P=0.0003). p16, PTEN, and IMP3 expression was observed more frequently in SC compared with EC-3 (P<0.0001, P=0.021, and P=0.031, respectively). These 3 markers showed the highest sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing between EC-3 and SC, with receiver operating characteristics area under the curve of 0.85, 0.69, and 0.71, respectively. ER and p53 approached but did not reach significance for differential expression in EC-3 versus SC (P=0.055 and P=0.068, respectively). A combination of p16 and PTEN predicts EC-3 versus SC with a sensitivity of 90.0% and specificity of 96.8%. p16 and PTEN can aid in distinguishing between EC-3 and SC of the endometrium, and are superior to ER, PR, and p53 for this purpose.

They signal across the plasma membrane by interacting with serpentine receptors of the Frizzled (Fz) family and members of the low-density-lipoprotein-related protein (LRP) family. Activation of Fz-LRP promotes the stability and nuclear localization of beta-catenin by compromising the ability of a multiprotein complex containing axin, adenomatosis polyposis coli (APC) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) to target it for degradation and block its nuclear import. The Fz-LRP receptor complex probably accomplishes this by generating multiple signals in the cytoplasm. These involve activation of Dishevelled (Dsh), possibly through trimeric G proteins and LRP-mediated axin binding and/or degradation. However, individual Wnts and Fzs can activate both beta-catenin-dependent and -independent pathways, and Fz co-receptors such as LRP probably provide some of this specificity. Additional, conflicting data concern the role of the atypical receptor tyrosine kinase Ryk, which might mediate Wnt signaling independently of Fz and/or function as a Fz co-receptor in some cells.', 27914898: StringElement('Clinicians and treatment guideline developers are faced with a dilemma when the results of a new, large, well-conducted randomized controlled trial (RCT) are in direct conflict with the results of a previous systematic review (SR) and meta-analysis (MA).', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'BACKGROUND', u'Label': u'CONTEXT'}), 15325844: 'There are conflicting data about gender differences in cardiac function after myocardial infarction (MI), including cardiac rupture and mortality. Using a mouse model of MI, we recently found that the cardiac rupture rate during the first week after MI was significantly lower in females than in males, suggesting that females have attenuated structural remodeling. Thus in this study, we attempted to determine whether: a) females have attenuated remodeling and faster healing during the early phase post-MI, and b) females have better cardiac function and outcome during the chronic phase compared to males. MI was induced in 12-week-old male and female C57BL/6J mice. Signs of early remodeling, including cardiac rupture, infarct expansion, inflammatory response, and collagen deposition, were studied during the first 2 weeks post-MI. Left ventricular remodeling and function were followed for 12 weeks post-MI. We found that males had a higher rate of cardiac rupture, occurring mainly at 3 to 5 days of MI and associated with a higher infarct expansion index. Neutrophil infiltration at the infarct border was more pronounced in males than females during the first days of MI, which were also characterized by increased MMP activity. However, the number of infiltrating macrophages was significantly higher in females at day 4. During the chronic phase post-MI, males had significantly poorer LV function, more prominent dilatation and significant myocyte hypertrophy compared to females. In conclusion, males have delayed myocardial healing, resulting in cardiac rupture, and the survivors have poorer cardiac function and pronounced maladaptive remodeling, whereas females show a better outcome during the development of HF.', 22848149: 'Erythropoietin (Epo) is an essential hormone that binds and activates the Epo receptor (EpoR) resident on the surface of erythroid progenitor cells, thereby promoting erythropoiesis. Recombinant human erythropoietin has been used successfully for over 20 years to treat anemia in millions of patients. In addition to erythropoiesis, Epo has also been reported to have other effects, such as tissue protection and promotion of tumor cell growth or survival. This became of significant concern in 2003, when some clinical trials in cancer patients reported increased tumor progression and worse survival outcomes in patients treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). One of the potential mechanisms proffered to explain the observed safety issues was that functional EpoR was expressed in tumors and/or endothelial cells, and that ESAs directly stimulated tumor growth and/or antagonized tumor ablative therapies. Since then, numerous groups have performed further research evaluating this potential mechanism with conflicting data and conclusions. Here, we review the biology of endogenous Epo and EpoR expression and function in erythropoiesis, and evaluate the evidence pertaining to the expression of EpoR on normal nonhematopoietic and tumor cells.', 9493142: 'Calreticulin (CR) is widely recognized as a new human autoantigen but there are conflicting data concerning its relationship with the Ro(SS-A) ribonucleoprotein (RNP). Recent evidence suggests that CR binds to 52 kDaRo (Ro52) by a protein/protein interaction and binds to hY RNA and rubella virus RNA. Other studies have shown that initiation of immunity to either Ro52 or 60 kDaRo (Ro60) can lead to reciprocal spreading of autoimmunity to Ro60 or Ro52, respectively, and induce anti-La autoantibodies in some strains of mice. These findings support a physical association of these polypeptides in Ro/La complexes. To test the hypothesis that CR is physically associated with Ro52 and/or Ro60 we examined the sera of Ro52-, Ro60- and La-immunized mice for intermolecular spreading to CR. Immune sera from BALB/c and C3H/HeJ mice immunized with recombinant 6xHis-mouse Ro52, 6xHis-human Ro60 or 6xHis-human La were tested for reactivity by ELISA and immunoblotting with a full-length human CR protein expressed as a soluble maltose binding protein fusion protein (CR-MBP). Five of the six Ro52-immunized C3H/HeJ mice sera and all six Ro60-immunized C3H/HeJ mice sera reacted with the CR-MBP (but not a MBP control) on ELISA. In the BALB/c group, the responder rate was lower with one in six of the Ro52-immunized and one in five of the Ro60-immunized mice spreading to CR. In contrast, none of the BALB/c or C3H/HeJ mice which was immunized with La showed evidence of a recruited anti-CR antibody response. Immunoblotting of the different recombinant proteins with immune sera from the C3H/HeJ mice confirmed the specificity of the initial and recruited antibody responses. The spreading of immunity from Ro52 and Ro60 to CR in Ro-immunized mice suggests that a subpopulation of CR or CR-like molecules must associate under certain circumstances with Ro52 and Ro60 polypeptides in vivo, possibly as Ro/CR complexes concentrated in surface membrane blebs of apoptotic cells. The lack of spreading to CR in La-immunized mice suggests that CR may be associated with a subpopulation of Ro particles from which La has already dissociated.', 25516695: \"Three target-specific oral anticoagulants (TSOACs)-dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban-have been approved by the FDA to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation; however, no agents are currently approved to reverse the anticoagulant effects of these TSOACs in cases of active bleeding. This review discusses the benefits and risks of these TSOACs from a clinician's perspective, with a focus on the interruption of treatment for either elective or emergent surgery, monitoring, and reversal of anticoagulation. Available coagulation assays are not ideal for monitoring the effects of TSOACs and do not provide reliable quantitative measurement of their anticoagulant effects. When necessary, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) may provide qualitative information on dabigatran, and prothrombin time (PT) may provide qualitative assessment of the presence of the factor Xa inhibitors, rivaroxaban and apixaban. Current recommendations for reversal of TSOACs are based largely on limited and sometimes conflicting data from in vitro or in vivo animal models, and clinical experience with these recommendations is also limited. Methods that have been investigated for effectiveness for reversal of the pharmacodynamic effects of the TSOACs include dialysis, activated charcoal, prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), and recombinant activated factor VII. It is important to note that even within a class of anticoagulant drugs, compounds respond differently to reversal agents; therefore, recommendations for one agent should not be extrapolated to another, even if they are from the same therapeutic class. New antidotes are being explored, including a mouse monoclonal antibody to dabigatran; andexanet alfa, a potential universal factor Xa inhibitor reversal agent; and a synthetic small molecule (PER977) that may be effective for the reversal of factor Xa inhibitors and direct thrombin inhibitors. Given the short half-lives of TSOACs, watchful waiting, rather than reversal, may be the best approach in some circumstances.\", 9727673: 'Abnormalities of the P wave seen during sinus rhythm are associated with atrial fibrillation and other supraventricular arrhythmias. Intra-atrial conduction delays can be seen on the surface ECG as P wave prolongation, which is more visible with averaging techniques used in advanced recording devices. Averaging followed by amplification after proper filtering of the electrical signal should allow more precise measurements of duration and amplitude of the P wave. Data on reproducibility, filter settings, required number of beats, and precise definitions of onset and offset are dependent largely on the system used, which can be QRS or, preferably, P wave triggered. This explains conflicting data in the literature. It is clear that P wave duration is one of the best predictors of perioperative atrial fibrillation. For paroxysmal forms, the data are less convincing. Root mean square voltages of the P wave can be useful. Combining the P wave duration with other data often improves the diagnostic value of signal averaging. Standardization of the techniques appears to be necessary.', 18481818: 'Numerous clinical trials have established the value of antiplatelet therapies for acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Aspirin (ASA), thienopyridines (i.e., clopidogrel and ticlopidine) and GP IIb/IIIa antagonists comprise the major classes of antiplatelet therapies demonstrated to be of benefit in the treatment of ACS and for the prevention of thrombotic complications of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Clopidogrel is beneficial when administered before and after PCI, and is more effective when combined with either ASA or GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors in preventing post-PCI complications, coronary subacute stent thrombosis, and thrombotic events in general. It is currently unclear whether a higher loading dose of clopidogrel (600 mg) is better than the standard loading dose (300 mg), how long therapy should continue, and which maintenance dose is optimal. The role of the GP IIb/IIIa antagonists in ACS is less clear due to conflicting data from several studies with different patient populations. Currently, it appears that the use of GP IIb/IIIa antagonists might be most beneficial in high-risk ACS patients scheduled to undergo PCI, who demonstrate non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and elevated troponin levels.', 14641819: 'Idarubicin (IDA) is an anthracycline anticancer drug utilized in the treatment of acute leukemias.

Leukemia K562/R7 cells and sarcoma MES-SA/Dx5 cells expressing high levels of the MDR1 (ABCB1) gene were resistant to IDA (42-fold and 150-fold, respectively). In both of these cell lines, resistance to IDA was equivalent to that for doxorubicin, the drug used to select for the MDR variants. The P-gp inhibitor PSC 833 (valspodar) at 2 microM completely restored sensitivity to IDA. IDA accumulation was decreased 12-fold in MES-SA/Dx5 cells vs parental cell line, and drug uptake was restored to control levels by PSC 833. Reduced intracellular IDA was correlated with P-gp content by flow cytometry. Experiments in NIH3T3 murine cells transfected with the human MDR1 gene substantiated the findings of cross-resistance to IDA and reversal of resistance by PSC 833.

Formate and lactate were effective electron donors for the nitrosation reaction, which was inhibited by nitrate. Optimal growth conditions for the expression of nitrosation activity by various strains and mutants were determined. Highest activities were found with bacteria that had been grown anaerobically in a minimal medium rather than in Lennox broth, with glycerol and fumarate rather than glucose as the main carbon and energy source, and in the presence of a low concentration of nitrate. Bacteria harvested in the early exponential phase were more active than those harvested in later stages of growth. Well-characterized mutants defective in the synthesis of one or more anaerobically induced electron transfer chains were screened for nitrosation activity under these optimal growth conditions: only the respiratory nitrate reductase encoded by the narGHJI operon was implicated as a major contributor to nitrosation activity. Due to the limited sensitivity of the assays currently available, a minor contribution from the two alternative nitrate reductases or even other molybdoproteins could not be excluded. The role of formate in nitrosation was complex and was clearly not limited simply to that of an electron donor in the bacterial reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide: at least two further, chemical roles were inferred.

However, despite this possible relationship, few studies of good quality have been performed in humans. Comprehensive searches using Medline and reviewing relevant published bibliographies of English-language human and experimental literature concerning acute pancreatitis or pancreatic tissue and antibiotic therapy or pharmacokinetics were conducted. Ample experimental evidence indicates that aminoglycosides penetrate pancreatic tissue poorly and that penetration of penicillins is variable, although the relevance of this is debatable, because most tissue that requires debridement in severe pancreatitis is necrotic peripancreatic retroperitoneal fat, not the pancreas itself. Although several animal studies suggest that antibiotic prophylaxis would be beneficial in severe pancreatitis, two recent randomized studies of intravenous antibiotics in humans provide conflicting data. There are insufficient data to recommend the use of selective digestive decontamination. Some justification exists for the use of intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis in severe pancreatitis, but the data are insufficient to mandate prophylaxis or to elevate it to the standard of care. If chosen, prophylaxis with the combination of a fluoroquinolone plus metronidazole, or monotherapy with a carbapenem antibiotic, would be most appropriate.

Attempts at refining PSA have included attempts to correct the serum level relative to the size of the prostate (PSA density).

Current proteomic tools, such as the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), are based on protein abundance rather than protein activity and can result in conflicting data. To address this issue, we developed an assay in which ligand binding is detected using a microarray approach with immobilized antibodies on a porous aluminum oxide matrix. The galectin family of proteins was used as a model system to evaluate the performance of this approach. Galectins selectively bind galactosides and are linked to cancer progression. Our assay employed antibodies directed against different galectins. The antibodies were immobilized on the microarray surface by use of protein A/G. In our example, galectin-1 and galectin-9 were then detected in cell lysates. Lysates were exposed to the anti-galectin surface, followed by washing and quantification with a general fluorescent galectin ligand. The optimal galectin ligand allowed detection of nanogram amounts of galectin using only 1 \\u03bcg of antibody.

Therefore, targeted complement inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy. C1-esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) controls activation of the classical pathway (CP) and the lectin pathway (LP). However, conflicting data exist on inhibition of the alternative pathway (AP) by C1-INH. The inhibitory capacity of C1-INH for the CP is potentiated by heparin and other glycosaminoglycans, but no data exist for the LP and AP. The current study investigates the effects of C1-INH in the presence or absence of different clinically used heparinoids on the CP, LP and AP. Furthermore, the combined effects of heparinoids and C1-INH on coagulation were investigated. C1-INH, heparinoids or combinations were analysed in a dose-dependent fashion in the presence of pooled serum. Functional complement activities were measured simultaneously using the Wielisa(\\xae) -kit. The activated partial thrombin time was determined using an automated coagulation analyser. The results showed that all three complement pathways were inhibited significantly by C1-INH or heparinoids. Next to their individual effects on complement activation, heparinoids also enhanced the inhibitory capacity of C1-INH significantly on the CP and LP. For the AP, significant potentiation of C1-INH by heparinoids was found; however, this was restricted to certain concentration ranges. At low concentrations the effect on blood coagulation by combining heparinoids with C1-INH was minimal. In conclusion, our study shows significant potentiating effects of heparinoids on the inhibition of all complement pathways by C1-INH. Therefore, their combined use is a promising and a potentially cost-effective treatment option for complement-mediated diseases.', 9569056: 'The NM23-H1 gene product has been recently identified as a potential metastasis suppressor. Studies on breast carcinomas have shown an inverse correlation between NM23-H1 status and stage of carcinogenesis and overall survival. However, in colorectal cancer, conflicting data have been reported. This study aimed to investigate whether NM23-H1 immunostaining is correlated with tumour stage, overall survival, disease recurrence, tumour differentiation, age and sex in colorectal carcinomas for the Singapore population using chi-square analysis. The staining was performed on 141 paraffin-embedded surgical specimens collected between 1991 and 1992 using a monoclonal anti-NM23-H1 antibody. Follow-up of patients was until time of death or for 5 years. There was a very significant inverse association between tumour staging and NM23-H1 status (P = 0.0004). However, NM23-H1 expression was not significantly correlated to overall 5-year survival, disease recurrence, tumour differentiation, age or sex. Thus, although NM23-H1 may be involved in suppressing metastasis, NM23-H1 immunohistochemistry has no prognostic value in colorectal cancer. This is the first report of a significant inverse association of NM23-H1 status with tumour staging in colorectal cancer which showed no correlation with overall survival or disease recurrence. Our result thus cautions against the practice of equating an inverse relation of genetic markers with tumour staging to survival or disease recurrence.', 22160066: 'Hemophilia A is a rare bleeding disorder treated with numerous factor VIII (FVIII)-containing replacement concentrates. This treatment approach has led to the formation of alloantibodies that neutralize the FVIII activity (inhibitors) conveyed by these commercially available concentrates in ~ 25% of patients with severe hemophilia A (FVIII activity < 1% of normal). This phenomenon significantly complicates the treatment of these patients and compromises the effectiveness and efficiency of these products to reverse or prevent bleeding complications. Studying the population with alloantibody inhibitors is imperative but difficult due to the overall small number of individuals affected and the heterogeneity within this limited group. Furthermore, few randomized clinical trials have been conducted to answer pertinent questions so many controversies persist. This article focuses on the conflicting data on the variables associated with alloantibody FVIII inhibitor development with a particular emphasis on age and intensity of first treatment, the role of primary prophylaxis regimens in modulating this phenomenon, and the degree of purity of FVIII product as a potential contributing risk factor. The optimal dosing regimen and type of FVIII replacement product that should be used to achieve the highest success rate in immune tolerance induction (ITI) protocols are also discussed, as well as whether the addition of immunomodulatory agents, especially rituximab, to ITI regimens enhances the durability of ITI and the eradication of alloantibody FVIII inhibitors.', 17881795: 'Radiographic or silver halide film is a well-established 2D dosimeter with an unquestioned spatial resolution. But its higher sensitivity to low-energy photons has to be taken into consideration. Metal compensators or physical modulators to deliver intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) are known to change the beam energy spectrum and to produce scattered photons and contaminating electrons. Therefore the reliability of film dosimetry in compensator-based IMRT might be questioned. Conflicting data have been reported in the literature. This uncertainty about the validity of film dosimetry in compensator-based IMRT triggered us to conduct this study. First, the effect of MCP-96 compensators of varying thickness on the depth dose characteristics was investigated using a diamond detector which has a uniform energy response. A beam hardening effect was observed at 6 MV that resulted in a depth dose increase that remained below 2% at 20 cm depth. At 25 MV, in contrast, beam softening produced a dose decrease of up to 5% at the same depth. Second, dose was measured at depth using EDR2 film in perpendicular orientation to both 6 MV and 25 MV beams for different compensator thicknesses. A film dose underresponse of 1.1% was found for a 30 mm thick block in a 25 MV beam, which realized a transmission factor of 0.243. The effect induced by the compensators is higher than the experimental error but still within the accepted overall uncertainty of film dosimetry in clinical IMRT QA. With radiographic film as an affordable QA tool, the physical compensator remains a low threshold technique to deliver IMRT.', 27157188: 'The development of resistance to cisplatin (cDDP) is commonly accompanied by reduced drug uptake or increased efflux. Previous studies in yeast and murine embryonic fibroblasts have reported that the copper (Cu) transporters and chaperones participate in the uptake, efflux, and intracellular distribution of cDDP. However, there is conflicting data from studies in human cells. We used CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to individually knock out the human copper transporters CTR1 and CTR2 and the copper chaperones ATOX1 and CCS. Isogenic knockout cell lines were generated in both human HEK-293T and ovarian carcinoma OVCAR8 cells. All knockout cell lines had slowed growth compared to parental cells, small changes in basal Cu levels, and varying sensitivities to Cu depending on the gene targeted. However, all of the knockouts demonstrated only modest 2 to 5-fold changes in cDDP sensitivity that did not differ from the range of sensitivities of 10 wild type clones grown from the same parental cell population. We conclude that, under basal conditions, loss of CTR1, CTR2, ATOX1, or CCS does not produce a change in cisplatin sensitivity that exceeds the variance found within the parental population, suggesting that they are not essential to the mechanism by which cDDP enters these cell lines and is transported to the nucleus.', 27284165: 'The nontemplated addition of single or multiple nucleotides to RNA transcripts is an efficient means to control RNA stability and processing. Cytoplasmic RNA adenylation and the less well-known uridylation are post-transcriptional mechanisms regulating RNA maturation, activity, and degradation. Gld2 is a member of the noncanonical poly(A) polymerases, which include enzymes with varying nucleotide specificity, ranging from strictly ATP to ambiguous to exclusive UTP adding enzymes. Human Gld2 has been associated with transcript stabilizing miRNA monoadenylation and cytoplasmic mRNA polyadenylation. Most recent data have uncovered an unexpected miRNA uridylation activity, which promotes miRNA maturation. These conflicting data raise the question of Gld2 nucleotide specificity. Here, we biochemically characterized human Gld2 and demonstrated that it is a bona fide adenylyltransferase with only weak activity toward other nucleotides. Despite its sequence similarity with uridylyltransferases (TUT4, TUT7), Gld2 displays an 83-fold preference of ATP over UTP. Gld2 is a promiscuous enzyme, with activity toward miRNA, pre-miRNA, and polyadenylated RNA substrates. Apo-Gld2 activity is restricted to adding single nucleotides and processivity likely relies on additional RNA-binding proteins. A phylogeny of the PAP/TUTase superfamily suggests that uridylyltransferases, which are derived from distinct adenylyltransferase ancestors, arose multiple times during evolution via insertion of an active site histidine. A corresponding histidine insertion into the Gld2 active site alters substrate specificity from ATP to UTP.', 28245793: StringElement('Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in the critically ill patients and associated with a substantial morbidity and mortality.

Because apoptosis appears to be the predominant mode of tumor cell death after treatment with most antitumor drugs, and in the case of some drugs, the proclivity of the cell to undergo apoptosis varies depending on the cell cycle position, this study was aimed toward elucidating whether induction of apoptosis by AZC is cell cycle phase specific. Human promyelocytic leukemic HL-60 cells were treated with varying concentrations of AZC, and flow cytometric methods that identify apoptotic cels and provide information about the cell cycle distribution of the apoptotic and nonapoptotic cell populations were used. At 2-6 microM concentrations of AZC, the cells in the G1 phase preferentially underwent apoptosis, whereas the cells in G2-M were particularly resistant. Although incorporation of bromouridine into RNA was suppressed at that low AZC concentration, the rate of 5'-bromo-2-deoxyuridine incorporation into DNA was not significantly affected. At an AZC concentration of 8-40 microM, no cell cycle phase specificity in induction of apoptosis was apparent, but both the rate of 5'-bromo-2-deoxyuridine incorporation into DNA and bromouridine into RNA were reduced in proportion to drug concentration. The data suggest that the mechanism of cell killing by AZC may be different, depending on its concentration. Namely, whereas incorporation of AZC into RNA may play a predominant role in the induction of cytotoxicity of G1 cells at low drug concentrations, the perturbation of both RNA and DNA metabolism may be responsible for triggering cell death in the G1 and S phases, as is seen at higher concentrations of this antimetabolite.\", 2849485: 'Osteoclasts cultured from the endosteal surface of marrow appear to require osteoblasts for PTH to stimulate their resorptive activity, but the contribution of preosteoclasts to these observations has not been ruled out. Other data indicate that an osteoblast-derived factor can influence osteoclast activity, or confer sensitivity of osteoclasts to PTH. Acid phosphatase content of osteoclasts formed in osteoblast-free cultures of marrow cells is stimulated by PTH, but resorption is not. Also, there are conflicting data on the presence of a PTH receptor on osteoclasts. Thus, while PTH may act directly on preosteoclasts, or even on osteoclasts, to enhance resorptive capability, it seems evident that an osteoblastic factor mediates the PTH stimulation of osteoclastic resorptive activity.', 20351695: 'CD24 is a small, highly glycosylated cell surface protein that is linked to the membrane through a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor. It is overexpressed in many human carcinomas and its expression is linked to bad prognosis. Lately, lack or low expression of CD24 was used to identify tumor stem cells resulting in conflicting data on the usefulness of this marker. In many immunohistochemical studies, the mAb SN3b was used but the epitope and specificity of this antibody have never been thoroughly investigated. In other studies based mainly on cytofluorographic analysis, the mAb ML-5 was applied. In this study, we compared the epitope of mAb SN3b to the CD24 mAbs SWA-11 and ML-5 that both bind to the core protein of CD24. Using tissue microarrays and affinity-purified CD24 glycoforms, we observed only a partial overlap of SN3b and SWA11 reactivity. The mAb SN3b recognizes sialic acid most likely on O-linked glycans that can occur independently of the CD24 protein backbone. The SN3b epitope was not related to common sialylated cancer-associated glycan structures. Both SN3b epitope positive or negative CD24 glycoforms supported the binding of P-selectin and Siglec-5. In breast cancer, the SN3b reactivity was associated with bad prognosis, whereas SWA11 was not. In renal cell cancer, the SN3b epitope was completely absent but SWA11 reactivity was a prognostic factor. Our results shed new light on the tumorbiological role of CD24 and resolve discrepancies in the literature related to the use of different CD24 mAbs.', 21443280: 'Oesophageal cancer is the eighth most common cancer diagnosed worldwide, with almost half a million new cases diagnosed each year. Despite improvements in surgical and radiotherapy techniques and refinements of chemotherapeutic regimens, long-term survival, even from localized oesophageal cancer, remains poor. Surgical resection alone remains the standard approach for very early stage disease (stage I), but whilst surgery remains fundamental to the treatment of stage II-III resectable adenocarcinoma, multimodality therapy with chemotherapy or chemoradiation (CRT) is internationally accepted as the standard of care. Data from two large, randomized phase III trials support the use of perioperative combination chemotherapy in lower oesophageal and oesophagogastric junction adenocarcinomas, but the contribution of the adjuvant therapy is uncertain. There are conflicting data from randomized studies of a purely neoadjuvant approach; however, recent meta-analyses have demonstrated that chemotherapy or CRT given prior to radical surgery improves survival in patients with adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus. Neoadjuvant CRT but not chemotherapy alone is also beneficial for patients with squamous cell carcinoma. Definitive CRT has emerged as a useful option for the treatment of resectable squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus, avoiding potential surgical morbidity and mortality for most patients, with salvage surgery reserved for those with persistent disease. In this review, we focus on the pharmacotherapy of resectable oesophageal and oesophagogastric junction cancers and how clinical trials and meta-analyses inform current clinical practice.', 21189329: u'Even though myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, the molecular alterations that lead to marrow failure have not been well elucidated. We have previously shown that the myelosuppressive TGF-\\u03b2 pathway is constitutively activated in MDS progenitors. Because there is conflicting data about upregulation of extracellular TGF-\\u03b2 levels in MDS, we wanted to determine the molecular basis of TGF-\\u03b2 pathway overactivation and consequent hematopoietic suppression in this disease. We observed that SMAD7, a negative regulator of TGF-\\u03b2 receptor I (TBRI) kinase, is markedly decreased in a large meta-analysis of gene expression studies from MDS marrow-derived CD34(+) cells. SMAD7 protein was also found to be significantly decreased in MDS marrow progenitors when examined immunohistochemically in a bone marrow tissue microarray. Reduced expression of SMAD7 in hematopoietic cells led to increased TGF-\\u03b2-mediated gene transcription and enhanced sensitivity to TGF-\\u03b2-mediated suppressive effects. The increased TGF-\\u03b2 signaling due to SMAD7 reduction could be effectively inhibited by a novel clinically relevant TBRI (ALK5 kinase) inhibitor, LY-2157299. LY-2157299 could inhibit TGF-\\u03b2-mediated SMAD2 activation and hematopoietic suppression in primary hematopoietic stem cells. Furthermore, in vivo administration of LY-2157299 ameliorated anemia in a TGF-\\u03b2 overexpressing transgenic mouse model of bone marrow failure. Most importantly, treatment with LY-2157199 stimulated hematopoiesis from primary MDS bone marrow specimens. These studies demonstrate that reduction in SMAD7 is a novel molecular alteration in MDS that leads to ineffective hematopoiesis by activating of TGF-\\u03b2 signaling in hematopoietic cells.

As of June 2005, the National Institutes of Health and Food and Drug Administration suspended all clinical trials involving NSAIDs. This article reviews 30 prospective studies on the role of COX-2 selective inhibitors in the perioperative setting. The studies examined a variety of variables, including efficacy, perioperative opioid reduction, and effects on platelet aggregation and renal function. The data reveal an overall reduction in postoperative opioid use and significant patient satisfaction with perioperative COX-2 use, no effect on platelet aggregation, and a minor negative effect on renal function. The literature suggests that perioperative use of selective COX-2 inhibitors can be well tolerated and efficacious in carefully selected patient groups. Further data are needed to fully examine the role of these drugs in the perioperative setting. Intensive research into cardiovascular issues surrounding all NSAIDs is warranted.', 28429283: 'Hypospadiology is a rapidly evolving field. Progress in the understanding of how hormonal therapy affects the growth of the phallus has allowed surgeons to optimize the tissues for surgery. But conflicting data from a number of studies and a lack of consensus on drugs, their dosing, mode of delivery and timing of use means that the creation of protocols is unlikely to happen in the near future. Nonetheless, there is a hope and the standardization of scientific reporting will make it easier to compare data at the global level. There are reports of the increasing incidence of hypospadias and the etiology is thought to be multifactorial. Although complex interactions between genetic polymorphisms and the environment make it difficult to identify the exact factors responsible for hypospadias, the advent of massively parallel gene sequencing, large scale epigenetic screens and CRISPR technology will definitely ease the process. The knowledge of culprit genes will not only broaden our understanding of embryology and growth but will also enable us to predict and/or modify tissue healing. Advances in tissue engineering are also expected to provide a plethora of biomaterials for urethral reconstruction. The development of this field is directly linked with the elucidation of the processes of proliferation and vascularization coupled with the cataloguing of the growth factors involved. One can safely conclude that the exciting new advances in the field will have far reaching consequences on patient care and counselling.', 21422527: \"Some hypothesize that aging in humans is a cumulative process of macromolecular and mitochondrial damage starting years, even decades before any symptoms arise. Aging may begin when the rate of damage exceeds the rate of continual repair and turnover. Quality control for damaged mitochondria entails cellular digestion by mitophagy, a specialized kind of autophagy. Insufficient protective autophagy could cause damaged cellular components to accumulate over many years until they affect normal function in the cell. Alternatively, aging could be the result of overactive, pathologic autophagy. Current knowledge supports both hypotheses with conflicting data, depending on which stage of autophagy is examined. To distinguish these opposite hypotheses, two criteria need to be observed. First, is there a buildup of undigested waste that can be removed by stimulation of autophagy? Or second, if autophagy is overactive, does inhibition of autophagy rescue cell, organ and organism demise. Both of these are best determined by rate measures rather than measures at a single time point. Here, we review the generalized process of autophagy, with a focus on the limited information available for neuron mitophagy, aging, and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In two mouse models, treatment with rapamycin abolishes the AD pathology and reverses memory deficits. As a working model, we hypothesize that insufficient protective autophagy accelerates both aging and AD pathology, possibly caused by defects in autophagosome fusion with lysosomes.\", 28280619: StringElement('There are two distinct types of gastric carcinoma (GC), intestinal, more frequently sporadic and linked to environmental factors, and diffuse (undifferentiated) that is highly metastatic and characterized by rapid disease progression and a poor prognosis.

This feature presents a brief overview of the opportunities and challenges facing investigators who are seeking biomarkers that can predict those melanomas that are likely to result in progression (metastasis) and death. Melanoma metastasis to the regional lymph nodes is now readily identified by sentinel node biopsy. However, currently available prognostic factors, which are based on clinical parameters and histological findings in the primary tumor, are limited in their ability to reliably discriminate which patients will manifest sentinel node metastasis and/or disseminated disease. To date, even those biomarkers for which substantial clinical correlation has been obtained have suffered from both conflicting data in clinical trials involving different patient populations and poorly understood interactions between the biomarkers and other established prognostic factors. An understanding of whether biomarker data should be viewed as a continuum or be categorized based on discrete breakpoints is also frequently lacking. In many cases, biomarkers are initially developed based on unequivocal index cases, such as clearly benign or clearly malignant melanocytic lesions, but then fail as predictive tools when applied to the more difficult cases that arise in clinical practice; such cases occupy a 'gray' zone that is filled with uncertainty and lacks an established 'gold standard' against which a biomarker prediction can be validated.\", 3162887: 'Conflicting data have been reported on tumor marker determination in gastric juice. In the present study the effect of pH variations on both antibody-antigen binding and the immunologic stability of the antigen were evaluated for the radioimmunoassay of carcinoembryonic antigen, CA19-9, tissue polypeptide antigen, and ferritin. A significant inhibition of antibody-antigen binding was constantly found in acidic conditions. Antigen concentration was lower in acidified than in untreated samples, possibly due to the carryover of acidity in the incubation mixture. Neutralization of acidified samples partly improved recovery of carcinoembryonic antigen and CA19-9. Tissue polypeptide antigen and ferritin were not recovered by neutralization in samples with pH less than 4.5, suggesting an irreversible damage of the immunologic characteristics of the two antigens. From the present data we conclude that an accurate validation of methods and a rigorous standardization of sample collection are mandatory for tumor marker determination by radioimmunoassay in gastric juice.', 20539904: 'Conflicting data have been reported on the accuracy of protein S (PS) assays for detection of hereditary PS deficiency.

Several control groups were formed, one of healthy volunteers and - because PS levels are influenced by oral contraception and pregnancy, and assays measuring PS activity may be influenced by the presence of the factor V Leiden mutation -, we also investigated the influences of these factors. All nine PS assays detected significantly reduced PS levels in subjects with a PROS1 mutation. Eight out of nine PS assays showed a 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity to detect heterozygous carriers of mutations in PROS1 with values far below the lower limit of the reference values obtained from healthy volunteers. Low specificities were found in subjects with a factor V Leiden mutation and in pregnant women. At lower cut-off levels, equal to the highest PS value found in heterozygous carriers of mutations in PROS1, the specificity considerably increased in these subjects. When using low cut-off levels equal to the highest PS value found in heterozygous carriers of mutations in PROS1, ensuring 100% sensitivity, the specificity in all study groups increases considerably, by which misclassification can be maximally avoided.', 20562698: StringElement('To quantify the physical and chemical stability data published for commonly used continuously infused medications in the intensive care unit and to evaluate the quality of the studies providing these data.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'OBJECTIVE', u'Label': u'OBJECTIVE'}), 9843471: StringElement('There are conflicting data regarding whether the primary source of afferent input for the vagal cardiopulmonary reflex emanates from receptors located in the ventricles, atria, and/or lungs.

These include newer observations in animal models revealing augmentation of elastase-induced lesions by lathyrogens or by exposure to cigarette smoke. In general, the animal model experiments have focussed attention on repair-processes in the lung and shown that such processes may exert a major influence on the outcome of the initial proteolytic insult. Human studies exploring correlations between elastase levels in neutrophils or serum and development of disease have provided conflicting data; however, measurement of enzymes in pulmonary secretions have yielded more suggestive results. Assessments of lung elastase inhibitors in humans continue to support the importance of alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor in the protection of the lower respiratory tract, but newer information on locally produced, low molecular weight elastase inhibitors indicates that these, too, may play a significant role. Attempts have been made to link cigarette smoking to the development of emphysema at the chemical and cellular levels. These studies have focussed on: (1) the recruitment of elastase-producing leukocytes to smokers' lungs, (2) inactivation of lung elastase-inhibitors by tobacco products or by metabolites released from tobacco-stimulated lung cells, and (3) interference with elastin neosynthesis (repair) in the smoker. Additional information is also available concerning the biochemical properties of neutrophil and macrophage elastases, although it is still unclear which of these enzymes plays the predominant role in chronic lung injury associated with smoking. Perhaps the greatest advance in the emphysema field in recent years involves new discoveries concerning the structure and function of the alpha-1-proteinase (elastase) inhibitor. Applications of recombinant DNA technology and genetic engineering have made it possible to design modified inhibitors with striking new properties.

It affects an increasing number of children, adolescents and young adults exposed to the silent comorbidities of this disorder for a longer period. Infertility has arisen as one important comorbidity associated with the energy dysfunction promoted by obesity. Spermatogenesis is a highly regulated process that is determined by specific energetic requirements. The reproductive potential of males relies on hormonal-dependent and -independent stimuli that control sperm quality. There are conflicting data concerning the impact of male overweight and obesity on sperm quality, as well as on the possible paternal-induced epigenetic trait inheritance of obesity. In addition, it remains a matter of debate whether massive weight loss induced by lifestyle interventions, drugs or bariatric surgery may or may not benefit obese men seeking fatherhood. Herein, we propose to discuss how energy balance may modulate hormonal signalling and sperm quality in overweight and obese men. We also discuss some molecular mechanisms that mediate obesity-related dysfunction in male reproductive system and how paternal obesity may lead to trait inheritance. Finally, we will discuss how lifestyle modifications and sustained weight loss, particularly the loss achieved by bariatric surgery, may revert some of the deleterious effects of obesity in men and their offspring.', 22733595: u'Ligands of the B7 family provide both positive and negative costimulatory signals to the CD28 family of receptors on T lymphocytes, the balance of which determines the immune response. B7-H3 is a member of the B7 family whose function in T-cell activation has been the subject of some controversy: in autoimmunity and tumor immunity, it has been described as both costimulatory and coinhibitory, while in transplantation, B7-H3 signaling is thought to contribute to graft rejection. However, we now demonstrate results to the contrary. Signaling through a putative B7-H3 receptor prolonged allograft survival in a fully MHC-mismatched cardiac model and promoted a shift toward a Th2 milieu; conversely, B7-H3 blockade, achieved by use of a blocking antibody, resulted in accelerated rejection, an effect associated with enhanced IFN-\\u03b3 production. Finally, graft prolongation achieved by CTLA4 Ig was shortened both by B7-H3 blockade and the absence of recipient B7-H3. These findings suggest a coinhibitory role for B7-H3. However, experience with other CD28/B7 family members suggests that immune redundancy plays a crucial role in determining the functions of various pathways. Given the abundance of conflicting data, it is plausible that, under differing conditions, B7-H3 may have both positive and negative costimulatory functions.', 7949084: 'Lymphocyte predominance Hodgkin\\'s disease (LPHD) is a clinically indolent condition. Although there is evidence that the putative neoplastic cell in this disease, the \"L&H\" cell, is of B-cell lineage, there is conflicting data concerning the clonality of these cells. Our study was aimed at clarifying the issue of lineage and clonality of the L&H cells of LPHD using a single-cell assay. Four cases of LPHD were studied. To circumvent the difficulties of obtaining fresh tissue and to be able to study representative cases, a new method was developed to obtain single-cell suspensions of L&H cells from archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. Single L&H cells were identified by morphology and immunostaining for epithelial membrane antigen, isolated using a micropipette, and subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the complematarity determining region 3 (CDR3) of the Ig heavy chain (IgH) gene, which is B-cell clone-specific. The PCR products were size-fractionated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and representative products were directly sequenced. Single T cells and small B cells were also isolated from the tissues and used as negative and positive controls, respectively. In all four cases of LPHD, the IgH CDR3 of single L&H cells could be amplified. Within each case, the IgH CDR3 of single L&H cells was found to be of different length or of different sequence. Therefore, our results provide strong evidence for the B-cell origin of the L&H cells and the polyclonal nature of LPHD.', 9823005: \"The possible association between a high fat diet and increased breast cancer risk has remained controversial. This largely reflects the conflicting data obtained from migrant, case control and animal studies, which generally support this association, and cohort studies which often fail to show a link between fat and breast cancer. The mammary gland is particularly sensitive to estrogens during fetal development, leading us to hypothesize that dietary fat levels during this period may significantly influence breast cancer risk. Using chemically-induced mammary tumors in rats as our experimental model, we have demonstrated the ability of a maternal diet, high in the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) linoleic acid, to alter mammary gland differentiation, accelerate the onset of sexual maturation, and increase breast cancer risk. The mammary glands of female rats exposed to a high-fat diet in utero have more of the undifferentiated structures (terminal end buds) and fewer of the differentiated structures (alveolar buds) than the glands of rats exposed to a low-fat diet in utero. Furthermore, these mammary glands contain lower levels of total estrogen receptors and have reduced total protein kinase C activity. These effects appear to be mediated by an increase in the serum estradiol levels of pregnancy, which are elevated at least 30% in pregnant dams fed a high-fat diet. Furthermore, the administration of estradiol to pregnant dams produces effects on mammary gland development, onset of puberty and sensitivity to chemical carcinogenesis comparable to those seen in the offspring of rats fed a high fat diet during pregnancy. Our results, thus, support the hypothesis based on epidemiological data that high maternal estrogen levels increase daughters' breast cancer risk. The results also suggest that a high-fat diet may be an important factor in increasing pregnancy estrogenic activity.\", 18451232: StringElement('Survivin (BIRC5) is a promising tumor biomarker.

Investigations into the identity (or identities) of GRP94 surface receptors have yielded conflicting results, particularly with respect to CD91 (LRP1), which has been proposed to be essential for GRP94 recognition and uptake. To assess CD91 function in GRP94 surface binding and endocytosis, these parameters were examined in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell lines whose expression of CD91 was either reduced via RNA interference or eliminated by genetic disruption of the CD91 locus. Reduction or loss of CD91 expression abrogated the binding and uptake of receptor-associated protein, an established CD91 ligand. Surface binding and uptake of an N-terminal domain of GRP94 (GRP94.NTD) was unaffected. GRP94.NTD surface binding was markedly suppressed after treatment of MEF cell lines with heparin, sodium chlorate, or heparinase II, demonstrating that heparin sulfate proteoglycans can function in GRP94.NTD surface binding. The role of CD91 in the cross-presentation of GRP94-associated peptides was examined in the DC2.4 dendritic cell line. In DC2.4 cells, which express CD91, GRP94.NTD-peptide cross-presentation was insensitive to the CD91 ligands receptor-associated protein or activated \\u03b1(2)-macroglobulin and occurred primarily via a fluid-phase, rather than receptor-mediated, uptake pathway.

Here we propose a unifying theory of autism, the Intense World Theory. The proposed neuropathology is hyper-functioning of local neural microcircuits, best characterized by hyper-reactivity and hyper-plasticity. Such hyper-functional microcircuits are speculated to become autonomous and memory trapped leading to the core cognitive consequences of hyper-perception, hyper-attention, hyper-memory and hyper-emotionality. The theory is centered on the neocortex and the amygdala, but could potentially be applied to all brain regions. The severity on each axis depends on the severity of the molecular syndrome expressed in different brain regions, which could uniquely shape the repertoire of symptoms of an autistic child. The progression of the disorder is proposed to be driven by overly strong reactions to experiences that drive the brain to a hyper-preference and overly selective state, which becomes more extreme with each new experience and may be particularly accelerated by emotionally charged experiences and trauma. This may lead to obsessively detailed information processing of fragments of the world and an involuntarily and systematic decoupling of the autist from what becomes a painfully intense world.

Inhibitors of this enzyme are used in clinical practice to lower plasma cholesterol levels and are commonly collectively referred to as 'statins'. A number of in vitro, in vivo animal, and clinical studies suggest that properties of statins other than cholesterol lowering may be of biological importance. These diverse properties are often referred to as 'pleiotropic' and suggest that statins may affect a number of diseases of ageing. In this article we review the biological plausibility and clinical evidence of a role for statins in modulating two diseases of ageing: osteoporosis and dementia (including Alzheimer's disease). In both diseases, there is a sound cellular and laboratory basis for a plausible therapeutic effect of statins. In the case of osteoporosis, there are conflicting data regarding clinical benefit, with both negative and positive results reported. In particular, secondary analyses of randomised, controlled studies have shown no reduction of fracture risk by statins. In the case of dementia there are fewer clinical studies but there is clear anticipated benefit in macrovascular dementias attributable to statin-mediated reduction of the risk of stroke. Overall, there are a lack of prospective, placebo-controlled, randomised data testing statins and modulation of the risk of osteoporosis-related fracture or of clinical dementia, where these are primary outcomes. Until such data are available, the use of statins appears promising but cannot be recommended as a primary therapeutic modality for either condition.\", 20796219: 'Isoflavones are phytoestrogens that have pleiotropic effects in a wide variety of cancer cell lines. Many of these biological effects involve key components of signal transduction pathways within cancer cells, including prostate cancer cells.

Since randomized phase III trials of isoflavones in prostate cancer prevention are currently lacking, the best evidence for this concept is presently provided by case control studies. However, in vitro data are much more convincing in regard to the activity of a number of isoflavones, and have led to the development of genistein and phenoxodiol in the clinic as potential treatments for cancer.

BE can progress to esophageal dysplasia and adenocarcinoma; hence, early diagnosis and surveillance of BE and treatment of high-grade dysplasia leads to improved survival. The reported risk of developing cancer in BE ranges from 0.4 to 1.9%/year of follow-up. Most recent studies have tended to report rates of 0.5%/year or lower. Despite these data and concerns, at least two actuarial studies have suggested that the risk of death in patients with BE does not differ from that of a control population. This review of the literature focuses on the epidemiology of BE and the associated incidence of its sequelae.\", 21684021: \"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of neurodegenerative disease. The vast majority cases of AD are sporadic, without clear cause, and a combination of environmental and genetic factors has been implicated. The hypothesis that homocysteine (Hcy) is a risk factor for AD was initially prompted by the observation that patients with histologically confirmed AD had higher plasma levels of Hcy, termed hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), than age-matched controls. Most evidence accumulated so far implicates HHcy as a risk factor for AD onset, but there are also conflicting results. In this review we summarize reports on the relationship between HHcy and AD from epidemiological investigations, including observational studies and randomized controlled clinical trials. We also examine recent in vivo and in vitro studies of potential mechanisms whereby HHcy could influence AD development. Finally, we discuss possible reasons for the existing conflicting data and provide suggestions for future studies.\", 26192704: StringElement('Hypothalamic inflammation and gliosis are recently discovered mechanisms that may contribute to obesity pathogenesis.

We have investigated this question using thyroid epithelial lines as a model. We analysed (i) human thyroid cancer cell lines having either wild-type (wt) or mutant p53; (ii) rat thyroid lines derived by spontaneous immortalisation following introduction of mutant H-ras, which exhibit high levels of wt p53 but loss of p53-mediated cell-cycle control. Loss of response to TGF beta 1 was found in all human lines bearing mutant p53, and in the majority of the functionally equivalent rat lines, consistent with a role of wt p53 in mediating response. However, introduction of a dominant negative p53 mutant into TGF beta 1 responsive human lines containing wt p53 did not reduce responsiveness, demonstrating that p53 function is not necessary for TGF beta 1 response. On the other hand, expression of a temperature-sensitive (ts) p53 gene in a partially-responsive rat line demonstrated a highly significant modulation of TGF beta response, which fell from 65% inhibition of 3H-thymidine labelling index at 32.5 degrees C (wt p53 conformation) to only 14% at 37.5 degrees C (mutant conformation). The results suggest that p53 and TGF beta generate separate but interacting inhibitory signals, i.e. that p53 modulates but does not mediate TGF beta response. This conclusion explains previous conflicting data and is consistent with current models of cell cycle control by multiple inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases.', 16253764: 'Catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) plays an important role in the inactivation of biologically active and toxic catechols. It has been shown that human soluble COMT (S-COMT) is genetically polymorphic with a wild type and at least one variant in which a valine has been substituted with a methionine at codon 108. This polymorphism has been the subject of intense molecular epidemiological studies because of the important role of COMT in the metabolism of catecholamines and catechol estrogens. Several epidemiological studies have shown that women, homozygous with the Val108Met variant, have an increased risk of developing estrogen-associated cancers. However, some other studies have shown that this COMT polymorphism is not associated with increased risk of developing cancers. These conflicting data suggest that additional COMT genetic variants might contribute to the increased risk of developing cancers. Although two new single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) that cause amino acid substitutions Ala22Ser and Ala52Thr have been identified recently, they have not been fully characterized. In the present study, Ala22Ser and Ala52Thr variants of human S-COMT were produced using recombinant DNA techniques, and then COMT properties were measured including enzymatic activity, thermostability, and sensitivity to inhibition mediated by 4-hydroxyequilenin (4-OHEN). The Ala22Ser variant showed lower methylation capacity and higher thermolability. In addition, this variant is sensitive to 4-OHEN mediated irreversible inhibition. Our data indicate that the Ala22Ser polymorphism might also be of functional significance and might play a role in susceptibility to estrogen-associated cancers.', 22379333: \"There are conflicting data as to whether general or abdominal obesity is a better predictor of cardiovascular risk. This cross-sectional study involved 4,573 subjects aged 30 to 74 yr who participated in the Fourth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted in 2008. Obesity phenotype was classified by means of body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC), and participants were categorized into 4 groups. Individuals' 10-yr risk of coronary heart diseases (CHD) was determined from the Framingham risk score. Subjects with obese WC had a higher proportion of high risk for CHD compared to the normal WC group, irrespective of BMI level. Relative to subjects with normal BMI/normal WC, the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of normal BMI/obese WC group (OR 2.93 [1.70, 5.04] and OR 3.10 [1.49, 6.46]) for CHD risk in male were higher than obese BMI/obese WC group (OR 1.91 [1.40, 2.61] and OR 1.70 [1.16, 2.47]), whereas the adjusted ORs of obese BMI/obese WC group (OR 1.94 [1.24, 3.04] and OR 3.92 [1.75, 8.78]) were higher than the others in female. Subjects with obese BMI/normal WC were not significantly associated with 10-yr CHD risk in men (P = 0.449 and P = 0.067) and women (P = 0.702 and P = 0.658). WC is associated with increased CHD risk regardless of the level of BMI. Men with normal BMI and obese WC tend to be associated with CHD risk than those with obese BMI and obese WC.\", 10764769: 'In humans, growth hormone receptor (GHR) transcripts exist in two isoforms differing by the retention (GHRfl) or exclusion (GHRd3) of exon 3, whereas in mice GHRfl is solely expressed. This species-specific expression pattern is believed to result from an alternative splice event that, on the basis of conflicting data obtained in humans, has been considered to be tissue-, developmentally, and/or individual-specific. To decipher the molecular basis of this unusual trait, we isolated a 6.8-kilobase fragment spanning exon 3 from individuals expressing GHRfl. Sequence analysis revealed the existence of two 99% identical retroelements flanking this exon. Unexpectedly, individuals expressing GHRd3 displayed a 2.7-kilobase deletion involving exon 3, which most likely results from an ancestral homologous recombination between the two retroelements. The lineage of these retroelements during primate evolution revealed the species specificity of the GHRd3 allele. These findings led us to propose a model underlying the existence of the sole GHRfl allele in most species. Such a retrovirus-mediated alternative splice mimicry, which clears up several as yet unexplained phenomena (i.e. the above-mentioned expression data, the Mendelian inheritance of GHR expression patterns, and the deletion of nonconsecutive exons in growth hormone resistant patients), represents a novel physiological mechanism accounting for protein diversity between and within species.', 2833225: 'Lipase (triacylglycerol lipase, EC 3.1.1.3) activities have been reported previously in the lipid body and microsomal membranes of oilseed-rape (Brassica napus cv. Andor) seedlings, but conflicting data made it unclear whether there was one lipase in the lipid bodies, with the microsomal activity being attributable to fragments of lipid-body membrane, or if there were two separate lipase activities. In the present study, simultaneous characterization of the lipases under identical conditions showed they differed substantially in their pH-activity curves, kinetics and substrate specificities. (1) The kinetics of the microsomal lipase showed that the rate of lipolysis reached a plateau at concentrations above 5 mM, whereas the lipid-body lipase showed a linear increase in activity with substrate concentration up to 20 mM. (2) The pH optimum of the microsomal lipase was 7.5, whereas that of the lipid-body lipase was 9.0. The microsomal lipase was greatly inhibited at higher pH values, whereas the lipid-body lipase was much less affected. (3) Activity of the microsomal lipase was greatly diminished when substrates with longer chain length were used, and enhanced 4-fold if the substrates contained a single double bond. The lipid-body lipase was relatively unaffected by the type of fatty acid in the triacylglycerol.

Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of an EMCV strain isolated from an aborted swine fetus (EMCV 30/87) revealed that the virus had a poly(C) tract that was 7- to 10-fold shorter than the poly(C) tracts of other EMCV strains and 4-fold shorter than that of Mengo virus. Subsequently, we investigated the virulence and pathogenesis of this naturally occurring short-poly(C)-tract-containing virus in rodents, pigs, and nonhuman primates. Infection of C57BL/6 mice, pigs, and cynomolgus macaques resulted in similar EMCV 30/87 pathogenesis, with the heart and brain as the primary sites of infections in all three animals, but with different disease phenotypes. Sixteen percent of EMCV 30/87-infected pigs developed acute fatal cardiac failure, whereas the rest of the pigs were overtly asymptomatic for as long as 90 days postinfection (p.i.), despite extensive myocardial and central nervous system (CNS) pathological changes. In contrast, mice infected with >/==\" BORDER=\"0\">4 PFU of EMCV 30/87 developed acute encephalitis that resulted in the death of all animals (n = 25) between days 2 and 7 p.i.

Low immunogenicity or even an immune privileged status would enable their general use in allogeneic settings and therefore supply an unrestricted source. Based on conflicting data in terms of immunogenicity published for mouse and human ES-derived cells, the rat model was used to complement the knowledge in this specific area by a set of in vitro test systems using endothelial ES cell derivatives.This chapter describes the strategies and methods used to analyze immunogenicity of rat ES cell derived endothelial cells (RESC) in comparison to adult mature rat endothelial cells (EC). In a first characterization step, the endothelial nature of rat ES cell derived endothelial cells was proved by labelling with von Willebrand factor (vWF) as well as testing tube formation capacity on an extracellular matrix. The RESC can be characterized by their constitutive or cytokine-induced expression level of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) antigens class I and class II by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter (FACS) technology. Moreover, regulation of transcription factors involved in the IFN\\u03b3 signaling pathway could be evaluated by detecting either the phosphorylation status by specific intracellular antibody staining followed by flow cytometric measurement or by analyzing the mRNA expression level by quantitative RT-PCR. By stimulating the RESC with IFN\\u03b3 and coculturing with Carboxy-fluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFDA-SE)-labelled CD4(+) rat T cells, the ability of RESC to induce proliferation was analyzed by FACS technology. Allo-reactive cytotoxic T cells were generated in a mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) with lymph node cells from two MHC-disparate rat strains and used to determine the susceptibility of RESC to lytic processes. Therefore, RESC were labelled with calcein and the release of this fluorochrome after coculture was measured. To analyze the response to humoral attacks, RESC were incubated with allo-antibody containing sera and rabbit complement and then cell damage was assessed by 7-actinomycin D (7-AAD) incorporation into the DNA using FACS analysis.', 26200912: StringElement('The safety and efficacy of spinal fusion in the elderly population remains uncertain with conflicting data.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'BACKGROUND', u'Label': u'BACKGROUND'}), 28154706: StringElement('Several risk factors including stavudine and age have been strongly associated with polyneuropathy.

However, conflicting data have been reported with regard to the functional relevance of MDR1 allelic variants for the response to antiepileptic drugs. To our knowledge, it is not known whether functionally relevant genetic polymorphisms also occur in the two genes (Mdr1a/Abcb1a, Mdr1b/Abcb1b) coding for P-glycoprotein in the brain of rodents. Therefore, we have started to search for polymorphisms in the Mdr1a gene, which governs the expression of P-glycoprotein in brain capillary endothelial cells in rats. In the kindling model of temporal lobe epilepsy, subgroups of phenytoin-sensitive and phenytoin-resistant rats were selected in repeated drug trials. Sequencing of the Mdr1a gene coding sequence in the subgroups revealed no general differences between drug-resistant and drug-sensitive rats of the Wistar outbred strain. A comparison between different inbred and outbred rat strains also gave no evidence for polymorphisms in the Mdr1a coding sequence. However, in exon-flanking intron sequences, four genetic variants were identified by comparison between these rats strains. In conclusion, the finding that Wistar rats vary in their response to phenytoin, while having the same genetic background, argues against a major impact of Mdr1a genetics on pharmacosensitivity to antiepileptic drugs in the amygdala kindling model.', 17077077: 'New species and more specific strains of probiotic bacteria are constantly being sought for novel probiotic products. Prior to the incorporation of novel strains into food or therapeutic products a careful evaluation of their efficacy is required and an assessment made as to whether they share the safety status of traditional food organisms. Food organisms intrinsic to the production of traditional foods have been arbitrarily classified as safe in the absence of scientific criteria. Evidence for the safety and efficacy of probiotics has until recently been largely anecdotal or based on relatively little, and often poorly designed research. The demonstration of efficacy in probiotics offers vast opportunities for the development of human and veterinary products. The introduction of a new probiotic culture demands that it be at least as safe as its conventional counterparts. Many bacteria are being tested to find a putative probiotic, yielding conflicting data, sometimes for the same organism. Comparisons between studies and organisms cannot be readily made because of non-standardized dosing procedures. Information is not readily available on the equivalence of formulations for different probiotic preparations. There is vigorous debate on what constitutes appropriate safety testing for novel probiotic strains proposed for human consumption. Conventional toxicology and safety evaluation is of limited value in assessing the safety of probiotics. The addition of novel bacterial strains to foods and therapeutic products requires reconsideration of the procedures for safety assessment. This paper provides an overview of these issues.', 23536473: 'Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-derived prostaglandin E2 (PGE2 ) supports the growth of a spectrum of cancers. The potential benefit of COX-2-inhibiting non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for cancer treatment is however limited by their well-known cardiovascular side-effects. Therefore, targeting microsomal PGE synthase 1 (mPGES-1), the downstream enzyme in the COX-2-dependent pathway of PGE2 production might be attractive, although conflicting data regarding a potential tumor-supporting function of mPGES-1 were reported. We determined the impact of mPGES-1 in human DU145 prostate cancer cell growth. Surprisingly, knockdown of mPGES-1 did not alter growth of DU145 monolayer cells, but efficiently inhibited the growth of DU145 multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS). Opposed to MCTS, monolayer cells did not secrete PGE2 due to a lack of COX-2 expression, which was induced during spheroid formation. Pharmacological inhibition of COX-2 and mPGES-1 supported the crucial role of PGE2 for growth of MCTS. The functionality of spheroid-derived PGE2 was demonstrated by its ability to inhibit cytotoxic T cell activation. When investigating mechanisms of spheroid-induced COX-2 induction, we observed that among microenvironmental factors neither glucose deprivation, hypoxia nor tumor cell apoptosis enhanced COX-2 expression. Interestingly, interfering with apoptosis in spheroids triggered a shift towards necrosis, thus augmenting COX-2 expression. We went on to demonstrate that necrotic cells induced COX-2 mRNA expression and PGE2 secretion from live tumor cells. In conclusion, necrosis-dependent COX-2 upregulation in MCTS promoted PGE2 -dependent tumor growth and inhibited activated cytotoxic T cells. Hence, blocking mPGES-1 as a therapeutic option may be considered for COX-2/mPGES-1-positive solid cancers.', 17883994: 'Improvement of health-related quality of life (HRQL) is increasingly recognized as a priority in the management of heart failure (HF). In this review, we highlight the dramatic improvement in HRQL often observed in patients with severe HF and give particular emphasis to the nonpharmacologic therapy of cardiac resynchronization therapy, left ventricular assist devices, and cardiac rehabilitation. We juxtapose this to the less consistent improvement in HRQL seen with interventions aimed at treatment of acute HF syndromes. Conflicting data wherein HRQL improves in parallel to a detrimental or neutral effect on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are also presented. We conclude with future directions and make the case for HF-specific instruments intended for the assessment of HRQL in hospitalized patients, longitudinal studies in which HRQL is followed over time, and continued attention to the preferences of those with severe and acute HF.', 11160411: \"Conflicting data have been collected so far on the action of nitric oxide (NO) on cholinergic interneurons of the striatum. In the present in vitro electrophysiological study, we reported that intracellularly recorded striatal cholinergic interneurons are excited by both hydroxylamine and S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, two NO donors. This excitation persisted unchanged in the presence of glutamate, dopamine, and substance P receptor antagonists as well as after blockade of tetrodotoxin (TTX)- and calcium channel-sensitive transmitter release, suggesting that NO produces its effects by modulating directly resting ion conductances in the somatodendritic region of striatal cholinergic cells. The depolarizing effect of hydroxylamine was greatly reduced by lowering external concentrations of sodium ions (from 126 to 38 mm) and did not reverse polarity in the voltage range from -120 to -40 mV. The sodium transporter blockers bepridil and 3',4'-dichlorobenzamil were conversely ineffective in preventing NO-induced membrane depolarization. Intracellular cGMP elevation is required for the action of hydroxylamine on striatal cholinergic cells, as demonstrated by the findings that the membrane depolarization produced by this pharmacological agent was prevented by bath and intracellular application of two inhibitors of soluble guanylyl cyclase and was mimicked and occluded by zaprinast, a cGMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Finally, intracellular Rp-8-Br-cGMPS, a protein kinase G (PKG) inhibitor, blocked the hydroxylamine-induced membrane depolarization of cholinergic interneurons, whereas both okadaic acid and calyculin A, two protein phosphatase inhibitors, enhanced it, indicating that intracellular PKG and phosphatases oppositely regulate the sensitivity of striatal cholinergic interneurons to NO. The characterization of the cellular mechanisms involved in the regulation of striatal interneuron activity is a key step for the understanding of the role of these cells in striatal microcircuitry.\", 11504477: 'The antimalarial specificity of chloroquine (CQ) stems from the saturable uptake of the drug into malaria parasites. Strains of Plasmodium falciparum that are resistant to CQ have evolved a mechanism to reduce the saturable uptake of CQ and several biochemical models have been proposed to explain this. These include an efflux process analogous to multi-drug resistance (MDR) in cancer cells, reduced proton trapping due to elevated vacuolar pH, reduced binding to an intracellular receptor and reduced activity of a permease or drug importer. Here, we attempt to reconcile many of the apparently conflicting data used to support these models. Previous data are analysed in the context of our own model in which CQ uptake is determined by access of the drug to ferriprotoporphyrin IX (FPIX), the intracellular receptor.

Although several mouse models have been used to study the metabolic functions of PRL, a clear-cut consensus has not emerged given the limited and often conflicting data. To clarify the role of PRL in metabolic homeostasis in males and nonlactating females, we used the PRL-deficient mouse. Our objectives were to compare: 1) weight gain, 2) body composition, 3) serum lipid profile, 4) circulating leptin and adiponectin levels, and 5) glucose tolerance in PRL knockout, heterozygous, and wild-type mice maintained on standard chow, high-fat, or low-fat diets. In addition, we compared the lipolytic actions of PRL using adipose tissue explants from mice, rats, and humans. We are reporting that PRL deficiency does not affect the rate of weight gain, body composition, serum lipids, or adiponectin levels in either sex on any diet. Glucose tolerance was slightly impaired in very young PRL knockout male pups but not in adults or in females at any age. Leptin was elevated in male, but not female, PRL knockout mice maintained on a low-fat diet. PRL did not affect lipolysis in adipose tissue explants from mice but significantly inhibited glycerol release from both rat and human adipose explants in a dose-dependent manner. We conclude that PRL deficiency has negligible gross metabolic effects in mice.', 2653028: 'Atherosclerosis is an arterial disease characterized by localized accumulation of collagen, elastin, lipids, and calcium at sites associated with macrophage infiltration and altered smooth muscle metabolism. Studies in several types of animal models, especially cholesterol-fed rabbits, have shown that calcium competitors, calcium chelators, anticalcifying agents, and calcium antagonists can reduce the accumulation of atherogenic lesion components and decrease the progression of lesions. Although there are some conflicting data in the animal model studies, it is now apparent that several classes of calcium antagonists inhibit the progression of early arterial lesions induced by cholesterol-feeding in animals. The dihydropyridine class of calcium antagonists may be more potent as anti-atherosclerotic agents than the other classes. Mechanisms involving regulation of endothelial cell, smooth muscle cell, and macrophage metabolism may be responsible for the effects of calcium antagonists on early lesion progression. Recent studies in cell culture-model systems suggest that calcium antagonists may significantly alter activities that regulate lipoprotein-derived cholesterol accumulation by arterial wall cells. Some of these activities are independent of calcium flux across voltage-operated calcium channels. Thus, calcium antagonists may reduce the progression of atherogenic lesions by a combination of decreasing calcium accumulation within arterial wall cells and by altering calcium channel-independent metabolic activities, which affect lesion development.', 9436005: 'Beyond peptic ulcer disease, Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with intestinal-type gastric cancer and low-grade gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. It is also currently implicated as a possible cause of dyspepsia and extraintestinal disorders such as coronary artery disease, rosacea, chronic urticaria, and delayed growth in children. There are strong epidemiological data from large cohort studies linking H. pylori to gastric adenocarcinoma. Several cofactors, including early childhood acquisition of infection, strain-specific differences, genetic predisposition of the host, and the environment, appear to play a role in the progression of chronic gastritis to gastric cancer. H. pylori infection is seen in over 90% of MALT lymphomas, and about 70% of localized nonbulky tumors will undergo complete histological regression after eradication of the bacterium. Because follow-up data are limited to less than 2 years, those undergoing H. pylori eradication as primary therapy for MALT lymphoma require frequent histological surveillance for tumor recurrence. There are conflicting data from short-term studies regarding the effect of H. pylori eradication on dyspeptic symptoms. The decision to test or not for H. pylori in the dyspeptic patient may become easier when well-controlled studies with longer periods of follow-up become available. Because H. pylori induces a systemic inflammatory response, investigators are beginning to explore possible extraintestinal disease associations with the infection.

While most studies show activation of B cells, others have shown inhibitory effects. In the assay reported in this report, we were able to obtain widely diverse responses of human B-cell populations to anti-Ig antibody. An explanation of this variability was established by resort to an animal (murine) model. Mice maintained in a pathogen-free environment failed to respond or responded only weakly to anti-Ig antibody. Mice which had previously received heavy antigenic stimulation, but at the time of the experiment were not undergoing any known challenge, showed a marked positive response. Mice deliberately challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 24 hr prior to anti-Ig antibody exposure showed a high background mitogenesis in control cultures, which was inhibited by anti-Ig antibody. This preliminary study suggests that response to anti-Ig antibody differs in each phase of B-cell differentiation. In future studies it is hoped that this variability in response can be used to characterize different subsets of B-cell differentiation separated by physical or phenotypic parameters.', 15602544: 'Mice housed in standard cages show impaired brain development, abnormal repetitive behaviours (stereotypies) and an anxious behavioural profile, all of which can be lessened by making the cage environment more stimulating.

Indeed, clarification seems necessary in view of the abundance of often conflicting data currently emerging. However, given some simplifying assumptions, important patterns can be discerned. The following comments are thus framed in the context of haematopoietic cell lines, which generally undergo rapid apoptosis (within hours) following irradiation, in contrast to cells of non-haematopoietic origin, which are more likely to be characterized by delayed apoptosis (within days). Tolerance for DNA damage appears to be reduced in cells capable of rapid apoptosis, and those cells are sensitized to ionizing radiation when the apoptotic response mechanisms are fully functional. This rapid apoptotic response shows minor sensitivity to cell cycle position or radiation dose rate. Different considerations apply, however, for the delayed response. Delayed apoptosis appears to be triggered by chromosome damage, and evidence implicating delayed apoptosis as a modifier of cellular radiosensitivity is much less convincing at present.\", 25598834: UnicodeElement(u\"While HIV, AIDS and atypical Mycobacterium infections are closely linked, the use of Integrase-Inhibitor based cART, notably raltegravir-based regimens is more widespread.

While statins are similarly effective in secondary CVD prevention, some concerns raised by conflicting data reported in primary CVD prevention clinical trials. The small representation of women in clinical trials and the fewer rates of events due to the lower female baseline CVD risk may have conditioned contradictory meta-analysis findings.

Blood pressure normalisation (trough diastolic blood pressure < or = 90 mm Hg) had occurred in 29 to 50% of patients at the end of these investigations. The dose-response curve for spirapril appears to be flat for doses of 6 to 24 mg once daily. Comparisons with other ACE inhibitors are limited in number, and further studies are required before the relative antihypertensive efficacy of spirapril can be fully evaluated. However, in single, well controlled clinical trials, spirapril produced similar reductions in blood pressure to those seen with enalapril or captopril.

Data from small studies suggest that spirapril can be used without dosage adjustment in patients with renal impairment, as a consequence of its dual renal and hepatic clearance mechanisms. This is in contrast to most ACE inhibitors, which are eliminated by a predominantly renal mechanism that results in accumulation of the active metabolite when renal function is impaired. However, the utility of spirapril in this patient group has yet to be fully determined because of conflicting data regarding its effects on renal function. Thus, spirapril is an effective antihypertensive agent which is well tolerated. Further comparative trials are needed to fully determine its efficacy with respect to other ACE inhibitors, and a better understanding of its effects on renal function will clarify its role in hypertensive patients with renal failure.', 22244215: StringElement('The first cases of the European epidemic of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O104:H4 (STEC-O104:H4) infection were reported in Germany in April 2011.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'BACKGROUND', u'Label': u'BACKGROUND'}), 25766777: u'Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), is a major pathogen responsible for 1.5 million deaths annually. This bacterium is characterized by a highly unusual and impermeable cell envelope, which plays a key role in mycobacterial survival and virulence. Although many studies have focused on the composition and functioning of the mycobacterial cell envelope, the capsular \\u03b1-glucan has received relatively minor attention. Here we show that a murine monoclonal antibody (Mab) directed against glycogen cross-reacts with mycobacterial \\u03b1-glucans, polymers of \\u03b1(1-4)-linked glucose residues with \\u03b1(1-6)-branch points. We identified the Mab epitope specificity by saturation transfer difference NMR and show that the \\u03b1(1-4)-linked glucose residues are important in glucan-Mab interaction. The minimal epitope is formed by (linear) maltotriose. Notably, a Mycobacterium mutant lacking the branching enzyme GlgB does not react with the Mab; this suggests that the \\u03b1(1-6)-branches form part of the epitope. These seemingly conflicting data can be explained by the fact that in the mutant the linear form of the \\u03b1-glucan (amylose) is insoluble. This Mab was subsequently used to develop several techniques helpful in capsular \\u03b1-glucan research. By using a capsular glucan-screening methodology based on this Mab we were able to identify several unknown genes involved in capsular \\u03b1-glucan biogenesis. Additionally, we developed two methods for the detection of capsular \\u03b1-glucan levels. This study therefore opens new ways to study capsular \\u03b1-glucan and to identify possible targets for further research.', 24937339: StringElement('Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) frequently experience psychosocial complications in addition to physical illness.

However, conflicting data have been reported as well, mentioning the effect of a higher rate of immune-related toxicities during prolonged administration of the drug in responders. The review discusses the prognostic significance of autoimmunity during various forms of immunotherapy and stresses the importance of correcting for guarantee-time bias. In addition, other immune-related factors which have been associated with melanoma prognosis such as, CRP, white blood cell count, absolute lymphocyte count and human leukocyte antigen will be reviewed as well. A better understanding of the immune system and the host-tumor interactions should ultimately lead to more effective treatment.

Antidepressants from a number of pharmacological classes, including tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin or norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, as well as a number of atypical antidepressants and putative antidepressants, reduce response rate and increase reinforcement rate of rats under this schedule. These effects are observed acutely but persist or are augmented with repeated treatment. By contrast, drugs from a number of other psychotherapeutic classes do not, in general, produce similar effects. This includes anxiolytic, sedative, stimulant, opioid, antihistaminic, and anticholinergic drugs, which can produce false positive results in some preclinical tests for antidepressant efficacy. There are conflicting data regarding the utility of DRL behavior for discriminating the effects of antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs. This results in part from methodological differences among studies, but likely also reflects the overlap between the neuropharmacological and clinical effects of some antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs. DRL behavior also has proven useful for identifying neurochemical and neuroanatomical mediators of antidepressant effects on behavior. Consistent with clinical data, it appears that activation of noradrenergic or serotonergic systems provides for parallel means of producing antidepressant-like effects on DRL behavior. Finally, the results of studies using DRL behavior highlight important roles for central beta-1 adrenergic receptors, as well as 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2C receptors, in the mediation of antidepressant-like behavioral effects.', 10488705: StringElement('The prevalence and risks factors of bacteriuria in cirrhotics have not been assessed by case-control study, and there are conflicting data concerning the role of liver failure and of ascites.

The aim of the present study was to further evaluate peripheral and inferior petrosal sinus (IPS) serum PTHrP concentrations before and after CRH, in a group of consecutive patients with ACTH-dependent Cushing's disease. Nine patients with active ACTH-dependent Cushing's disease (8 women and 1 man, age +/- SD 41 +/- 13 yr) were submitted to peripheral and IPS sampling under fluoroscopic control before and after iv administration of CRH. All patients were subsequently submitted to transsphenoidal surgery and an ACTH-secreting microadenoma was found in all cases. In all patients, serum IPS and peripheral ACTH measurement were in keeping with the diagnosis of ACTH-dependent Cushing's disease. Serum PTHrP concentrations before and after CRH stimulation were below the sensitivity limit of the assay in all samples, and no gradient between IPS and peripheral sampling was observed.

Normal mature B cells constitutively express CD1d, but with the exception of some conflicting data, its expression in B-CLPDs is unknown. We demonstrate that in 222 B-CLPD cases, CD1d expression of less than 45% is strongly predictive of CLL (likelihood ratio, 32.3; specificity, 97.4%; sensitivity, 84.1%). In addition, CD1d showed significantly higher staining intensity in splenic marginal zone lymphoma compared with atypical hairy cell leukemia, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, and mantle cell lymphoma, thus allowing the discrimination of the former from the latter immunophenotypically overlapping B-CLPDs. It is important to note that in a given patient, CD1d expression on malignant B cells was similar between tissues and remained unaffected by disease stage and treatment status.

The latter is shown by the relatively greater increase in ventricular repolarization and higher incidence of torsades de pointes (TdP) in preparations from females by drugs blocking repolarizing K(+) currents. These results can be modulated by gonadectomy, suggesting that gonadal steroids are important determinants of gender difference in repolarization. In human subjects, QT and JT intervals are longer in women, whereas QT dispersion and Tp-e interval (the interval from the peak to the end of T wave) are longer in men. At slow heart rates greater prolongation in QT and increase in transmural repolarization heterogeneity (i.e. increase in Tp-e) may predispose to TdP tachycardias in women. In healthy postmenopausal women, hormone replacement therapy with estrogen alone usually produced a prolongation of QT interval, while estrogen plus progesterone had no significant effects on QT interval but reduced QT dispersion. Along with these, there are still conflicting data reported.

The studies had produced some conflicting data but (i) allowed the development of a number of reasonably satisfactory experimental models of convulsive epileptic seizures (ii) confirmed that such epileptic seizures arose from the cerebral cortex, and (iii) suggested that for local onset epileptic seizures to become generalised tonic-clonic ones, the opposite motor cortex and probably a brain stem, possibly pontine, centre needed to be involved. No generally acceptable animal model of chronic epilepsy had been developed, and the non-motor manifestations of epileptic seizures were still largely unexplored experimentally.

The incidence of ALS in European populations is two to three people per year per 100,000 of the general population. In Europe, crude prevalences range from 1.1/100,000 population in Yugoslavia to 8.2/100,000 in the Faroe Islands. Major advances have been made in our understanding of the genetic causes of ALS, whereas the contribution of environmental factors has been more difficult to assess and large-scale studies have not yet revealed a replicable, definitive environmental risk factor. The only established risk factors to date are older age, male gender and a family history of ALS. Median survival time from onset to death is usually 3 years from the first appearance of symptoms. Older age and bulbar onset are consistently reported to have poorer outcomes. However, there are conflicting data regarding gender, diagnostic delay and El Escorial criteria. The rate of symptom progression has been revealed to be an independent prognostic factor. Psychosocial factors and impaired cognitive function are negatively related to ALS outcome, while nutritional status and respiratory function are also related to ALS prognosis.

Here, we show that RANKL is expressed by primary multiple myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, whereas release of soluble RANKL was observed exclusively with multiple myeloma cells and was strongly influenced by posttranscriptional/posttranslational regulation. Signaling via RANKL into multiple myeloma and CLL cells induced release of cytokines involved in disease pathophysiology. Both the effects of RANKL on osteoclastogenesis and cytokine production by malignant cells could be blocked by disruption of RANK-RANKL interaction with denosumab. As we aimed to combine neutralization of RANKL with induction of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity of natural killer (NK) cells against RANKL-expressing malignant cells and as denosumab does not stimulate NK reactivity, we generated RANK-Fc fusion proteins with modified Fc moieties. The latter displayed similar capacity compared with denosumab to neutralize the effects of RANKL on osteoclastogenesis in vitro, but also potently stimulated NK cell reactivity against primary RANKL-expressing malignant B cells, which was dependent on their engineered affinity to CD16.

The mechanisms behind the altered NK functions are not clear, and conflicting data concerning NK and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity have been reported. In order to investigate whether this impairment is also observed at the clonal level and whether it is related to a defect at the target cell binding and/or the post-binding level, we evaluated highly purified NK cell lines and cloned NK cells obtained from 22 HIV-infected patients at different stages of disease and compared them with normal controls for their ability to: (i) kill K-562 and U-937 cell lines using a 51Cr release assay; (ii) bind and kill K-562 and U-937 cells at the single cell binding level; (iii) release NK cytotoxic factor (NKCF), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma); (iv) kill anti-IgM preincubated Daudi cell line (ADCC activity). This study with cloned NK cells or NK cell lines from HIV-infected individuals showed: (i) a decrease in their lytic capability against target cell lines; (ii) a low ability to form conjugates with K-562 and U-937 cell lines with respect to controls; (iii) a decreased ability to kill bound target cells; (iv) low levels of released NKCF, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma after incubation with U-937 cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that the impaired NK cell function during HIV infection is also observed at the clonal level and is related to defects both at the target and post-binding levels. However, the precise mechanisms remain to be determined. The inability to restore normal NK activity after long-term culture in the presence of high levels of recombinant IL-2 is in agreement with the hypothesis of a 'general anergic process' during HIV infection.\", 3732370: 'Twenty-four healthy volunteers participated in a study on the disposition of ergotamine following oral and rectal administration.

A closely related enzyme, protein geranylgeranyltransferase type I, carries out a similar modification of protein substrates containing a C-terminal Leu residue. Analysis of a mutant of protein farnesyltransferase containing a Tyr-to-Leu substitution at position 361 in the beta subunit led to the conclusion that the side chain of this Tyr residue played a major role in recognition of the protein substrates. However, no interactions have been observed between this Tyr residue and peptide substrates in the crystal structures of protein farnesyltransferase. In an attempt to reconcile these apparently conflicting data, a thorough kinetic characterization of the Y361L variant of mammalian protein farnesyltransferase was performed. Direct binding measurements for the Y361L variant yielded peptide substrate binding that was actually some 40-fold tighter than that with the wild-type enzyme. In contrast, binding of the peptide substrate for protein geranylgeranyltransferase type I was very weak. The basis for the discrepancy was uncovered in a pre-steady-state kinetic analysis, which revealed that the Y361L variant catalyzed farnesylation of a normal peptide substrate at a rate similar to that of the wild-type enzyme in a single turnover, but that subsequent turnover was prevented. These and additional studies revealed that the Y361L variant does not \"switch\" protein substrate specificity as concluded from steady-state parameters; rather, this variant exhibits severely impaired product dissociation with its normal substrate, a situation resulting in a greatly compromised steady-state activity.', 17349528: StringElement('The insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 receptor is currently being targeted in clinical trials in prostate cancer.

Conflicting data as to the role the sequences in the 3' NTR play in RNA replication have been reported. By using the HCV replicon system, which is based on the self-replication of subgenomic HCV RNAs in human hepatoma cell line Huh-7, we mapped in this study the sequences in the 3' NTR required for RNA replication. We found that a mutant with a complete deletion of the variable region is viable but that replication is reduced significantly. Only replicons in which the poly(U/UC) tract was replaced by a homouridine stretch of at least 26 nucleotides were able to replicate, whereas RNAs with homopolymeric guanine, adenine, or cytosine sequences were inactive. Deletions of individual or all stem-loop structures in 3'X were not tolerated, demonstrating that this region is most crucial for efficient RNA replication. Finally, we found that none of these deletions or substitutions within the 3' NTR affected RNA stability or translation, demonstrating that the primary effect of the mutations was on RNA replication.

Due to the existence of several molecules endowed with glucagon-like immunoreactivity, it was thought that the conflicting data could be related to the degree of specificity of the different glucagon antibodies. Three antibodies that all qualified as being specific for pancreatic glucagon were used. It was found that, depending on the antibody, absolute values of basal glucagonaemia or arginine-induced glucagon output varied quantitatively and qualitatively in both lean and obese rats. When non-extracted basal or stimulated plasma samples were passed on a G-50 Sephadex column, glucagon-like immunoreactivity was present over a wide range of molecular weights, indicating the presence of non-pancreatic glucagon molecules. When an ethanol extraction was used, the fractions eluting from the G-50 Sephadex column contained only pancreatic glucagon immunoreactivity. It is concluded that ethanol extraction is necessary for the measurement of the 3500 daltons glucagon. Using this methodology it was found that: (1) basal glucagonaemia was low but identical in the two groups of rats; (2) arginine-induced glucagon secretion was greater in obese than in lean animals; (3) glucagonaemia was decreased by glucose administration in lean but not in obese rats.

Angioprevention represents a mechanism of chemoprevention, yet conflicting data concerning the antiangiogenic action of metformin have emerged. Here, we clarify some of the contradictory effects of metformin on endothelial cells and angiogenesis, using in vitro and in vivo assays combined with transcriptomic and protein array approaches. Metformin inhibits formation of capillary-like networks by endothelial cells; this effect is partially dependent on the energy sensor adenosine-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) as shown by small interfering RNA knockdown. Gene expression profiling of human umbilical vein endothelial cells revealed a paradoxical modulation of several angiogenesis-associated genes and proteins by metformin, with short-term induction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), cyclooxygenase 2 and CXC chemokine receptor 4 at the messenger RNA level and downregulation of ADAMTS1. Antibody array analysis shows an essentially opposite regulation of numerous angiogenesis-associated proteins in endothelial and breast cancer cells including interleukin-8, angiogenin and TIMP-1, as well as selective regulation of angiopioetin-1, -2, endoglin and others. Endothelial cell production of the cytochrome P450 member CYP1B1 is upregulated by tumor cell supernatants in an AMPK-dependent manner, metformin blocks this effect. Metformin inhibits VEGF-dependent activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, and the inhibition of AMPK activity abrogates this event. Metformin hinders angiogenesis in matrigel pellets in vivo, prevents the microvessel density increase observed in obese mice on a high-fat diet, downregulating the number of white adipose tissue endothelial precursor cells. Our data show that metformin has an antiangiogenic activity in vitro and in vivo associated with a contradictory short-term enhancement of pro-angiogenic mediators, as well as with a differential regulation in endothelial and breast cancer cells.', 26622881: '50value was lower than that in TMZ-sensitive U-87 MG cells.

These studies were initiated on the premise that clonal expression of T cells at the site of inflammation could serve as a target for immune therapies designed on the basis of the option to inactivate or eliminate the presumed pathogenic T cells. These analyses have demonstrated the existence of a highly diverse overall TCR repertoire on the basis of extensive usage of TCR V genes both in synovial fluid and tissue. However, clusters of RA patients can be recognized who share increased usage frequencies of defined TCR V genes among synovial fluid or synovial tissue lymphocytes. Subsequent analysis of the CDR3 regions among diverse overall TCR repertoires have revealed the presence of conserved amino acid sequences in the CDR3 regions of the variable portions of TCRs in T lymphocytes derived from the site of inflammation. These findings suggest that a selective, antigen-driven expansion of T lymphocytes is occurring in the inflamed joints. Parallel to the TCR-repertoire studies, we investigated whether vaccines prepared from synovial T cells could modulate T-cell reactivity. The studies were based on previous work on TCV in animals, revealing that attenuated non-specific T-cell lines could serve as a vaccine. The results obtained in 13 RA patients showed no clear indication for a cellular or humoral immune response. Our experience with TCV in RA patients showed that this technique is feasible and safe. We found some evidence for a modulated T-cell reactivity both in vivo and in vitro. These results show at least some immunomodulatory effect af T-cell vaccination, although the antigen specificity of the effect of this intervention remains to be shown. Because of the convincing studies in animals and MS patients, further studies in RA should focus on the effect of vaccination using vaccines prepared from disease-inducing cells.

The tissue was examined histologically to assess development of the amphicelous centrum and to verify specificity of the stains. Our data confirm earlier claims about the development of the male and female characteristics in this species, and we provide for the first time direct embryonic evidence suggesting that development of the sexually dimorphic anal fin appendicular support is biphasic: (1) anteriorization of the most anterior caudal segments, and (2) growth and elongation of hemal arches of vertebrae 14-16. The first process involves a sequential homeotic transformation of hemal arches of vertebrae 11-13 through resorption of mineralized connective tissue, thus forming parapophyses that bear pleural ribs. This process begins in undifferentiated embryos and proceeds similarly in postnatal males and females. During the same period, the second process, likely induced by male gonadal hormones, causes the addition of mineralized connective tissue at the hemal arches of vertebrae 14-16. This second process, which occurs only in males, elongates the hemal arches of vertebrae 14-16 anteriorly. This elongation apparently translocates the anal fin appendicular support (including parts of the hemal spine of the hemal arch of vertebra 13) to the level of vertebra 11. It appears that the developmental programs of both female and male G. a. affinis create an area of 6 vertebrae which are markedly different from any vertebrae anterior to 11 and posterior to 16. We propose to term the area including these vertebrae and the associated anal fin, the genital area. We also propose that the first process, homeotic transformation of caudal into precaudal segments, is regulated by differential expression of control genes, such as homeobox genes, whereas the second process is regulated by gene expression under the control of male gonadal hormones.

The mean age in the former group was significantly higher than the controls. Patients with a prHBV infection never showed detectable HBV DNA serum levels or antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen/hepatitis B surface antigen seroreversion. However, when the prevalence of elevated amino transferases in patients with prHBV infection was compared to controls, it was significantly higher in the former group only for aminotransferase levels >1\\xd7 upper normal limit but not when aminotransferase levels >2\\xd7 upper normal limit were considered.', attributes={u'Label': u'UNLABELLED'}), 16413609: 'The mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and the enzyme 11betahydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2, which confers aldosterone specificity to the MR, are present in endothelium and vascular smooth muscle. In several pathological conditions aldosterone promotes vascular damage by formation of reactive oxygen species. The effect of aldosterone on vascular function, however, is far from clear. By rapid non-genomic mechanisms aldosterone may cause calcium mobilization and vasoconstriction, or may stimulate nitric oxide formation through the PI-3 kinase/Akt pathway and thereby counteract vasoconstriction. Vasoconstrictor, vasodilator or no effects of aldosterone have been reported from studies on human forearm blood flow. Inhibition of MR with spironolactone improves endothelial function in patients with heart failure but worsens endothelial function in type 2 diabetic patients. The aim of the present review is to reconcile some of the apparently conflicting data. A key observation is that reactive oxygen and nitrogen species serve as physiological signaling molecules at low concentrations, while they initiate pathological processes at higher concentrations. The net effect of aldosterone, which stimulates ROS production, therefore depends on the ambient level of oxidative stress. Thus, in situations with low levels of oxidative stress aldosterone may promote vasodilatation, while at higher oxidative stress (high NaCl intake, pre-existing vascular pathological conditions, high oxygen tension in vitro) aldosterone is likely to be associated with vasoconstriction and oxidative damage, and in this setting inhibition of the MR is likely to be beneficial.', 26569642: StringElement('Prior studies of acute abdominal pain provide conflicting data regarding the presence of racial/ethnic disparities in the emergency department (ED).', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'BACKGROUND', u'Label': u'BACKGROUND'}), 15730503: 'The huge number of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) orphans is an important feature of the epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa. There are few and conflicting data on the effects of being orphaned on health and nutrition in the highly affected HIV endemic areas of Africa. This study reports findings from a cross-sectional survey on associations between orphan status and health and nutrition parameters in young children of urban Uganda. A high prevalence of orphans was reported from a central Kampala community, with 41% being attributed to HIV/AIDS. Although there was a higher prevalence of self-reported morbidity in orphans than non-orphans, there were no differences in reported treatment seeking behaviour and measured anthropometric parameters. Hence it seems that the extended family system still manages to care for young orphans. Paying school fees for older children should be the primary target for HIV/AIDS impact mitigation programs in urban Uganda.', 12108719: 'Since trophic status assessment of water quality is very important for the water resources management, the assessment results obtained from using only one parameter may easily mislead or bias the decision makers or managers. Even when using a multivariable index, how to determine the weights of all factors is debatable. In this research, one complementary evaluation method, self-organizing map (SOM), for diagnosing water quality has been used to develop a trophic state classifier and is illustrated with a case study of trophic status assessment for Fei-Tsui Reservoir in Taiwan. The historical database was collected from the management agency of Fei-Tsui Reservoir from 1987 to 1995. The results of SOM are compared with those of the Carlson index and Fuzzy synthetic evaluation, showing that the inconsistent records can be mapped to the conflicting data zone of the SOM output map. In addition, SOM creates a diagnostic axis on the map to express the trophic status of the water body. As long as the SOM model is well-trained, new records can be assessed and classified as either one of three trophic levels or speciarcases. If special water quality conditions are expressed on the SOM output, those data can reveal that either total phosphorus (TP) or chlorophyll A (chl a) is higher than usual.', 17646512: StringElement('There are conflicting data regarding clinical efficacy of acupuncture applied while patients are under general anesthesia.

No study has examined the influence of operator factors on the accuracy of ECE reporting. The primary aims of this study were, therefore, to examine how operator experience with esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and operator reporting times of capsule videos influenced test accuracy. Twelve cirrhotic patients presenting for EGD had same-day ECE performed. The gold standard for variceal grade was determined using a panel of experienced endoscopists. Six novice capsule endoscopists, blinded to results of EGD, subsequently reported capsule videos for each of the 12 patients.Novice capsule endoscopists accurately identified high-risk varices. The mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for identifying high-risk varices for the six operators was 0.88 \\xb1/-0.14. The mean sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values for identifying high-risk varices for the six operators were 83%, 93%, 82%, and 97%, respectively. Years of prior EGD experience were not associated with accuracy of capsule reporting (OR = 0.9, 95% CI [0.74, 1.08]; p = .26). Time spent reporting capsule videos was associated with accuracy of capsule reporting for high-risk varices using British Society of Gastroenterology criteria (OR = 1.33, 95% CI [1.05, 1.08]; p = .018). Novice capsule endoscopists are able to accurately identify high-risk esophageal varices. Time taken to report capsule videos, but not amount of prior EGD experience, influenced capsule report accuracy. These findings may have implications for the design of further trials and the cost-effectiveness of ECE screening of varices.', 26593438: u'Cellular signaling associated with cardiac \\u03b2-adrenergic receptors (\\u03b2-AR) is composed of coupled mechanism among \\u03b2 1-/\\u03b22-AR and Gs proteins with contribution of constitutive \\u03b23-AR coupling to Gi proteins. However, down-regulation of \\u03b2-ARs in the heart under pathological conditions is mediated with a signaling G proteins-included mechanism. Additionally, there are serious conflicting data on this field in literature yet. Although some of these conflictions are generally related with either experimental protocols for different approaches or different animal models. To treat cardiovascular disorders, generally, various types of \\u03b2-blockers are used while their action mechanisms are not fully known yet. Furthermore, although \\u03b2-blockers are generally used to block the activated \\u03b2-ARs, they can be used to scavenge free radicals under oxidative stress. Studies, in whole-system, organ or cellular levels, showed that some \\u03b2-blockers, including timolol, have protective-actions against increased oxidative stress in diseased heart via ROSscavenging. Additionally, it has been mentioned that some \\u03b2-blockers nicely prevented the development of heart failure in both experimental and clinical studies by restoring sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) release channels, RyR2. Since diabetic cardiomyopathy is recognized due to its diminished responsiveness to \\u03b21-AR agonist stimulation in the heart with an up-regulation of \\u03b2 3-AR, inducing a strong negative inotropic effect on left ventricular function, it has been shown that treatment of streptozotocin-diabetic rats with timolol provided a marked cardio-protection. Importantly, it has been also documented that timolol treatment-dependent cardio-protection in diabetic rats includes basically prevention of RyR2- hyperphosphorylation, which, in turn, block Ca(2+)-leakage from SR via scavenging oxidative agents to control redox-state of cardiomyocytes. This action of timolol in diabetic heart is very similar to other known antioxidants, such as N-acetylcysteine or selenium compounds. In this review article, antioxidant-like action of timolol in diabetic cardiomyopathy was summarized in way of comparison with the benefits obtained with other antioxidants in the similar animal model.', 22150070: \"Cortisol has major impacts upon a range of physiological homeostatic mechanisms and plays an important role in stress, anxiety and depression. Although traditionally described as being solely synthesised via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, recent animal and human studies indicate that cortisol may also be synthesised via a functionally-equivalent 'peripheral' HPA-like process within the skin, principally within hair follicles, melanocytes, epidermal melanocytes and dermal fibroblasts. Current data indicate that basal levels of cortisol within hair vary across body regions, show diurnal variation effects, respond to the onset and cessation of environmental stressors, and may demonstrate some degree of localisation in those responses. There are conflicting data regarding the presence of variability in cortisol concentrations across the length of the hair shaft, thus challenging the suggestion that hair cortisol may be used as a historical biomarker of stress and questioning the primary origin of cortisol in hair. The need to comprehensively 'map' the hair cortisol response for age, gender, diurnal rhythm and responsivity to stressor type is discussed, plus the major issue of if, and how, the peripheral and central HPA systems communicate.\", 10726329: StringElement('Epidemiological evidence indicates that depressed baroreflex sensitivity and heart rate variability are associated with reduced survival secondary to coronary heart disease as well as with an increased risk of developing coronary heart disease.

Six subjects consumed each product in a randomized crossover design, with serum EC concentrations monitored over 6 h post consumption. Areas under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) were similar among chocolate matrices. However, AUCs were significantly increased for BSMP and BNMP (132 and 143 nM h) versus CMP (101 nM h). Peak serum concentrations (C(MAX)) were also increased for BSMP and BNMP (43 and 42 nM) compared to CDK and CMP (32 and 25 nM). Mean T(MAX) values were lower, although not statistically different, for beverages (0.9-1.1 h) versus confections (1.8-2.3 h), reflecting distinct shapes of the pharmacokinetic curves for beverages and confections. In vitro bioaccessibility and Caco-2 accumulation did not differ between treatments.

Two mammalian pathogens, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and vaccinia virus, exploit Nck as part of their infection strategy. Conflicting data indicate potential differences in the recognition specificities of the SH2 domains of the isoproteins Nck1 (Nckalpha) and Nck2 (Nckbeta and Grb4). We have characterized the binding specificities of both SH2 domains and find them to be essentially indistinguishable. Crystal structures of both domains in complex with phosphopeptides derived from the enteropathogenic E. coli protein Tir concur in identifying highly conserved, specific recognition of the phosphopeptide. Differential peptide recognition can therefore not account for the preference of either Nck in particular signaling pathways. Binding studies using sequentially mutated, high affinity phosphopeptides establish the sequence variability tolerated in peptide recognition. Based on this binding motif, we identify potential new binding partners of Nck1 and Nck2 and confirm this experimentally for the Arf-GAP GIT1.', 9395135: 'Experimental inoculation of mice provides a well characterized model for studying infection with tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), a flavivirus pathogenic for humans. Conflicting data on the kinetics of viremia and the development of virus titers in the brain, however, were only recently shown to have resulted from the use of assay systems with different levels of sensitivity in the titration of TBEV, i.e. plaque assay or sample transfer into naive recipient mice. Theoretically, RT-PCR could extend further the detectability to antibody-neutralized virus and when undertaken strand-specifically discriminate active replication from the mere presence of TBEV. We have compared the conventional methods for detection of TBEV with a newly devised RT-PCR method. As expected, RT-PCR, in contrast to the infectivity assays, detected antibody-neutralized virus. Furthermore, the mere presence or active replication of the virus could be differentiated by strand-specific RT-PCR. Plaque assay and sample transfer, in contrast, both detected only infectious virus. However, whereas sample transfer provides higher sensitivity for detection of TBEV from solid organs, the plaque assay is less costly and considering animals welfare more convenient. Thus, the newly devised method may allow the resolution of unanswered questions, while both the traditional infectivity assays retain their benefits in certain situations.', 26586050: 'Secondary hyperparathyroidism is almost a constant feature in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients maintained on hemodialysis (HD). Calcimimetic agents appear to offer an alternative to surgery in controlling secondary hyperparathyroidism in these patients. Recent studies provide conflicting data on the benefits, efficacy and tolerance of cinacalcet as first-line therapy for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in CKD. This study was designed to investigate the efficacy and tolerance of a low dose of the calcimimetic agent cinacalcet in patients on long-term HD having moderate to severe secondary hyperparathyroidism. Twenty five adult male patients on HD for more than three years were included in the study. All had moderate to severe secondary hyperparathyroidism with serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) >50 pmol/L, resistant to conventional treatment. We used the targets of Chronic Kidney Disease: Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) clinical guidelines as optimal target of serum iPTH, calcium and phosphate. Patients were administered cinacalcet as a single oral daily dose of 30 mg and were followed-up for six months. Cinacalcet treatment for six months resulted in a significant reduction in the serum phosphate and iPTH levels while the serum calcium levels remained unchanged. Thirty-six percent of the patients attained the recommended serum iPTH levels, 40% achieved significant reduction of the serum iPTH levels and 24% showed no favorable response. Only one patient dropped out because of severe gastrointestinal symptoms.

Their effectiveness to reduce (not cure) inflammation and related pain is without doubt. The problem is that of their side effects in particular of the GI-tract and other body systems. It is clear that these side effects occur more often and more seriously in a number of patients, the so-called high risk group: elderly women, patients with previous history of gastro-intestinal ulcer and corticosteroid users. The discovery that there are two pathways to influence cyclooxygenase activity and prostaglandin production and that some NSAIDs have a more marked COX-2 and COX-1 inhibition opens new perspectives. COX-1 is present in normal tissues and is responsible for the production of protective prostaglandins in the gastric mucosa and other tissues. COX-2 is induced by inflammatory cytokines and plays a role in the inflammatory cascade. Therefore more specific COX-2 antagonists should be safer for the gastro-intestinal mucosa and kidney function. The risk of hip fracture is 50% higher in patients receiving long-term corticosteroid therapy, and 30-35% of corticosteroid patients have vertebral fractures. The renewed interest in osteoporosis and increased number of papers on bone loss in RA reflect on the one hand the advances in technology to measure bone mineral density (BMD) accurately and precisely, and on the other hand the availability of effective drugs to stop bone loss and reverse the process. The possible deleterious effect of low dose corticosteroids continues to be a subject of concern, particularly in rheumatology where serum levels of free cortisone may be higher because of low albumen and other protein changes. Recently, several editorials and conflicting data obtained from cross-sectional and longitudinal studies in RA on steroid-induced osteoporosis have been published. Because the pathogenesis of steroid osteoporosis is distinct from that of entities such as postmenopausal osteoporosis, each therapy requires specific assessment in steroid treated patients. In recent years a wide variety of therapies, for example hormone replacement therapy, calcium supplements administered with vitamin D metabolites, thiazides, diuretics, anabolic steroids, tibolone, calcitonin and bisphosphonates, have been proposed to prevent osteoporosis in patients receiving longterm corticosteroid therapy, but there have been few carefully controlled trials, except for vitamin D and bisphosphonates.', 24548294: StringElement('Subclinical hypothyroidism (SH) is associated with increased risk for atherosclerosis, mainly attributable to dyslipidaemia and hypercoagulability.

The purpose of this study was to examine maximal exercise responses during acute and chronic administration of BB. Twenty-eight healthy males, 14 untrained (UT) and 14 involved in a personal training regimen (TR), performed maximal treadmill tests after 1 d and 9 d under three double-blind, randomized conditions: a placebo (PLAC), propranolol (PROP) 80 mg b.i.d., and atenolol (ATEN) 100 mg o.d. Maximal heart rate (HR), oxygen consumption (VO2), ventilation (VE), and treadmill time were significantly reduced by PROP and ATEN after an acute and chronic dose when compared to PLAC (P less than 0.05) in both groups of subjects. Maximal HR was decreased more after 1 d of BB than after 9 d of BB with both PROP and ATEN in the UT subjects and with PROP only in the TR group. VO2max, VEmax, and treadmill time were also less attenuated after 9 d of BB; however, this trend did not reach statistical significance. The nonselective beta blocker, PROP, caused greater reductions in VO2max compared to the selective beta blocker, ATEN, in both groups of subjects.

Receptors of both configurations mediate equally efficient conjugate formation between receptor grafted T cells and antigen-positive target cells. Specific signaling by the spacer containing receptor, however, is blocked by five- to 10-fold lower concentrations of soluble antigen than by the spacer-less receptor indicating a higher avidity of the spacer containing receptor to soluble antigen. In contrast, cellular activation upon binding to antigen-positive cells is mediated more efficiently by the spacer-less receptor.

Uniformly intratracheal surfactant administration caused a decreased intensity of mechanical ventilation during the first hours (reduced inspiratory pressure, reduced oxygen requirements) as an immediate effect of surfactant administration. Metanalysis reveals barotraumatic pulmonary complications mainly, pneumothorax and pulmonary interstitial emphysema to occur less frequently in surfactant-treated infants in virtually all trials; an increased incidence of survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia following surfactant treatment was observed in 10 controlled clinical trials. The incidence of other complications of prematurity (intracranial hemorrhage, patent ductus arteriosus and necrotizing enterocolitis) was unchanged following natural surfactant treatment. Dosing of natural surfactant is still under investigation, however recent data indicate that the initial dose should not be less than 100 mg/kg b.w. and retreatment should be given to infants with unsatisfactory response (i.e. fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) > 40%). Timing of surfactant treatment still remains controversial. Prophylactic treatment shortly following birth has been compared with rescue-treatment, i.e. surfactant administration to infants suffering from manifest RDS in most studies 4-8 h after birth. Conflicting data from 5 controlled trials may be interpreted as follows: prophylactic treatment seems to be favourable for extremely premature infants (GA < or = 26 weeks) and rescue treatment seems to be adequate for infants of 27-30 weeks of gestation. Intratracheal surfactant instillation in very premature infants did not result in an improved lung function for 24 h to 48 h in all patients. Ten--25% of study infants were reported to be \"non-responders\", i.e. infants without sustained decrease in oxygen requirements (i.e. FiO2 > 40%). Various factors may be operative including congenital bacterial infections (sepsis or pneumonia), lung hypoplasia and cardiac failure. Inactivation of surface properties of natural surfactant caused by a leakage of proteins across the alveolar-capillary membrane was observed in experimental and clinical studies. Current investigations focus on a combination of postnatal steroids and surfactant treatment to improve lung function and outcome in \"non-responders\". As long as any controlled clinical studies are being published, this approach remains experimental. Up to now, any controlled clinical trials have been performed to assess different modes of artificial ventilation (e.g. high frequency oscillating ventilation versus conventional ventilation) combined with surfactant therapy.

On this account one might expect a positive relationship between blood flow and structural similarity in areas involved in visual object recognition. Contrary to this expectation we report a negative relationship in that identification of articles of clothing cause more extensive activation than identification of vegetables/fruit and animals even though items from the categories of animals and vegetables/fruit are rated as more structurally similar than items from the category of articles of clothing. Given that this pattern cannot be explained in terms of a tradeoff between activation and accuracy, we interpret these findings within a model where the matching of visual forms to memory incorporates two operations: (i) the integration of stored object features into whole object representations (integral units), and (ii) the competition between activated integral units for selection (i.e. identification). In addition, we suggest that these operations are differentially affected by structural similarity in that high structural similarity may be beneficial for the integration of stored features into integral units, thus explaining the greater activation found with articles of clothing, whereas it may be harmful for the selection process proper because a greater range of candidate integral units will be activated and compete for selection, thus explaining the higher error rate associated with animals. We evaluate the model based on previous evidence from both normal subjects and patients with category-specific disorders and argue that this model can help reconcile otherwise conflicting data.', 4019157: 'Growth disturbances can occur following fractures of the femur or tibia in children. They can produce lengthening, shortening, axial and rotational deformities. The number of variable factors involved is such that valid statistical analysis demands a very large series of well documented cases followed up until growth ceases or stabilisation is established.

In the present limited survey of 174 the only statistically valid conclusions were that age and type of treatment are relevant factors in producing lengthening. In the other factors investigated the survey was not large enough to provide valid answers. It has been established that after metaphyseal or diaphyseal fractures in children disturbances of growth may occur resulting in accelerated growth, retarded growth, axial deformities and rotational deformities. The literature, although extensive, leaves many questions unanswered while on other matters, such as the role of certain factors in the pathogenesis of these disturbances, there is often conflicting data.

With this aim, the meta-analytic approach helped in the recent years to implement the quantification of the magnitude of the benefit of targeted agents, and added new insights by interpreting the data coming from clinical trials by integrating them with biomarkers. The treatment-interaction analyses according to putative predictive factors of efficacy may clarify unknown issues and generate new hypotheses for future perspectives.

Studies of G-CSF-mediated Stat3 signaling in cell culture and transgenic mice have yielded conflicting data regarding the role of Stat3 in myelopoiesis. The specific functions of Stat3 remain unclear, in part, because two isoforms, Stat3alpha and Stat3beta, are expressed in myeloid cells. To understand the contribution of each Stat3 isoform to myelopoiesis, we conditionally overexpressed Stat3alpha or Stat3beta in the murine myeloid cell line 32Dcl3 (32D) and examined the consequences of overexpression on cell survival and differentiation. 32D cells induced to overexpress Stat3alpha, but not Stat3beta, generated a markedly higher number of neutrophils in response to G-CSF. This effect was a result of decreased apoptosis but not of increased proliferation. Comparison of gene expression profiles of G-CSF-stimulated, Stat3alpha-overexpressing 32D cells with those of cells with normal Stat3alpha expression revealed novel Stat3 gene targets, which may contribute to neutrophil expansion and improved survival, most notably Slc28a2, a purine nucleoside transporter, which is critical for maintenance of intracellular nucleotide levels and prevention of apoptosis, and Gpr65, an acid-sensing, G protein-coupled receptor with pro-oncogenic and antiapoptotic functions.', 15143910: StringElement('Critically ill patients especially who require mechanical ventilation or have coagulopathy are at increased risk for stress-related gastrointestinal hemorrhage.

Although several structures surrounding the SCN are sensitive to the effects of gonadal steroids, similar effects in the SCN remain unclear. For example, there are conflicting data on whether the SCN is sexually differentiated. This study attempted to determine sex differences in the number of SCN cells generated during late gestation, and if testosterone mediates these differences. Pregnant female rats were treated with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU; 50 mg/kg) on gestational day 18 (E18), the day when aromatase activity peaks in the developing rat fetus. These animals were also given injections of oil or testosterone propionate (10 mg/0.1 mL peanut oil) from E15 until parturition. Litters were allowed to survive until adulthood and were killed on postnatal day 60 (PN60). Following fixation, brain sections containing the SCN from these rats were processed for BrdU immunocytochemistry. A second set of SCN sections was processed for immunocytochemistry detecting BrdU and some of the cell groups prevalent within the SCN. Data showed that female rats have a higher number of cells labeled with BrdU in the SCN, particularly in the medial and caudal SCN. This sex difference was abolished in animals treated with testosterone during late gestation. Double immunocytochemistry revealed that BrdU-labeled cells were neurons expressing calbindin-D28K, vasoactive intestinal peptide and, to a lesser degree, vasopressin. Our results unveiled a previously unknown effect of gonadal steroids on the developing SCN, which may contribute to the emergence of gender-specific circadian rhythms.\", 21722621: u'Challenges in measurement of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) protein expression have led to conflicting data on its prognostic value and discontinuation of its use for prediction of response. Herein is described a quantitative standardized assay for EGFR and its use in a series of retrospective cohorts of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The AQUA technology of quantitative immunofluorescence was used in conjunction with Western blot analysis to calculate the absolute concentration of EGFR in two independent NSCLC cohorts (170 from Yale New Haven Hospital and 335 from Sotiria and Patras Hospitals in Greece). EGFR and mutated EGFR were measured using D38B1 antibody and two mutation-specific antibodies. All patients positive or borderline for mutation-specific antibody were genotyped. A threshold for reproducible detection of EGFR was defined as 0.85 ng/\\u03bcg total protein. EGFR expression demonstrated no prognostic value in either cohort. The mutation rate was 1.79% in the Yale cohort, and 1.52% in the Sotiria/Patras cohort, with no antibody detection-based false-positive cases. No mutations were detected for EGFR concentrations <1.46 ng/\\u03bcg total protein. In summary, accurate measurement of EGFR still shows no prognostic value in NSCLC. In these two population-based cohorts, the antibody-based EGFR mutation rate was lower than has been frequently reported.', 23274480: u'Allergic rhinitis (AR) is common in children. Characteristic symptoms of AR may result in daytime inattention, irritability, and hyperactivity, which are also components of ADHD. Conflicting data in previous studies exist regarding the relationship between ADHD and AR. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence and risk of AR in ADHD patients in Taiwan. We conducted a cross-sectional study using the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. The study subjects included 469 patients who received psychiatric care for ADHD in 2005 and the general population (n = 220,599). Distributions of age, gender, and living areas as well as allergic diseases in the general population and in the ADHD group were examined by \\u03c72 tests. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to analyze the risk factors of AR. The prevalence of AR in ADHD group and the general population was 28.4 and 15.2%, respectively. The prevalence of asthma was 9.6% in ADHD group and 6.4% in the general population. Both the prevalence of AR (p < 0.001) and asthma (p = 0.008) was significantly higher in ADHD group than the general population. The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that ADHD patients had an increased rate of AR than general population (OR = 1.83; 95% CI = 1.48-2.27; p < 0.0001), and asthma was strongly associated with AR (OR = 9.28; 95% CI = 8.95-9.63; p < 0.0001). Our data showed that ADHD patients had an increased rate of AR. Therefore, psychiatrists should be more aware of the comorbidity of AR when treating ADHD patients.', 943089: 'Salt consumption was compared in two strains of rats, selected for their disparate proneness (strain \"H\") or resistance (strain \"N\") to Doca-salt hypertension. NaCl intake was similar in \"H\" and \"N\" rats prior to an following administration of Doca, while their respective blood pressures at the end of this experiment was 178 +/- 5mm Hg vs. 134 +/- 3 mm Hg. Thus, disparate responses of the blood pressure to Doca in the two strains cannot be ascribed to differences in salt intake. In another study, salt preference was tested in \"H\" and \"N\" rats by two-bottle self-selecting technique. Before Doca, saline preference in \"H\" rats averaged 60.3 +/- 5.8% of total daily fluid consumption, vs 18 +/- 4.2% in \"N\" rats. Following Doca treatment for 3 weeks the respective values were 96 +/- 1.7% vs 67 +/- 6.6%. Thus Doca treatment enhanced salt appetite in both strains, but salt preference remained significantly higher in the \"H\" rats. The increased susceptibility to hypertension and enhanced salt appetite in the \"H\" rat, corroborates similar reports in the Okamoto \"SH\" rat. In the Brookhaven \"S\" rat, however, susceptibility to hypertension is associated with salt avoidance. The conflicting data do not support a unified concept of a genetically determined link between salt appetite and proneness to hypertension.', 16126964: u\"Establishing the diagnosis of Sj\\xf6gren's syndrome has been difficult in light of its nonspecific symptoms (dry eyes and mouth) and lack of both sensitive and specific laboratory markers. Recently, antibodies against alpha-fodrin have been characterized: first in animal models of Sj\\xf6gren's syndrome, and later in humans. Antibodies against alpha-fodrin have been shown to be present in up to 98% of untreated patients. These antibodies are directed against an apoptotic cleavage product of alpha-fodrin. Anti-alpha-fodrin is clearly involved in the pathogenesis of murine models of Sj\\xf6gren's syndrome. However, in humans, conflicting data have recently been generated with regard to the prevalence of antibodies against alpha-fodrin in the disease. These differences may be caused by interference of treatment with antibody concentrations, but may also reflect varying methods of patient selection. Further studies on untreated patients are needed to establish the diagnostic efficiency of antibodies against alpha-fodrin in Sj\\xf6gren's syndrome, which may be a potential diagnostic marker in addition to antibodies against Ro. In this review, the potential of antifodrin antibodies as laboratory markers of Sj\\xf6gren's syndrome is discussed.\", 15735799: 'The role of C-reactive protein (CRP) in venous thromboembolism (VTE) is still under discussion because of controversial results in the literature. Conflicting data may have partly been due to bias by exogenous factors altering CRP levels. We investigated CRP concentrations in patients with spontaneous VTE applying a study design that allowed the measurement of basal high sensitivity (hs)-CRP levels. Patients with a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT, n=117) and pulmonary embolism (PE, n=97) were compared to healthy individuals (n=104). Hs-CRP levels (mg/dl) were significantly higher in patients (n=214, median/interquartile range: 0.171/0.082-0.366) than in controls (0.099/0.053-0.245, p=0.001). The unadjusted odds ratio (OR) for VTE per 1 mg/dl increase of CRP was 2.8 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1-6.8, p=0.03]. This association remained significant after adjustment for factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A and factor VIII activity above 230% (OR = 2.9, 95% CI [1.1-7.5]), but became remarkably attenuated and lost its statistical significance after adjustment for BMI alone (OR = 1.7 [0.7-4.0]). CRP was also not independently associated with VTE in subgroups of patients (those with DVT without symptomatic PE, those with PE and patients without established risk factor) in multiple regression analysis. In summary, we observed significantly higher basal hs-CRP levels in patients with spontaneous VTE compared to healthy controls. This association was independent of hereditary and laboratory risk factors for VTE, but lost its significance after adjustment for BMI. Increased basal CRP levels do not appear to represent an independent risk factor for VTE.', 19409913: StringElement('We recently demonstrated that non-toxic inhibition of the proteasome upregulates antioxidative enzymes and leads to an adaptive transcriptional pattern in endothelial cells.

Wnt signalling has been implicated in controlling BMSC fate, but the mechanisms are unclear and apparently conflicting data exist. Here we show that a novel glycogen synthase kinase 3\\u03b2 inhibitor, AR28, is a potent activator of canonical Wnt signalling using in vitro \\u03b2-catenin translocation studies and TCF-reporter assays. In vivo, AR28 induced characteristic axis duplication and secondary regions of chordin expression in Xenopus laevis embryos. Using human BMSCs grown in adipogenic medium, we confirmed that AR28-mediated Wnt signalling caused a significant (p<0.05) dose-dependent reduction of adipogenic markers. In osteogenic media, including dexamethasone, AR28 caused significant (p<0.05) decreases in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity compared to vehicle controls, indicative of a reduced osteogenic response. However, when excluding dexamethasone from the osteogenic media, increases in both ALP and mineralisation were identified following AR28 treatment, which was blocked by mitomycin C. Pre-treatment of BMSCs with AR28 for 7 days before osteogenic induction also increased ALP activity and mineralisation. Furthermore, BMP2-induced osteogenic differentiation was strongly enhanced by AR28 addition within 3 days, but without concomitant changes in cell number, therefore revealing BMP-dependent and independent mechanisms for Wnt-induced osteogenesis.', 27610107: 'The ubiquitous \"jack-of-all-trades,\" Aeromonas hydrophila, is a freshwater, Gram-negative bacterial pathogen under revision in regard to its phylogenetic and functional affiliation with other aeromonads. While virulence factors are expectedly diverse across A. hydrophila strains and closely related species, our mechanistic knowledge of the vast majority of these factors is based on the molecular characterization of the strains A. hydrophila AH-3 and SSU, which were reclassified as A. piscicola AH-3 in 2009 and A. dhakensis SSU in 2013. Individually, these reclassifications raise important questions involving the applicability of previous research on A. hydrophila virulence mechanisms; however, this issue is exacerbated by a lack of genomic data on other research strains. Collectively, these changes represent a fundamental gap in the literature on A. hydrophila and confirm the necessity of biochemical, molecular, and morphological techniques in the classification of research strains that are used as a foundation for future research. This review revisits what is known about virulence in A. hydrophila and the feasibility of using comparative genomics in light of this phylogenetic revision. Conflicting data between virulence factors, secretion systems, quorum sensing, and their effect on A. hydrophila pathogenicity appears to be an artifact of inappropriate taxonomic comparisons and/or be due to the fact that these properties are strain-specific.

It then specifically delves into the rather limited data for cardiovascular outcomes of those with low endogenous testosterone and those who receive TRT.

However, gastrin receptor ligands of the dipeptoid chemical series to which CI-988 belongs have been reported to act as agonists or antagonists towards gastrin-related events, depending on the animal model and the functional endpoint examined. To investigate further these apparently conflicting data, basal gastric acid secretion was monitored acutely in conscious monkeys given CI-988 orally at 10 mg/kg or intravenously at 0.01 mumol/kg/hr and histological changes in gastric mucosa were evaluated in monkeys given CI-988 orally at 5, 25 or 75 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks. Degeneration and atrophy of gastric glands occurred at 25 and 75 mg/kg with statistically significant decrements in gastric mucosal height at 75 mg/kg. In addition, CI-988 stimulated gastric acid secretion when given either orally or intravenously. Co-administration of the structurally unrelated CCK-B/gastrin antagonist L-365,260 completely blocked CI-988-stimulated acid secretion, confirming that CI-988's agonist effect on acid secretion is mediated by the gastrin receptor. Assuming that gastric mucosal degeneration is the result of inhibition of gastrin's trophic activity, CI-988 appears to induce paradoxical agonist and antagonist gastrin-receptor mediated effects.\", 16787286: 'An analysis of current literature on sexual dimorphism in response to trauma-hemorrhage revealed conflicting reports on the role of gender in outcomes of trauma patients. In contrast, results obtained from experimental studies clearly support the suggestion that gender plays a significant role in post injury pathogenesis. As discussed in this review, experimental studies suggest that the suppression of immune and cardiac function is severe in males and ovariectomized females; however, both immune and cardiac functions are maintained in proestrus females. Furthermore, findings from a number of studies have shown that the depletion of male sex hormones by castration or by blocking the interaction between male sex steroids and their receptors in males prevented the suppression of both immune and cardiac functions following trauma-hemorrhage. Moreover, administration of estrogen in males and ovariectomized females also prevented the suppression of immune and cardiac functions following trauma-hemorrhage. Thus, these experimental findings collectively suggest that female sex hormones (i.e., estrogen) produce salutary effects following trauma-hemorrhage whereas male sex steroids (i.e. 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone, 5alpha-DHT) are suppressive to immune and cardiac functions under those conditions. Such dramatic differences in the outcome of trauma-hemorrhage in proestrus females and males clearly suggest that the prevailing sex hormonal levels at the time of injury play a critical role in shaping the host response to trauma-hemorrhage. While a definitive cause for the conflicting data obtained in the clinical setting remains to be established, the discrepancy could be due to the differences in the hormonal levels at the time of injury. Since there is no information on hormonal status in the clinical studies, it is difficult to ascertain the role of sex hormones in post trauma pathogenesis. Therefore, in order to establish the role of gender in the outcome of trauma patients, more planned studies are needed in which the levels of sex hormones should be measured at the time of hospital admission. Furthermore, more studies, both in the clinical and experimental settings, should be performed to determine the mechanism by which the sex hormones improve immune and organ functions following trauma-hemorrhage. The findings obtained from these studies will help in designing innovative therapeutic approaches for the treatment of trauma patients.', 23006215: 'The public health burden of air pollution has been increasingly recognized over the last decades. Following the first assessed adverse effects on respiratory diseases and lung cancer, a large body of epidemiologic and clinical studies definitely documented an even stronger association of air pollution exposure with cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, particularly related to atherothrombotic (coronary and cerebrovascular) disease. Particulate matter (PM), mainly that with lower aerodynamic diameter (fine and ultrafine PM), is responsible for the most severe effects, due to its capacity to transport toxic substances deep into the lower airways. These effects have been shown to occur not only after short-term exposure to elevated concentrations of pollutants, but even after long-term relatively low levels of exposure. Vulnerable subjects (elderly persons and those with preexisting cardiopulmonary diseases) show the highest impact. Fewer and conflicting data also suggest an association with venous thromboembolism. Although not completely elucidated, a series of mechanisms have been hypothesized and tested in experimental settings. These phenomena, including vasomotor and cardiac autonomic dysfunction, hemostatic unbalance, oxidative stress and inflammatory response, have been shown to change over time and differently contribute to the short-term and long-term adverse effects of pollution exposure. Beyond environmental health policies, crucial for improving air quality and reducing the impact of such an elusive threat to public health, the recognition and assessment of the individual risk, together with specific advice, should be routinely implemented in the strategies of primary and secondary cardiovascular prevention.', 15557640: 'Staphylococcus aureus fibronectin-binding proteins (FnBPs) play a critical role in S. aureus pathogenesis. FnBPs mediate adhesion to fibronectin and invasion of mammalian cells, including epithelial, endothelial, and fibroblastic cells, by fibronectin bridging to the host cell fibronectin receptor integrin (alpha(5))beta(1). Strain Newman is a laboratory strain frequently used for genetic, functional, and in vivo studies. However, despite pronounced production of FnBPs, strain Newman is only weakly adherent to immobilized Fn and weakly invasive. We examined whether these effects are due to a structural difference of FnBPs. Here, we show that both fnbA(Newman) and fnbB(Newman) contain a centrally located point mutation resulting in a stop codon. This leads to a truncation of both FnBPs at the end of the C domain at identical positions. Most likely, the stop codon occurred first in fnbB(Newman) and was subsequently transferred to fnbA(Newman) by replacement of the entire region encompassing the C, D, and W domains with the respective sequence of fnbB(Newman). Using heterologous expression in Staphylococcus carnosus, we found that truncated FnBPs were completely secreted into the culture medium and not anchored to the cell wall, since they lack the sortase motif (LPETG). Consequently, this led to a loss of FnBP-dependent functions, such as strong adhesion to immobilized fibronectin, binding of fibrinogen, and host cell invasion. This mutation may explain some of the earlier reported conflicting data with strain Newman. Thus, care should be taken when drawing negative conclusions about the role of FnBPs as a virulence factor in a given model.', 11251884: 'Anti-Ro (or SSA) is found in the sera of patients with autoimmune rheumatic illnesses. All patients with anti-Ro defined by precipitation bind a 60 000 Da antigen (60 kDa Ro), whereas some patients also bind a 52 000 Da molecule (52 kDa Ro). In general, antibody binding is directed against native 60 kDa Ro and denatured 52 kDa Ro. The mechanism by which anti-52 kDa Ro arises in the setting of anti-60 kDa Ro is unknown. Conflicting data exist as to the existence of a physical interaction between the two proteins in cells and as to cross-reacting antibodies. Antibodies were affinity purified from a peptide within the leucine zipper region of 52 kDa Ro. These purified antibodies binding the 197-207 peptide from 52 kDa Ro (anti-52LZ) bound native 60 kDa Ro as well as denatured 52 kDa Ro. In addition, anti-52LZ also bound up to four regions from the sequence of 60 kDa Ro and a single conformational epitope of 60 kDa Ro. Thus, these primary sites represent components of the tertiary epitope. We hypothesized that if this was the case, these peptides making up a tertiary epitope would show molecular interaction. In fact, peptides from 60 kDa Ro have a molecular interaction with the 52 kDa Ro peptide as well as full-length 52 kDa Ro when assessed by surface plasmon resonance. The leucine-zipper region peptide from 52 kDa Ro bound three of the four peptides from 60 kDa Ro. These data suggest that these two molecular species, 60 and 52 kDa Ro, form a conformational epitope. This relationship may explain why anti-52 kDa Ro is found in association with anti-60 kDa Ro.', 22563850: StringElement('There are conflicting data regarding the therapeutic efficacy of platelets inactivated using amotosalen and ultraviolet A light.

Thirteen seroconversion panels, each consisting of a minimum of four samples, were used.

We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of GH replacement in adults with GHD and measured cognition and sense of well-being using standardized psychometric tests before and after therapy. Forty men (median age 51 yr, range 24-64 yr) with a history of pituitary disease were randomized to GH therapy (starting dose, 10 +/- 0.3 micrograms/kg per day: mean treatment dose, 4 +/- 2 micrograms/kg per day) vs. placebo for 18 months, and GH doses were adjusted according to serum insulin growth factor-I levels. At baseline, the patients displayed a full-scale intelligence quotient (IQ) score nearly 1 SD above the normal mean. Mean scores on all cognitive tests fell within normal limits, and on many tests, fell above the mean. On tests of verbal learning and delayed visual memory, mean test scores fell below the mean (although within normal limits), suggestive of a relative compromise in the area of memory performance. Following 18 months of GH replacement therapy, there were no significant changes in cognitive function or quality of life.

Functional mannose-binding lectin (MBL) levels were determined in serum samples, and previously described MBL2, ficolin 2, and MBL-associated serine protease 2 polymorphisms were genotyped. Low MBL serum levels and deficient MBL2 diplotypes were associated with a higher incidence of acute cellular rejection during the first year, in particular in recipients of deceased-donor kidneys. This association remained significant (hazard ratio 1.75, 95% confidence interval 1.18-2.60) in a Cox regression model after adjustment for relevant covariates. In contrast, there was no significant association with rates of antibody-mediated rejection, patient death, early graft dysfunction or loss. Thus, results in a prospective multicenter contemporary cohort suggest that MBL2 polymorphisms result in low MBL serum levels and are associated with acute cellular rejection after kidney transplantation. Since MBL deficiency is a relatively frequent trait in the normal population, our findings may lead to individual risk stratification and customized immunosuppression.', 7963672: 'An important phenomenon in tumor immunology that has come under recent attention is the impact of oncogene activation in tumor cells on the sensitivity to lysis by immune effector cells. Several studies suggested that transfer of an activated ras oncogene into cultured rodent fibroblasts induces susceptibility to natural killer cell (NK)-mediated lysis. Experiments using human tumor cells, however, have produced conflicting data on the effect of ras activation in this respect. In studying the activation of the oncogene c-myc, which is often overexpressed in human melanoma, we have found that in cell lines expressing high levels of Myc protein, the sensitivity to lysis by NK cells was dramatically increased due to reduced expression of Human Leukocyte Antigen B locus products. Since the N-ras oncogene was found to be activated in 15% of human melanomas, we examined the possibility that in melanoma, in analogy to the murine systems, the mutated ras oncogene may influence NK susceptibility of human melanoma cells. Two N-ras genes harboring frequently found mutations were cloned into an expression vector. Transfection of the IGR39D melanoma cell line with wildtype and mutant N-ras constructs yielded several ras-expressing clones that were tested for NK sensitivity. Neither high expression of the wildtype N-ras protein, nor expression of two mutant proteins (N61-arg, N61-lys) was shown to result in enhanced NK-mediated lysis. We conclude that activation of ras oncogenes does not lead to the induction of an NK-sensitive phenotype in human melanoma cells.', 23925786: StringElement('Candidiasis in HIV/AIDS patients continues to be a public health problem.

Such studies may reveal previously unrecognized heterogeneity in antibodies which apparently detect the same antigen on the human red cell surface. Information is also provided on specificities shared amongst several species. Here three anti-LWab and a variety of Rh-related antibodies have been tested against the red cells of various primates. One monoclonal anti-LWab antibody, BS46, reacted with the red cells of gorillas and rhesus monkeys but not those of orang-utans, baboons or marmosets. In contrast, BS56 and NIM-M8 reacted with the cells of all these species. Chimpanzee cells, however, reacted only with NIM-M8. Use of primate cells has shown that all three monoclonal anti-LWab antibodies recognize different epitopes. These observations may explain early conflicting data concerning primate cells. The difference between the monoclonal anti-D, D4, and three other anti-D antibodies, 8G2, 8D6 and 7D10, has been confirmed. The D antigen is apparently confined to the red cells of apes and humans. D4 recognizes a polymorphism in chimpanzees and 8G2, 8D6 and 7D10 recognize a polymorphism in gorillas. Two Rh-related mAbs, R6A and K70, were also investigated. R6A fails to react with Rhnull cells and reacts more weakly with homozygous-D-cells than with cells of common Rh phenotypes. K70 reacts weakly with Rhnull and -D-/-D- cells. The antigen detected by R6A is confined to the red cells of humans, gorillas and chimpanzees, while the antigen detected by K70 shows a wider species distribution. In some primates LW antigens are expressed in the absence of the determinant recognized by R6A. This phenotype has never been known to occur in humans.', 23353901: u'There are seemingly conflicting data in the literature regarding the role of serotonin (5-HT) 5-HT2C receptors in the mouse head-twitch response (HTR) elicited by the hallucinogenic 5-HT2A/2B/2C receptor agonist 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI). Namely, both 5-HT2C receptor agonists and antagonists, regarding 5-HT2C receptor-mediated Gq-phospholipase C (PLC) signaling, reportedly attenuate the HTR response. The present experiments tested the hypothesis that both classes of 5-HT2C receptor compounds could attenuate the DOI-elicited-HTR in a single strain of mice, C57Bl/6J. The expected results were considered in accordance with ligand functional selectivity. Commercially-available 5-HT2C agonists (CP 809101, Ro 60-0175, WAY 161503, mCPP, and 1-methylpsilocin), novel\\xa04-phenyl-2-N,N-dimethyl-aminotetralin (PAT)-type 5-HT2C agonists (with 5-HT2A/2B antagonist activity), and antagonists selective for 5-HT2A (M100907), 5-HT2C (SB-242084), and 5-HT2B/2C (SB-206553) receptors attenuated the DOI-elicited-HTR. In contrast, there were differential effects on locomotion across classes of compounds. The 5-HT2C agonists and M100907 decreased locomotion, SB-242084 increased locomotion, SB-206553 resulted in dose-dependent biphasic effects on locomotion, and the PATs did not alter locomotion. In\\xa0vitro molecular pharmacology studies showed that 5-HT2C agonists potent for attenuating the DOI-elicited-HTR also reduced the efficacy of DOI to activate mouse 5-HT2C receptor-mediated PLC signaling in HEK cells. Although there were differences in affinities of a few compounds at mouse compared to human 5-HT2A or 5-HT2C receptors, all compounds tested retained their selectivity for either receptor, regardless of receptor species. Results indicate that 5-HT2C receptor agonists and antagonists attenuate the DOI-elicited-HTR in C57Bl/6J mice, and suggest that structurally diverse 5-HT2C ligands result in different 5-HT2C receptor signaling outcomes compared to DOI.', 26319903: 'Antiproliferative effects of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the biologically active form of vitamin D, are well established in various cell types by influencing cell differentiation and decreasing cell proliferation, growth, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Several meta-analyses showed that low serum levels of 25(OH)D was associated with colorectal cancer and overall mortality, while the association with cancer mortality was less consistent. VDR is a crucial mediator for the cellular effects of vitamin D and conflicting data have been reported for most malignancies. Beyond VDR, the biological effects of vitamin D are mediated by the vitamin D-binding protein. The GC (group-specific component) gene, encoding DBP, is highly polymorphic and several polymorphisms were investigated in association with cancer development with controversial results. Vitamin D supplementation was found to be associated with a reduced risk of overall mortality, reviewing all published trials on healthy subjects, whereas the evidence of an effect on cancer risk and mortality is less clear. Furthermore, long-term health effects of high doses of vitamin D, extended duration of supplementation, and the association with different baseline vitamin D levels remain to be investigated. In summary, epidemiological and preclinical studies support the development of vitamin D as preventative and therapeutic anticancer agents, with significant associations especially found for low vitamin D status with overall mortality and cancer outcome, more than cancer incidence. However, a definitive conclusion cannot be drawn and only large randomized clinical trials, both in healthy subjects and in cancer patients, will allow to draw definitive conclusions on the effect of vitamin D supplementation on cancer risk, prognosis, and mortality.', 19373088: StringElement('Initial treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax poses dilemmas for clinicians as size classification systems and current treatment guidelines differ in their approaches, and underlying evidence is weak.

The associations between the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism and irinotecan-induced diarrhoea remains controversial because of conflicting data in the literature. Meta-analyses were performed on published data in terms of relationships between UGT1A1*28 and severe diarrhoea. We searched databases for relevant studies that were published in English or Chinese. Two reviewers extracted data and assessed methodological quality. UGT1A1*28 related odds ratios (ORs) were pooled by use of a fixed-effects model. The studies included were stratified into subgroups representing different races and irinotecan doses, and meta-regression analyses were performed to investigate the effect of study characteristics on the association between UGT1A1*28 and diarrhoea. Twenty trials including a total of 1760 cancer patients were included. The risk of severe diarrhoea at medium and high irinotecan doses was higher among patients with a UGT1A1*28/*28 genotype than among those with a UGT1A1*1/*1 genotype (OR=3.69, 95% confidence interval [CI]=2.00-6.83; P<0.001). Considering the patients with a UGT1A1*1/*28 genotype, the risk of toxicity was also higher than among those with a wild-type genotype at medium and high doses (OR=1.92, 95% CI=1.31-2.82; P=0.001). No association was observed between UGT1A1*28 and severe diarrhoea at low doses (<125 mg/m(2)). In conclusion, patients carrying UGT1A1*28 allele(s) are at an increased risk of irinotecan-induced severe diarrhoea. This increased risk is only apparent in those who are administrated with medium or high irinotecan doses.', 2468901: 'Atherosclerosis is an arterial disease characterized by focal accumulation of collagen, elastin, lipids, and calcium at sites associated with macrophage infiltration and altered smooth muscle metabolic function. Studies in several types of animal models, especially cholesterol-fed rabbits, have shown that calcium competitors, calcium chelators, anticalcifying agents, and calcium channel blockers can reduce the accumulation of atherogenic lesion components and thus apparently decrease the progression of lesions. Although there are some conflicting data in the animal model studies using calcium channel antagonists, as a result of differences in experimental designs, it is now apparent that several classes of calcium channel blockers inhibit the progression of early arterial lesions induced by cholesterol feeding. The dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers appear to be more potent antiatherosclerotic agents than other classes of calcium channel antagonists. Several mechanisms involving regulation of endothelial cell, smooth muscle cell, and macrophage metabolic functions may be responsible for the calcium channel blocker effects on early lesion progression. For example, recent studies in cell culture model systems suggest that calcium channel blockers may significantly alter activities that regulate lipoprotein-derived cholesterol accumulation by cells. Some of these activities are independent of calcium flux across voltage-operated calcium channels. Thus, calcium channel blockers may reduce the progression of atherogenic lesions by a combination of decreasing calcium accumulation within arterial wall cells and by altering calcium-independent metabolic activities.', 12573734: StringElement(\"Diabetes is a common chronic illness, affecting approximately 16 million Americans, and is slightly more common in women than men.

We have systematically reviewed the available literature, analyzing and presenting the available in vitro animal and clinical studies on this field. Our comprehensive review reveals the great diversity of the presented data in all groups of studies. Animal and in vitro studies present so conflicting data that even studies with identical parameters have opposing results. Basic science research defining the exact mechanism with which NSAIDs could interfere with bone cells and also the conduction of well-randomized prospective clinical trials are warranted. In the absence of robust clinical or scientific evidence, clinicians should treat NSAIDs as a risk factor for bone healing impairment, and their administration should be avoided in high-risk patients.', 19147816: 'There are conflicting data regarding the effects of transplantation of bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) on the severity of diabetes. We therefore inquired whether the competence of BMDCs is preserved on adoptive transfer into diabetic (db/db) mice and how the adoptive transfer of BMDCs affects vascular and metabolic abnormalities in these mice. Recipient db/db mice received infusions of BMDCs prepared from either db/db or non-diabetic heterozygout mice (db/m) mice and effects on endothelium-dependent relaxation, insulin sensitivity, and renal function were evaluated. Recipients of BMDCs from db/m, but not db/db donors showed better glucose control, exhibited striking improvement in endothelium-dependent relaxation in response to acetylcholine, and had partially restored renal function. Improved glucose control was due to enhanced insulin sensitivity, most likely secondary to improved vascular function. Enhanced apoptosis of endothelial progenitor cells under oxidative stress, as well as decreased endothelial progenitor cell numbers were responsible for the apparent functional incompetence of BMDCs from db/db donors. Treatment of db/db mice with Ebselen restored the resistance of both BMDCs and endothelial progenitor cells to oxidative stress, improved acetylcholine-induced vasorelaxation, and reduced proteinuria in db/db recipients of BMDC transplantation. In conclusion, infusion of BMDCs obtained from db/m donors to db/db recipient mice benefited macrovascular function, insulin sensitivity, and nephropathy. BMDCs obtained from db/db mice were functionally incompetent secondary to the increased proportion of apoptotic cells on oxidative stress challenge; their competence was restored by Ebselen therapy.', 26668075: StringElement('The coronary slow flow phenomenon (CSFP) is defined as a delayed distal vessel contrast opacification in the absence of obstructive epicardial coronary artery disease during coronary angiography.

In this study, the host defence mechanisms evoked by two different immunocompetent murine strains following oral colonization with Candida albicans were assessed. beta-Defensin (mBD1, mBD3 and mBD4), chemokine (MIP-2 and KC) and cytokine (TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12 and IL-15) gene expression in germ-free (gf) and C. albicans-infected (gastric) C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice was contrasted. Gf C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice expressed significantly different basal levels of mBD3, mBD4, TNF-alpha and IL-12 in gastric tissues; however, gf C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice were equally susceptible to intestinal colonization with C. albicans and had similar fungal burdens in gastric tissues 4 weeks after oral challenge. C57BL/6 mice responded to colonization and gastric candidiasis with increased expression of mBD1, mBD3, mBD4, TNF-alpha, MIP-2, KC and IL-12. Conversely, a much more specific and attenuated response was observed in Candida-infected gastric tissues from BALB/c mice. Therefore, different strains of mice that were equally susceptible to gastric candidiasis after oral challenge had divergent cytokine, chemokine and beta-defensin responses. This suggests that conflicting data as to the relevance of cytokines and other host factors in murine resistance to candidiasis may be explained, at least in part, by the strain of mouse studied.', 18437170: \"Personalized/individualized/tailored therapy for each patient is an important goal for improving the outcome of patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma and includes the intention to maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents. Numerous barriers must be overcome to reach this goal because outcome is affected by an unholy trinity of tumor characteristics that include somatic alterations at the DNA, RNA, and protein level; patient characteristics that include germline genetic differences such as polymorphisms in enzymes affecting the metabolism of chemotherapeutic agents; and environmental exposures and factors that include diet and physical activity. At present, evaluation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression by immunohistochemistry in colorectal adenocarcinoma is generally required for treatment with one of the monoclonal antibody therapies directed against that target, despite the absence of evidence for predictive value of the assay, whereas EGFR fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) may be predictive. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration of the United States now requires a 'black box' warning on the packaging of irinotecan for evaluation of germline polymorphism in UGT1A1, the gene mutated in Gilbert's syndrome, for potential reduction of drug dosage in patients with the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism. Numerous other potential markers have been identified but have not yet reached levels of evidence that support their routine usage. For example, KRAS gene mutation appears to preclude improved survival after therapy with monoclonal antibody therapy directed at EGFR, and extensive DNA methylation is associated with lack of efficacy of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy. Additional markers will come into routine usage as reports of research studies continue to appear in the literature. Clinical trials driven by molecular targets and agents directed against them, and understanding of the conflicting data on utility of markers reported in the literature, are needed to advance the field.\", 9669683: 'Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been detected in the large majority of HIV-related primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSL) suggesting a pathogenetic role of the virus. Unlike HIV-related PCNSL, conflicting data exist with regard to the presence of EBV in non immunodeficiency-related (sporadic) PCNSL. For this reason, a population based material of 41 sporadic PCNSL was analysed for the presence of EBV genome (EBER, BHLF) using RNA in situ hybridisation (RISH). Furthermore, the expression of the gene products of the bcl-2 oncogene and the p53 tumor suppressor gene and the tumor growth fraction reactive with the monoclonal antibody Ki-67 have been evaluated. All cases but two were EBV genome negative. In the two positive cases less than 5% of tumor cells showed EBER positivity. In contrast, more than 75% of cells morphologically belonging to the tumor-cell population stained positively for EBER in two cases of HIV related PCNSL. Immunostaining for the bcl-2 oncoprotein was positive in 28 (72%) of 39 cases examined. In most cases more than 75% of tumor cells showed cytoplasmic expression. Of 37 cases investigated for p53 expression, 21 (57%) stained positively. However, in the large majority of positive cases less than 10% of the neoplastic cells stained. The percentage of Ki-67 positive cells ranged between 10% and 80% with a mean of 50%. The expression of the p53 and bcl-2 oncoproteins and the growth fraction did not have any prognostic impact. We conclude that the EBV genome is rarely detected in sporadic PCNSL, indicating that a pathogenetic role of EBV is unlikely.

Alcohol is predominantly metabolised in the liver by the microsomal alcohol oxidising system, alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and a catalase enzyme. Histochemical and kinetic studies have revealed several ADH isoenzymes in the gastric mucosa with different kinetic properties. After small oral doses of alcohol first-pass metabolism in the stomach occurs, as shown by reduced area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) compared with intravenous or intraduodenal administration. The activity of gastric ADH is reduced in women, the elderly, Asian individuals, the fasting state, chronic alcoholism and after gastrectomy. The effect is only present with small (< or = 0.3 g/kg) alcohol doses and with a high alcohol concentration. In a number of studies, cimetidine in therapeutic doses over 7 days produced a significant increase in the AUC and in the peak plasma concentration after administration of alcohol 0.15 and 0.30 g/kg. This was related to an inhibition of gastric ADH activity, as shown by in vitro studies. Ranitidine inhibited gastric ADH to a similar extent on a molar basis, but its effect on alcohol levels in vivo was less constant in various studies. Nizatidine also reduced gastric alcohol first-pass metabolism, but famotidine and roxatidine did not show this effect. In other studies, H2-receptor antagonists did not change AUC and peak alcohol concentration. The controversy is not easy to resolve, since a number of the positive studies did not use a placebo-controlled, randomised, crossover design, while some of the negative studies did not exclude habitual alcohol consumers and included Oriental volunteers, although both groups have been shown to lack significant gastric ADH activity. In this case, when first-pass metabolism of alcohol does not exist, this by definition cannot be abolished by H2-antagonists. The inclusion of oral and intravenous dosage data of alcohol is mandatory to positively identify first-pass metabolism in any individuals. The significance of the effect of H2-antagonists on blood alcohol concentrations is minor. It only occurs in young, male, nonalcoholic, non-Asian individuals, and alcohol must be given in a small (social) dose, in a high concentration, and after meals. An increase in alcohol levels in predisposed patients during treatment with some H2-antagonists cannot be excluded, although the likelihood is small.

However, there is conflicting data on the frequency of fractures, changes of bone mineral density and the levels of bone metabolic markers in diabetes. These results may be related to heterogeneity of the patients in the studies, i.e., the presence or absence of insulin injection, body mass index, the amounts of intrinsic insulin secretion and/or insulin resistance. The combination of poor bone quality and frequent injurious falls would be expected to increase fracture incidence and a recent report revealed that older women with diabetes had a particularly increased risk of fractures. The metabolic effects of poor glycemic control lead to increased bone resorption without sufficient bone formation. With respect to bone metabolic markers, decreased levels of osteocalcin (OC) have been commonly reported. It is not known whether decreased OC is a predictive factor for fractures in diabetes, but the osteocalcin levels have been found to return toward the normal range after glycemic control. Since OC is known to be glycosylated, it is also possible that the measurement would be affected by high glucose conditions. The exact value of bone metabolic markers in diabetes has not been established, but measurement of osteocalcin may be a useful tool for evaluation of risk of fractures in diabetic patients.', 2206784: '1.

To help clarify this role, we investigated the effects of ceramide on IL-2, a central NF-kappaB target. We found that ceramide inhibited protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated activation of NF-kappaB. Ceramide was found to significantly reduce the kinase activity of PKCtheta as well as PKCalpha, the critical PKC isozymes involved in TCR-induced NF-kappaB activation. This was followed by strong inhibition of IL-2 production in both Jurkat T leukemia and primary T cells. Exogenous sphingomyelinase, which generates ceramide at the cell membrane, also inhibited IL-2 production. As expected, the repression of NF-kappaB activation by ceramide led to the reduction of transcription of the IL-2 gene in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of IL-2 production by ceramide was partially overcome when NF-kappaB nuclear translocation was reconstituted with activation of a PKC-independent pathway by TNF-alpha or when PKCtheta was overexpressed. Importantly, neither the conversion of ceramide to complex glycosphingolipids, which are known to have immunosuppressive effects, nor its hydrolysis to sphingosine, a known inhibitor of PKC, was necessary for its inhibitory activity. These results indicate that ceramide plays a negative regulatory role in the activation of NF-kappaB and its targets as a result of inhibition of PKC.', 14724165: StringElement('High magnification chromoscopic colonoscopy (HMCC) permits the in vivo examination of the colorectal pit pattern, which has a high correlation with stereomicroscopic appearances of resected specimens.

Genomic, proteomic and metabolomic analyses of in vitro and in vivo model systems is also warranted to comprehensively understand the network of vitamin D regulated pathways in the context of breast cancer heterogeneity.', 1569832: 'The effect of three doses of indomethacin (Indo) on BCG-induced PMN migration at different times of day was studied in Swiss mice kept on a lighting regimen of LD 12:12, with L from 07:00 to 19:00. Experimental granulomas were induced by subcutaneous implantation of BCG-impregnated cell traps for a time span of 480 min. Doses of 1, 3 and 9 mg/kg of Indo were given orally one hour before trap implantation, at 01:00, 05:00, 09:00, 13:00, 17:00 and 21:00 hr. In sham animals, the maximal PMN count occurred at 17:00 hr. In treated mice, Indo increased or decreased the number of PMN/mm2 as a function of time of administration. Cell migration was inhibited at 17:00 hr by all 3 Indo doses, while the number of PMN in the cell trap increased at 21:00 hr. Various dose-effects were obtained at the other times of day. Several hypotheses are proposed to explain the conflicting data. The results indicate the importance of the time of drug administration in biology.', 2035556: \"The relative contributions of home tokodynamometry and daily nursing telephone contact to the success of preterm birth prevention programs remains a subject of debate. Because investigators have obtained conflicting data, a reinterpretation of published results was undertaken by proposing a dynamic interface between the nurse and the machine. Experience gained from the technology and the development of nursing expertise with assessment of patient symptoms are presented as interdependent factors, both of which are critical to a therapeutic nurse-patient relationship. It is proposed that this combined interactive expertise increases sensitivity to the early recognition of preterm labor. The nurse's role in providing social support to high-risk pregnant women is then identified as a potential additional independent contributing factor to reported observed reductions in preterm births. Discussion focuses on future research, public policy issues, and the need for expanding nurse-patient interactions into the home.\", 8819803: \"While surgery for Crohn's disease is usually effective initially, its long-term benefits may be diminished by the risk of recurrent disease. In our studies, we have observed symptomatic recurrence rates of 47% and endoscopic recurrence rates of 75% at 3 years. As a result, there has been considerable interest in strategies aimed at decreasing recurrence. Unfortunately, surgical manoeuvers have had little effect on recurrence rates. There are conflicting data on the effect of resection margin length and microscopic disease at the resection margin, probably due to the fact that most data are derived from retrospective studies. Differences in anastomotic technique also appear to have little effect on the recurrence rate. On the other hand, there are now data from two randomized controlled trials supporting the use of 5-aminosalicylic acid postoperatively. In a study performed at the University of Toronto and Mayo Clinic, of 163 patients who were randomized to 5-aminosalicylic acid (Salofalk) 3.0 g/day or placebo, the relative risk of a symptomatic recurrence was 0.628 in the treatment group compared to those in the control group. For compliant patients, the risk reduction was even greater with a RR of 0.532. A similar reduction in the endoscopic recurrence rate was observed. Caprilli and colleagues reported similar results in patients receiving 2.4 g Asacol per day. Postoperative recurrence is a significant problem but is significantly reduced by the prophylactic use of 5-aminosalicylic acid.\", 23148113: 'Conflicting data have been reported in dentistry regarding the diagnostic potential of monitoring body sway while in a static standing bipedalic position. This systematic review reappraises previously reported effects of mandibular position, asymmetric occlusion, and temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) on body sway to determine whether there is sufficient evidence for such correlations and to define the potential diagnostic applications in orthodontics. A literature survey was performed using the Medline, LILACS, and SciELO databases, and the Cochrane Library, covering the period from January 1980 to December 2011. Twelve articles qualified for the final analysis. All of these studies investigated the effects of mandibular position, two focussed also on asymmetrical occlusion, and three on TMDs. Only two studies were judged to be of medium or medium/high quality, with all of the rest classified as low-quality design; no study included follow-up. According to the conclusions of these reports, four studies saw significant correlations between body sway and mandibular position or TMDs. After a reappraisal of the full data set, generally no clinically relevant correlations were uncovered in the comparisons. While more investigations with improved levels of scientific evidence are needed, according to current evidence, the static monitoring of body sway as a diagnostic aid in orthodontics may not be indicated.', 8760413: 'Recently, conflicting data have been published about the ability of antibodies which efficiently neutralize T cell-adapted human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains to neutralize primary HIV-1 strains in vitro and in vivo. Here we present data indicating that such antibodies fail to neutralize primary HIV-1 strains in vivo. To this end, a newly developed chimeric human-to-mouse model was used, in which several aspects of primary HIV-1 infection are mimicked. Poly- and monoclonal antibodies protected the grafted human cells, in a dose-dependent way, from infection with T cell-adapted HIV-1 in this system. A human monoclonal antibody specific for the CD4 binding domain that efficiently neutralizes HIV-1 IIIB in vitro did not protect the human graft from HIV-1 IIIB infection. None of the antibodies provided protection in the in vivo model against infection with primary HIV-1 strains, although they were able to neutralize these same strains in vitro.', 15518817: 'Group B coxsackieviruses (CVB) are believed to trigger some cases of human type 1 diabetes (T1D), although the mechanism by which this may occur has not been shown. We demonstrated previously that inoculation of young nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice with any of several different CVB strains reduced T1D incidence. We also observed no evidence of CVB replication within islets of young NOD mice, suggesting no role for CVB in T1D induction in the NOD mouse model. The failure to observe CVB replication within islets of young NOD mice has been proposed to be due to interferon expression by insulin-producing beta cells or lack of expression of the CVB receptor CAR. We found that CAR protein is detectable within islets of young and older NOD mice and that a CVB3 strain, which expresses murine IL-4, can replicate in islets. Mice inoculated with the IL-4 expressing CVB3 chimeric strain were better protected from T1D onset than were mock-infected control mice despite intraislet viral replication. Having demonstrated that CVB can replicate in healthy islets of young NOD mice when the intraislet environment is suitably altered, we asked whether islets in old prediabetic mice were resistant to CVB infection. Unlike young mice in which insulitis is not yet apparent, older NOD mice demonstrate severe insulitis in all islets. Inoculating older prediabetic mice with different pathogenic CVB strains caused accelerated T1D onset relative to control mice, a phenomenon that was preceded by detection of virus within islets. Together, the results suggest a model for resolving conflicting data regarding the role of CVB in human T1D etiology.', 21908578: \"A critical link exists between an individual's ability to repair cellular DNA damage and cancer development, progression, and response to therapy. Knowledge gained about the proteins involved and types of damage repaired by the individual DNA repair pathways has led to the development of a variety of assays aimed at determining an individual's DNA repair capacity. These assays and their use in the analysis of clinical samples have yielded useful though somewhat conflicting data. In this review article, we discuss the major DNA repair pathways, the proteins and genes required for each, assays used to analyze activity, and the relevant clinical studies to date. With the recent results from clinical trials targeting specific DNA repair proteins for the treatment of cancer, accurate, reproducible, and relevant analysis of DNA repair takes on an even greater significance. We highlight the strengths and limitations of these DNA repair studies and assays, with respect to the clinical assessment of DNA repair capacity to determine cancer development and response to therapy.\", 10607716: 'Activation-induced cell death (AICD) in T cells is mediated by CD95 ligand (CD95L)/receptor interaction, which has also been implicated in apoptosis induction by some anticancer agents. In this article we show that both anti-CD3-triggering (AICD) and doxorubicin treatment led to the production of a functionally active CD95L in the CD3+/T-cell receptor-positive (TCR+) T leukemia cell line H9. CD95L-expressing H9 cells killed CD95-sensitive J16 or CEM target cells, but not CD95-resistant CEM or J16 cells overexpressing dominant negative FADD (J16/FADD-DN). By immunoprecipitation, CD95L was physically bound to CD95, suggesting that AICD and doxorubicin-induced apoptosis involve CD95L-mediated CD95 aggregation, thereby triggering the CD95 death pathway. CD95 aggregation was associated with the recruitment of FADD and caspase-8 to the CD95 receptor to form the CD95 death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), resulting in caspase-8 activation and cleavage of the effector caspase-3 and PARP. Blocking of the CD95L/receptor interaction by antagonistic antibodies to CD95 or to CD95L also blocked AICD and inhibited the early phase of doxorubicin-induced apoptosis, though cell death induced by doxorubicin eventually proceeded in a CD95-independent manner. These findings may explain some conflicting data on the role of death receptor systems in drug-induced apoptosis. Thus, in cells with an inducible CD95 receptor/ligand system, drug-induced apoptosis may be mediated by CD95L-initiated DISC formation and activation of downstream effector programs similar to AICD in T cells.

After binding to their target antigens at the basement membrane of the dermal-epidermal junction these autoantibodies are thought to trigger an inflammatory cascade comprising complement- and granulocyte-dependent reactions that result in tissue damage. Whereas the role of anti-BP180 antibodies has been extensively characterized, few and conflicting data is available on the contribution of anti-BP230 antibodies to bullous pemphigoid pathogenesis. Therefore, we addressed in the present study the role of autoantibodies to BP230 in experimental bullous pemphigoid. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies generated against epitopes of the C-terminal fragment of murine BP230 bound to the basement membrane and activated the complement system ex vivo. Affinity-purified antibodies were subsequently subcutaneously transferred into neonatal and adult BALB/c mice. In vivo, we observed a dose-dependent binding of transferred antibodies in the murine skin; however, there was no complement activation and these mice showed no clinical or histological signs of inflammatory disease, in contrast to mice receiving anti-BP180 antibodies. We further conducted ex vivo experiments and demonstrated that rabbit IgG anti-BP230-specific antibodies, in contrast to antibodies from bullous pemphigoid patients or rabbit IgG anti-BP180 antibodies used as positive controls, did not activate human granulocytes to induce dermal-epidermal separation in skin cryosections. Our present findings demonstrate that antibodies against BP230 are non-pathogenic in experimental models of bullous pemphigoid and suggest that proper activation of the complement and granulocytes represent prerequisites for conferring bullous pemphigoid autoantibodies their tissue destructive potential.', 12211047: StringElement('Oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer is increasing all over the world, frequently affecting more and more women and younger individuals and not only the typical 50- to 60-year-old heavy smoker and drinking man.

However, the combination of AsA, a free radical scavenger, with radiation is not clearly understood; conflicting data are reported for cancer cell death. We conducted this study to determine the effect of AsA treatment combined with X-irradiation and the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells. Additive cytotoxic effects were observed when the cells were exposed to 2 Gy X-irradiation after 2.5 mM AsA treatment. When catalase was added to the culture with AsA alone, the cytotoxic effects of AsA disappeared. X-irradiation increased intercellular ROS levels and mitochondrial superoxide levels. By contrast, AsA alone and in combination with X-irradiation decreased ROS levels. However, in the presence of catalase neutralizing H2O2, AsA alone or in combination with X-irradiation only slightly decreased the intercellular ROS. Moreover, AsA decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential, which is commonly associated with apoptosis. These results suggest that the reduction of ROS did not result from ROS scavenging by AsA, and AsA induced apoptosis through a ROS-independent pathway. This study reports that a combination of AsA with radiation treatment is effective in cancer therapy when considering ROS in cancer cells.', 16599912: 'Two cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, are expressed in mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish. The presence of cannabinoid receptors in invertebrates has been controversial, due to conflicting evidence. We conducted a systematic review of the literature, using expanded search parameters. Evidence presented in the literature varied in validity, ranging from crude in vivo behavioural assays to robust in silico ortholog discovery. No research existed for several clades of invertebrates; we therefore tested for cannabinoid receptors in seven representative species, using tritiated ligand binding assays with [3H]CP55,940 displaced by the CB1-selective antagonist SR141716A. Specific binding of [3H]CP55,940 was found in neural membranes of Ciona intestinalis (Deuterstoma, a positive control), Lumbricusterrestris (Lophotrochozoa), and three ecdysozoans: Peripatoides novae-zealandiae (Onychophora), Jasus edwardi (Crustacea) and Panagrellus redivivus (Nematoda); the potency of displacement by SR141716A was comparable to measurements on rat cerebellum. No specific binding was observed in Actinothoe albocincta (Cnidaria) or Tethya aurantium (Porifera). The phylogenetic distribution of cannabinoid receptors may address taxonomic questions; previous studies suggested that the loss of CB1 was a synapomorphy shared by ecdysozoans. Our discovery of cannabinoid receptors in some nematodes, onychophorans, and crustaceans does not contradict the Ecdysozoa hypothesis, but gives it no support. We hypothesize that cannabinoid receptors evolved in the last common ancestor of bilaterians, with secondary loss occurring in insects and other clades. Conflicting data regarding Cnidarians precludes hypotheses regarding the last common ancestor of eumetazoans. No cannabinoid receptors are expressed in sponges, which probably diverged before the origin of the eumetazoan ancestor.', 27882611: u'Since there is conflicting data on the buffering and ergogenic properties of calcium lactate (CL), we investigated the effect of chronic CL supplementation on blood pH, bicarbonate, and high-intensity intermittent exercise performance. Sodium bicarbonate (SB) was used as a positive control. Eighteen athletes participated in this double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, fully counterbalanced study. All participants underwent three different treatments: placebo (PL), CL, and SB. The dose was identical in all conditions: 500\\xa0mg/kg BM divided into four daily individual doses of 125\\xa0mg/kg BM, for five consecutive days, followed by a 2-7-day washout period. On the fifth day of supplementation, individuals undertook four 30-s Wingate bouts for upper body with 3-min recovery between bouts. Total mechanical work (TMW) for the overall protocol and for the initial (1st+2nd) and final (3rd+4th) bouts was determined at each session. Blood pH, bicarbonate, and lactate levels were determined at rest, immediately and 5\\xa0min after exercise. CL supplementation did not affect performance (P\\xa0>\\xa00.05 for the overall TMW as well for initial and final bouts), nor did it affect blood bicarbonate and pH prior to exercise. SB supplementation improved performance by 2.9% for overall TMW (P\\xa0=\\xa00.02) and 5.9% in the 3rd+4th bouts (P\\xa0=\\xa00001).

Polydipsic patients without hyponatremia (polydipsic normonatremic schizophrenics: PNS) exhibit similar, albeit less marked, changes in neuroendocrine activity and anterior hippocampal function, but not reduced anterior hippocampal volume. Indeed, reduced anterior hippocampal volume is seen in patients with normal water balance (nonpolydipsic normonatremic schizophrenics: NNS) whose neuroendocrine activity and anterior hippocampal function differ markedly from those with polydipsia. In an effort to reconcile these findings we measured hippocampal, amygdala and 3rd ventricle shapes in 26 schizophrenic patients (10 PNS, 7 PHS, 9 NNS) and 12 healthy controls matched for age and gender. Bilateral inward deformations were localized to the anterior lateral hippocampal surface (part of a neurocircuit which modulates neuroendocrine responses to psychological stimuli) in PHS and to a lesser extent in PNS, while deformations in NNS were restricted to the medial surface. Proportional deformations of the right medial amygdala, a key segment of this neurocircuit, were seen in both polydipsic groups, and correlated with the volume of the 3rd ventricle, which lies adjacent to the neuroendocrine nuclei. Finally, these structural findings were most marked in those with impaired hippocampal-mediated stress responses. These results reconcile previously conflicting data, and support the view that anterior lateral hippocampal pathology disrupts neuroendocrine function in polydipsic patients with and without hyponatremia.

These infections are characterised by high mortality, especially in patients with persistent granulocytopenia and in those receiving allogeneic bone marrow transplants. The most important pathogens in neutropenic patients are Candida and Aspergillus spp. Usually, Candida infections arise from overgrowth in the gastrointestinal tract, while Aspergillus infections are acquired by inhalation of spores. Prophylaxis of systemic fungal infections seems mandatory since optimal strategies for diagnosis and treatment of these infections are lacking. Treatment with the non-absorbable polyenes nystatin and amphotericin B is useful for prophylaxis of superficial fungal infections, provided that compliance of the patients is optimal. The imidazoles ketoconazole and miconazole can reduce the incidence of superficial fungal infections, but there are conflicting data regarding their value for prevention of systemic mycoses. There are several studies indicating that prophylactic use of fluconazole reduces the incidence of mucosal and systemic fungal infections, especially in patients receiving allogeneic bone marrow transplants. Fluconazole shows reduced activity against several Non-albicans spp. and is not active against Aspergillus spp. Itraconazole has in vitro and in vivo activity against several Aspergillus spp. but high serum and tissue levels are necessary. However, bioavailability of itraconazole is reduced in patients with raised gastric pH and no i.v. formulation is available. Although there is some evidence for its prophylactic activity against Aspergillus infections in neutropenic patients, more studies are necessary to confirm these findings.

Although there are known genetic and phenotypic differences between ST313 strains and gastroenteritis-associated ST19 strains, conflicting data about the in vivo virulence of ST313 strains have been reported. To resolve these differences, we tested clinical Salmonella Typhimurium ST313 and ST19 strains in murine and rhesus macaque infection models. The 50% lethal dose (LD50) was determined for three Salmonella Typhimurium ST19 and ST313 strains in mice. For dissemination studies, bacterial burden in organs was determined at various time-points post-challenge. Indian rhesus macaques were infected with one ST19 and one ST313 strain. Animals were monitored for clinical signs and bacterial burden and pathology were determined. The LD50 values for ST19 and ST313 infected mice were not significantly different. However, ST313-infected BALB/c mice had significantly higher bacterial numbers in blood at 24 h than ST19-infected mice. ST19-infected rhesus macaques exhibited moderate-to-severe diarrhea while ST313-infected monkeys showed no-to-mild diarrhea. ST19-infected monkeys had higher bacterial burden and increased inflammation in tissues. Our data suggest that Salmonella Typhimurium ST313 invasiveness may be investigated using mice. The non-human primate results are consistent with clinical data, suggesting that ST313 strains do not cause diarrhea.', 26305672: 'Large cholinergic synaptic terminals known as C-boutons densely innervate the soma and proximal dendrites of motoneurons that are prone to neurodegeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Studies using the Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) mouse model of ALS have generated conflicting data regarding C-bouton alterations exhibited during ALS pathogenesis. In the present work, a longitudinal study combining immunohistochemistry, biochemical approaches and extra- and intra-cellular electrophysiological recordings revealed that the whole spinal cholinergic system is modified in the SOD1 mouse model of ALS compared to wild type (WT) mice as early as the second postnatal week. In WT motoneurons, both C-bouton terminals and associated M2 postsynaptic receptors presented a complex age-related dynamic that appeared completely disrupted in SOD1 motoneurons. Indeed, parallel to C-bouton morphological alterations, analysis of confocal images revealed a clustering process of M2 receptors during WT motoneuron development and maturation that was absent in SOD1 motoneurons. Our data demonstrated for the first time that the lamina X cholinergic interneurons, the neuronal source of C-boutons, are over-abundant in high lumbar segments in SOD1 mice and are subject to neurodegeneration in the SOD1 animal model. Finally, we showed that early C-bouton system alterations have no physiological impact on the cholinergic neuromodulation of newborn motoneurons. Altogether, these data suggest a complete reconfiguration of the spinal cholinergic system in SOD1 spinal networks that could be part of the compensatory mechanisms established during spinal development.', 9884866: 'Intuitively it seems obvious that unrelieved, severe acute pain after surgery may have a number of undesirable effects [1].

These discrepancies are probably due to multiple factors. First, the effects of cardiac hypertrophy on channel expression and cell adaptation are model dependent. Even within the same species, the mechanisms by which cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure are generated (genetic alteration, pressure overload, volume overload, high rate pacing, etc.) influence the results obtained. Second, with many animal models and diseased human hearts, the disease process is not uniformly distributed throughout the myocardium. Third, the effects on L-type Ca2+ channel behavior and SR function clearly depend on the extent of disease expression. Myocardial contractility increases with cardiac hypertrophy whereas it decreases with heart failure. Thus, it is difficult to compare results from different models of hypertrophy and heart failure at different stages of disease. More consistent data is likely to be obtained from longitudinal studies using a single animal model of disease. The challenge before us is to develop animal models that mimic human disease, which can be studied longitudinally during the progression of the disease process. This approach coupled with continued improvement in Ca2+ imaging and a greater understanding of normal E-C coupling, will enable us to identify precisely the abnormalities in E-C coupling that occur with the development of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure and define the appropriate treatment modalities.', 17892505: '1. Activation of p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) has been implicated in the signalling cascade leading to protection by ischaemic preconditioning. This, however, is controversial and there is a plethora of conflicting data in the literature. Although many experimental differences may contribute to this, two in particular may be confounding: (i) the failure to account for p38-MAPK activation during aerobic perfusion; and (ii) the use of the anti-oxidant dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) as the vehicle for the commonly used p38-MAPK inhibitor SB203580. We have investigated the effects of aerobic perfusion, ischaemia and preconditioning on p38-MAPK activation. In addition, we have used water-soluble SB203580 hydrochloride (SB203580.HCl) and DMSO to probe the role of p38-MAPK in preconditioning and ischaemic injury. 2. Activation of p38-MAPK in rat isolated hearts was assessed using a dual phosphospecific antibody during cannulation, aerobic perfusion and index, autolytic and preconditioned ischaemia. The effect of SB203580.HCl (10 mmol/L) in ischaemic preconditioning and ischaemia/reperfusion was tested using recovery of function and tetrazolium (TTC) staining as end-points. 3. Aerobic perfusion induced rapid activation (34% of maximal ischaemia-induced increase; P < 0.05) of p38-MAPK after 2 min that returned to baseline after 30 min. Index, autolytic and preconditioned ischaemia activated p38-MAPK, with index ischaemia peaking after 15 min (520% of basal; P < 0.05) before declining. SB203580.HCl blocked p38-MAPK activity, but did not block ischaemic preconditioning when bracketing the trigger phase and was not protective when given during ischaemia. 4. In the rat isolated heart, activation of p38-MAPK is neither a unique feature of preconditioning nor a prerequisite.

Map2k4 is essential during embryogenesis and involved in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. However, studies on its role in cancer development revealed partially conflicting data. In the present study, we report the identification of a novel splice variant of Map2k4, Map2k4\\u03b4, with an additional exon in front of the substrate binding D-domain. Map2k4\\u03b4 is expressed together with Map2k4 in various tissues from rat, mouse and human. In PC12 cells, both splice variants control cell cycle progression and basal apoptosis by using different signaling pathways. If expression and activation of Map2k4 and Map2k4\\u03b4 are at a certain, cell type-specific equilibrium, an appropriate cell growth is ensured. Overexpression of one kinase disrupts the intricate balance and either results in a highly proliferative or pro-apoptotic phenotype, partially reflecting the discrepancies in the literature on Map2k4 and its role in tumor development.

Anti-LKM1 in AIH are directed against cytochrome P4502D6 (CYP2D6), but conflicting data exist concerning the specificity of anti-LKM in hepatitis C. The aim of this study was to evaluate binding specificities of anti-LKM antibodies in both diseases using novel test antigens as well as their inhibitory capacity on CYP2D6 enzyme activity. Sera from 22 patients with AIH type II and 17 patients with hepatitis C being anti-LKM-positive in the immunofluorescence test were investigated for binding to native recombinant CYP2D6 and liver microsomes by ELISA and immunoblotting, and to synthetic peptides covering the region 254-339 (254-273, 257-269, 270-294, 291-310, 307-324, 321-339, 373-389) as well as the novel peptide 196-218 by ELISA. Furthermore, all sera were tested for inhibition of CYP2D6-dependent bufuralol 1'-hydroxylase activity. Twenty of the 22 AIH type II sera (91%) and nine of the 17 hepatitis C sera (53%) were positive for CYP2D6 by ELISA and/or immunoblotting. The previously described major peptide epitope comprising CYP2D6 amino acids 257-269 was recognized by 16 of the 22 AIH sera but by only one hepatitis C serum. A further epitope, 196-218, could be defined for the first time as another immunodominant epitope for AIH because it was recognized by 15 of the 22 AIH (68%) but only three of the 17 hepatitis C sera (18%). With the exception of the peptide 254-273, the other peptides showed no significant reactivity. Analysing the inhibitory properties of anti-LKM antibodies it emerged that 95% of AIH sera and 88% of hepatitis C sera inhibited enzyme function. These data indicate that anti-LKM antibodies in AIH and hepatitis C react with CYP2D6, as shown by their inhibitory activity, and that besides the known epitope 257-269 a further immunodominant epitope exists on CYP2D6 which is recognized by sera from patients with AIH II but hardly by sera from patients with hepatitis C.\", 22002853: StringElement('Congestive heart failure (CHF) and diabetes mellitus (DM) are increasing in prevalence.

SCID mice engrafted with human fetal thymus and liver tissue fragments (SCID-hu mice), which sustain normal human T cell differentiation in the thymus graft, were used to directly assess the sensitivity of the human thymus for TCDD. Wistar rats and SCID-hu mice were exposed to 1, 5 or 25 micrograms TCDD/kg body weight. Histopathologic effects were evaluated for rat thymus and transplanted human thymus on Day 4 after exposure. The relative size of the cortex showed a dose-dependent decrease in both the normal rat thymus and grafted human thymus (significant at 25 micrograms/kg). SCID-ra mice (SCID mice with a fetal rat thymus and liver graft) were used as an intermediate model between the normal rat and SCID-hu mice, and were exposed to the same dose levels of TCDD. However, 90% of the SCID-ra mice developed a cutaneous graft-versus-host reaction, associated with lymphodepletion of the rat thymus grafts, and hence a limited number of SCID-ra mice were available for evaluation of TCDD effects. The data obtained in SCID-ra mice were in line with those in normal rat and grafted human thymus. In gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis, TCDD tissue concentrations in the normal rat thymus and grafted human thymus were similar.

Plasma levels of prostacyclin (PGI2, measured as the stable metabolite 6-keto-PGF1 alpha) and thromboxane A2 (TxA2, measured as TxB2) in the effluent blood of a canine ileal segment were determined following 1 or 2 h of ischemia. The synthesis of both eicosanoids was significantly stimulated during reperfusion, but extension of the ischemic interval from 60 to 120 min was not followed by a further increase. The role of oxidants potentially involved in the process was investigated by using materials that inactivate the xanthine-oxidase-generated intermediates. Previous studies on the same in vivo animal model had demonstrated the effectiveness of antioxidant therapy in reducing the postischemic histamine release. There was no significant alteration in the amount of eicosanoids synthesized following oral allopurinol, catalase, dimethylsulfoxide, mannitol or desferrioxamine treatment. Intravenously administered allopurinol, however, significantly elevated the postischemic 6-keto-PGF1 alpha/TxB2 ratio. The results suggest that these antioxidants at doses inhibitory to histamine liberation are not effective in influencing the postischemic eicosanoid release. Intravenously administered allopurinol could exert a potentially beneficial effect through a mechanism other than the blockade of xanthine oxidase.', 15117493: 'HIV accelerates progression of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related liver disease.

Hepatotoxicity was the most prominent toxicity in preclinical studies and was greater in female rats than in male rats. To assess the potential implications for human toxicities, the in vitro metabolism of ET743 was characterized using rat and human preparations. NADPH-dependent ET743 metabolism was greater with male rat liver microsomal preparations than with preparations from female rats and was induced by pretreatment of rats with phenobarbital and dexamethasone but not by pretreatment with 3-methylcholanthrene. Rat and human microsomal metabolism of ET743 was reduced in the presence of chemical CYP3A inhibitors or antirat CYP3A2 antiserum and to a much lesser extent by CYP2E, CYP2C, and CYP2A inhibitors. In human liver panel studies, ET743 disappearance was highly correlated with CYP3A activities and to a lesser extent with CYP2C activities. ET743 was metabolized by a number of cDNA-expressed rat P-450 isoforms, including male-predominant CYP2A2 and CYP3A2. ET743 was metabolized by cDNA-expressed human CYP3A4 and to a much lesser extent by CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1 preparations. Three oxidative metabolites were detected in cDNA-expressed isoform incubations, including the N-demethylated metabolite ET729 and two additional products characterized by laser capture-mass spectrometry analyses. The plasma pharmacokinetics and biliary excretion of ET743 were characterized in rats. There were no gender-dependent differences in half-life or total body clearance values. Although very modest, the biliary excretion of ET743 in male rats (0.48%) was greater than in female rats (0.28%). In contrast, the biliary excretion of the cytotoxic N-demethylated metabolite ET729 was 5-fold greater in the female rat (1.05% of dose) than in the male rat (0.19% of dose). Biliary excretion of ET729 may contribute to the hepatic toxicity in rats. These data are consistent with a major role for CYP3A isoforms in ET743 rat and human metabolism. Although there are conflicting data in the literature, expression of CYP3A isoforms in human tissues and elimination of CYP3A substrates have not been shown to vary substantially by gender. There are no indications that the other CYP isoforms implicated in ET743 metabolism are expressed differently in males and females. Thus, although it is not possible to rule out gender differences in ET743 human toxicities, our data do not predict major gender-dependent differences in the toxicity of ET743 based on metabolism.', 8772802: \"Aluminum (Al) is unquestionably neurotoxic in both experimental animals and certain human diseases. Minute quantities injected intracerebrally into rabbits will induce severe neurological symptoms and neuropathological features of neurodegeneration. Hyper-aluminemia often develops in patients with renal failure being treated with intermittent hemodialysis on a chronic basis, and in severe cases results in an encephalopathy. Uremic adults and premature infants not on dialysis treatment also can develop encephalopathy due to Al toxicity, as is the case when large amounts of alum are used as a urinary bladder irrigant. There are many other examples of Al-induced neurotoxicity; however, the question as to whether Al presents a health hazard to humans as a contributing factor to Alzheimer's disease is still the subject of debate. Several lines of evidence are presented that have formed the basis of the debate concerning the possible pathogenic role for Al in Alzheimer's disease. Important evidence for an Al-Alzheimer's causal relationship is the observation by laser microprobe mass analysis (LMMS) of the presence of Al in neurofibrillary tangles, although there are conflicting data on the extent of the Al deposition. The relatively poor sensitivity of some of the analytical instruments available for these challenging in situ microanalyses could explain the discrepant results, although LMMS and perhaps secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) appear to be sufficiently sensitive. Harmonization of the techniques is an essential next step. There is new evidence that exposure to Al from drinking water might result in cognitive impairment and an increased incidence of Alzheimer's disease. However, these epidemiological studies have inherent problems that must be scrutinized to determine if an association really does exist. An understanding of a possible enhanced bioavailability of Al in this type of exposure, versus other exposures such as antacid intake or industrial exposure, needs to be considered and explored. There has been one promising clinical trial of the treatment of Alzheimer's disease patients with the Al chelator desferrioxamine (DFO). Further studies are needed, and if confirmation is forthcoming then such data could also support an Al-Alzheimer's disease link as well as suggesting that DFO offers potential as a therapeutic agent. The possibility that iron might be the offending agent needs to be considered since DFO is a very strong iron chelator. The significance of Al-induced neurofibrillary degeneration in experimental animals should be assessed especially in light of new data showing that this model exhibits abnormally phosphorylated tau protein structures in the neuronal perikarya. Thus the key questions that must be answered before it can be asserted that Al possesses causal relationship to Alzheimer's disease, are as follows and are addressed in this present discussion: (1) Are there elevations of the concentration of Al in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients? (2) Is there a relationship between environmental exposure to Al, particularly in drinking water, and an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease? (3) Is treatment with DFO a potentially useful therapeutic approach and to what extent might beneficial effects of DFO implicate Al in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease? (4) Are there similarities between the experimental animal studies and Alzheimer's disease particularly in the development of abnormal forms of tau seen in neurofibrillary tangles? (5) Does Al promote the deposition of the A beta peptide in Alzheimer's disease? (6) Does hyperaluminemia associated with long-term hemodialysis treatment induce neurofibrillary degeneration? If the answer to each of these six questions is yes, then does this assert that Al possesses a causal relationship to Alzheimer's disease? On the other hand, must all six be met to be able to make this assertion?\", 23747787: StringElement('This study sought to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing complete revascularization (CR) versus incomplete revascularization (IR) in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'OBJECTIVE', u'Label': u'OBJECTIVES'}), 3185860: 'Using a dosing paradigm and an automated behavioral testing procedure designed to maximize potential drug efficacy, we evaluated the ability of clonidine to improve performance of aged monkeys on a trial-specific memory task.

Only two studies had prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study designs of rhGH treatment with a duration of 6 (n=15) and 12 months (n=62), respectively. Treatment with rhGH decreased total and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels by 4-8 and 11-16%, respectively, but did not alter high density lipoprotein or triglyceride levels. RhGH did not affect body mass index, but decreased waist circumference (by \\u223c3\\u200acm) and waist/hip ratio. RhGh did not consistently affect blood pressure or bone mineral density.

Aim of the study was to assess if and how CRT affects DF in systolic heart failure patients. We also investigated potential relations between CRT-induced left ventricular changes and the composite clinical endpoint of progressive heart failure and cardiac death over 3 years follow-up. 119 CRT patients underwent clinical evaluation and echocardiography before CRT and 4 months later. DF was quantified by transmitral velocities [E/A waves, deceleration time (DT), E/DT], early diastolic mitral annulus velocity (E'), E/E' ratio and 2-D speckle tracking strain rate during isovolumetric relaxation (IVR, SRivr). End-diastolic pressure-volume relationship (EDPVR) was also assessed noninvasively using a single-beat method.

However, its role in modulating drug resistance in other types of cancer is less well defined. The purpose of this review is to critically examine the evidence that P-gp plays an important role in producing drug resistance in astrocytic gliomas. Malignant astrocytoma is clinically resistant to most types of cytotoxic drugs, including those associated with the MDR phenotype and the cross-resistance patterns of short-term cultures derived from malignant glioma are consistent with this phenotype. Consequently, it might be expected that this tumor would express high levels of P-gp. However, immunohistochemical findings from a number of previous studies have provided conflicting data about the expression of P-gp in these tumors, although P-gp has been consistently detected in normal brain in the endothelial cells in cerebral blood vessels and is thought to contribute to the blood-brain barrier phenomena. In order to determine if P-gp contributes to drug resistance in malignant astrocytoma, we undertook a study of P-gp expression in a panel of short-term cultures derived from these tumors in which we determined the in vitro chemosensitivity. However, immunocytochemical studies with a panel of antibodies which recognize both internal and external epitopes of the P-gp molecule have consistently failed to show the characteristic membrane staining associated with MDR in any of the cultures, including those markedly cross-resistant to vincristine and doxorubicin. One antibody, JSB-1, showed heterogeneous granular cytoplasmic staining which was unrelated to a particular pattern of drug resistance. This is probably because this antibody cross-reacts with a widely distributed cytoplasmic antigen, pyruvate carboxylase, which is present in abundance in normal astrocytes. The unexpectedly poor specificities of many of the antibodies thought to be specific for P-gp is reviewed in the context of malignant astrocytoma. In conclusion, the role of P-gp in producing drug resistance in malignant astrocytoma is questionable and further studies might more profitably concentrate on the mechanisms of resistance to DNA-damaging agents like the nitrosoureas, methylating agents or platinum-based drugs.', 10208468: 'In collagenous colitis, the literature is conflicting concerning where in the colon the lesions are most likely to be present and most severe. Conflicting data furthermore shed doubt on the sensitivity of the histological detection of the morphological abnormalities and the threshold criteria for diagnosis. We addressed these questions in 56 patients with collagenous colitis. Two hundred ninety-one coded biopsy specimens were analyzed according to six standardized sites from cecum to rectum. Subepithelial collagen deposits were subjectively graded in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) sections and quantitatively measured in trichrome-stained sections, respectively. Semiquantitative grading was also done for inflammatory changes of the lamina propria and abnormalities of the surface and crypt epithelium. The transverse colon yielded the largest percentage of biopsy specimens (83%) interpreted as diagnostic of collagenous colitis and also had the largest percentage of biopsy specimens with inflammatory changes (98%). Biopsy specimens from both the rectosigmoid and the right colon (ascending and cecum) were significantly less likely to be diagnostic (P<.01). Only 66% of specimens obtained from the rectosigmoid were diagnostic, and 18% of these were interpreted as normal. Subepithelial collagen deposits proved to be significantly thicker in the transverse (median, 46.8 microm; range, 12 to 212.4) and descending (median, 49.2 microm; range, 6 to 230.4) than in the rectosigmoid (median, 33.6 microm; range, 9.6 to 178.8) and right colon (median, 35.4 microm; range, 6 to 140.4), respectively (P<.01).

There is major interest in therapeutic modulation of the IL-2 pathway to promote immune activation in the context of tumour immunotherapy or to enhance immune suppression in the context of transplantation, autoimmunity and inflammatory diseases. Antibody-mediated targeting of the high-affinity IL-2 receptor \\u03b1 chain (IL-2R\\u03b1 or CD25) offers a direct mechanism to target IL-2 biology and is being actively explored in the clinic. In mouse models, the rat anti-mouse CD25 clone PC61 has been used extensively to investigate the biology of IL-2 and Treg cells; however, there has been controversy and conflicting data on the exact in vivo mechanistic function of PC61. Engineering antibodies to alter Fc/Fc receptor interactions can significantly alter their in vivo function. In this study, we re-engineered the heavy chain constant region of an anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody to generate variants with highly divergent Fc effector function. Using these anti-CD25 Fc variants in multiple mouse models, we investigated the in vivo impact of CD25 blockade versus depletion of CD25(+) Treg cells on immune homeostasis. We report that immune homeostasis can be maintained during CD25 blockade but aberrant T-cell activation prevails when CD25(+) Treg cells are actively depleted. These results clarify the impact of PC61 on Treg cell biology and reveal an important distinction between CD25 blockade and depletion of CD25(+) Treg cells. These findings should inform therapeutic manipulation of the IL-2 pathway by targeting the high-affinity IL-2R.', 19379065: \"In this article, we review the impact of gender on the pathophysiology, management and outcomes after acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

This mutant could be complemented to Ps+ growth by cycA encoding the soluble cytochrome c2 but was unable to produce several c-type cytochromes. Only cytochrome c1 of the cytochrome bc1 complex was present in FJM13 cells grown on enriched medium, while cells grown on minimal medium contained at various levels all c-type cytochromes, including the membrane-bound electron carrier cytochrome cy. Complementation of FJM13 by a chromosomal library lacking cycA yielded a DNA fragment which also complemented a previously described Ps- mutant, MT113, known to lack all c-type cytochromes. Deletion and DNA sequence analyses revealed an open reading frame homologous to cycH, involved in cytochrome c biogenesis. The cycH gene product (CycH) is predicted to be a bipartite protein with membrane-associated amino-terminal (CycH1) and periplasmic carboxyl-terminal (CycH2) subdomains. Mutations eliminating CyCH drastically decrease the production or all known c-type cytochromes. However, mutations truncating only its CycH2 subdomain always produce cytochrome c1 and affect the presence of other cytochromes to different degrees in a growth medium-dependent manner. Thus, the subdomain CycH1 is sufficient for the proper maturation of cytochrome c1 which is the only known c-type cytochrome anchored to the cytoplasmic membrane by its carboxyl terminus, while CycH2 is required for efficient biogenesis of other c-type cytochromes. These findings demonstrate that the two subdomains of CycH play different roles in the biogenesis of topologically distinct c-type cytochromes and reconcile the apparently conflicting data previously obtained for other species.', 25257882: 'Altered bowel flora is currently thought to play a role in a variety of disease conditions, and the use of Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. as probiotics has been demonstrated to be health-promoting, even if the success of their administration depends on the applied bacterial strain(s) and the targeted disease. In the last few decades, specific probiotics have been shown to be effective in the treatment or the prevention of acute viral gastroenteritis, pediatric post-antibiotic-associated diarrhea, some pediatric allergic disorders, necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants, inflammatory bowel diseases and postsurgical pouchitis. The potential application of probiotics is continuously widening, with new evidence accumulating to support their effect on the prevention and treatment of other disease conditions, including several oral diseases, such as dental caries, periodontal diseases and oral malodor, as well as genitourinary and wound infections. Considering the increasingly widespread ability of pathogens to generate persistent biofilm-related infections, an even more attractive proposal is to administer probiotics to prevent or counteract biofilm development.

Conflicting data exist as to the possible renal origin of apoptotic cells in SLE patients with nephritis. We assessed the level of renal cell apoptosis in kidney biopsies from 35 patients with lupus nephritis by means of terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase (TdT)-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP)-digoxigenin nick end labeling (TUNEL). Five samples of normal kidney tissue served as control specimens. We did not observe apoptotic glomerular cells in any of the control or nephritis biopsies. Scarce apoptotic tubular cells were seen in 13 of 35 (37%) of the nephritis specimens and in two of five (40%) of the control sections. Within the SLE cohort, patients with TUNEL-positive tubular cells in their renal biopsies had significantly higher activity index scores for tubulointerstitial mononuclear cell infiltration than patients without apoptotic tubular cells in their biopsies (P = 0.01). Furthermore, the level of tubular cell apoptosis displayed a statistically significant, positive correlation with the activity index score for mononuclear cell infiltration (r(s) = 0.472, P = 0.004) but not with scores for other activity or chronicity index components. These observations indicate that the degree of tubular cell apoptosis correlates with the severity of tubulointerstitial inflammation in SLE-associated nephritis.

With the use of steroids, mortality has been reduced from 33 per cent to 7 per cent. The development of calcifications can be the most debilitating consequence of JDMS. It is our premise that JDMS is a distinct disease entity and that the increase in HLA-B8 and DR3 in JDMS suggests that genetic background may predispose to disease development.

In the present work, we review the most recent findings on this phenomenon, focusing on the predictive role of microbial translocation in HIV-related morbidity and mortality, the mechanisms by which it arises and potential therapeutic approaches. From a clinical perspective, current work has shown that markers of microbial translocation may be useful in predicting clinical events in untreated HIV infection, while conflicting data exist on their role in cART-experienced subjects, possibly due to the inclusion of extremely varied patient populations in cohort studies. Results from studies addressing the pathogenesis of microbial translocation have improved our knowledge of the damage of the gastrointestinal epithelial barrier occurring in HIV infection. However, the extent to which mucosal impairment translates directly to increased gastrointestinal permeability remains an open issue. In this respect, novel work has established a role for IL-17 and IL-22-secreting T cell populations in limiting microbial translocation and systemic T-cell activation/inflammation, thus representing a possible target of immune-therapeutic interventions shown to be promising in the animal model. Further, recent reports have not only confirmed the presence of a dysbiotic intestinal community in the course of HIV infection but have also shown that it may be linked to mucosal damage, microbial translocation and peripheral immune activation. Importantly, technical advances have also shed light on the metabolic activity of gut microbes, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic approaches to correct the function, as well as the composition, of the gastrointestinal microbiota.', 19336434: StringElement('Not all patients at risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD) are eligible for, or have access to implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation.

The biological intermediates studied most have been fecal bile acids; both human and animal studies suggest a tumor-promoting role of bile acids in the development of colon tumors, although there are conflicting data from human studies.

If short-chain fatty acids explained the tumor-inhibiting properties of dietary fiber, the readily fermentable fibers such as guar and pectin would be more protective than cellulose and wheat bran, which has not been observed. Because these two hypotheses do not adequately explain modulation of tumor growth by dietary fiber, investigation of other intermediates is indicated.

Specificity of probes was tested on liver and stomach control tissue, as well as tissue from class IV ADH knock-out mice.

Lung penetration studies are commonly conducted with new antimicrobial agents to elucidate their potential utility in treating such infections. Although some very useful information may emerge, these studies are complicated by technical difficulties, theoretical assumptions, and numerous intricacies. Many studies describing quinolone penetration into saliva, sputum, bronchial secretions, and lung tissue have been published. In general, quinolone concentrations in lung tissue are 1.5-4 times the serum levels, whereas those in sputum and bronchial secretion are equal to or less than serum, and penetration into saliva is even less. The failure rate predicted from saliva, sputum, and bronchial secretion penetration and marginal in vitro activity of quinolones against streptococci does not consistently correlate with clinical efficacy data. In light of such conflicting data and the high lung tissue penetration of quinolones, the relevance of saliva, sputum, and bronchial secretion studies should be reevaluated. The utility of investigational quinolones in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections can be determined only by well-designed clinical trials.', 12766472: 'Mitochondrial dysfunction has been shown to participate in the induction of apoptosis and has even been suggested to be central to the apoptotic pathway. Indeed, opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore has been demonstrated to induce depolarization of the transmembrane potential (deltapsi(m)), release of apoptogenic factors and loss of oxidative phosphorylation. In some apoptotic systems, loss of deltapsi(m) may be an early event in the apoptotic process. However, there are emerging data suggesting that, depending on the model of apoptosis, the loss of deltapsi(m) may not be an early requirement for apoptosis, but on the contrary may be a consequence of the apoptotic-signaling pathway. Furthermore, to add to these conflicting data, loss of deltapsi(m) has been demonstrated to not be required for cytochrome c release, whereas release of apoptosis inducing factor AIF is dependent upon disruption of deltapsi(m) early in the apoptotic pathway. Together, the existing literature suggests that depending on the cell system under investigation and the apoptotic stimuli used, dissipation of deltapsi(m) may or may not be an early event in the apoptotic pathway. Discrepancies in this area of apoptosis research may be attributed to the fluorochromes used to detect deltapsi(m). Differential degrees of sensitivity of these fluorochromes exist, and there are also important factors that contribute to their ability to accurately discriminate changes in deltapsi(m).', 29494538: 'This narrative systematic review evaluates growing evidence of an association between low maternal vitamin D status and increased risk of hypertensive disorders. The inclusion of interventional, observational, and dietary studies on vitamin D and all hypertensive disorders of pregnancy is a novel aspect of this review, providing a unique contribution to an intensively-researched area that still lacks a definitive conclusion. To date, trial evidence supports a protective effect of combined vitamin D and calcium supplementation against preeclampsia. Conflicting data for an association of vitamin D with gestational hypertensive disorders in observational studies arises from a number of sources, including large heterogeneity between study designs, lack of adherence to standardized perinatal outcome definitions, variable quality of analytical data for 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), and inconsistent data reporting of vitamin D status. While evidence does appear to lean towards an increased risk of gestational hypertensive disorders at 25(OH)D concentrations <50 nmol/L, caution should be exercised with dosing in trials, given the lack of data on long-term safety. The possibility that a fairly narrow target range for circulating 25(OH)D for achievement of clinically-relevant improvements requires further exploration.

We are interested in the role of Ca2+-permeable non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor channels during differentiation of retinal ganglion cells. However, in view of the conflicting data on the relative Ca2+ permeability of non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor channels in these neurons, a more systematic evaluation of permeation properties of different Na+ substitutes was necessary before proceeding with the main goal of the present study evaluating the effects of non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation on repetitive firing and voltage-activated K+ and Ca2+ conductances. Retinal ganglion cells were dissociated from the rat retina on postnatal day 5. They were selected by vital anti-Thy-1 immunostaining and repetitive firing behaviour and submitted to patch-clamp recording in the whole-cell configuration. Non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor channels were activated by application of amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid or kainate. It was found that they were essentially impermeable to N-methyl-D-glucamine (P(NMDG)/P(Cs)<0.02), but not to choline (P(choline)/P(Cs)=0.24) and tetramethylammonium (P(TMA)/P(Cs)=0.23). When using N-methyl-D-glucamine as a substitute for Na+ to obtain bi-ionic conditions P(Ca)/P(Cs) varied between 0.08 to 1.40. Linear current voltage relation or little outward rectification corresponded to a low Ca2+ permeability (P(Ca)/P(Cs)=0.14). In about one third of the cells kainate-induced currents showed inward rectification and non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor agonists induced a substantially higher Ca2+ influx (P(Ca)/P(Cs)=0.64). Activation of non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors by kainate profoundly altered the repetitive discharge of retinal ganglion cells. In contrast to the continuously firing controls, cells generated only a few spikes at the beginning of a steady depolarization after kainate exposure. Among the candidates regulating the firing behaviour of retinal ganglion cells voltage-activated Ca2+ and K+ conductances were tested for their sensitivity to kainate application. It was found that even short conditioning pulses of kainate decreased the peak amplitudes of both voltage-activated K+ and voltage-activated Ca2+ currents. Only the latter effect required extracellular Ca2+ and was antagonized by increasing the intracellular Ca2+ buffering strength. Thus, suppression of calcium currents was induced by a non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated rise of the intracellular calcium concentration. The reduction of K+ currents did not depend on extracellular calcium and was insensitive to experimental manipulation of intracellular Ca2+ buffer strength. The interaction between Ca2+-permeable non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor channels and voltage-activated Ca2+ and K+ currents may represent an important regulatory mechanism to control the repetitive firing of developing retinal ganglion cells.', 26733840: StringElement('Conflicting data exist on sensitivity changes of the melanocortin system during diet-induced obesity.

We measured upper airway calibre using acoustic reflection in 60 men and 54 women (median 35, range 16-74 yrs) both seated and supine. All upper airway dimensions, except oropharyngeal junction (OPJ), decreased with increasing age in both men and women (r > -0.24, p < or = 0.05) while supine (r2 > 0.06).

These receptors are thought to play an important role in metabolic diseases such as obesity, insulin resistance, and coronary artery disease. Three subtypes of PPAR receptors have been described: PPAR\\u03b1, PPAR\\u03b4/\\u03b2, and PPAR\\u03b3. PPAR\\u03b1 is found in the liver, muscle, kidney, and heart. In the liver, its role is to up-regulate genes involved in fatty acid uptake, binding, \\u03b2-oxidation and electron transport, and oxidative phosphorylation in subcutaneous fat but not in skeletal muscle. PPAR\\u03b4/\\u03b2 is expressed in many tissues but markedly in brain, adipose tissue, and skin. PPAR\\u03b3 has high expression in fat, low expression in the liver, and very low expression in the muscle. The thiazolidinediones (TZD) are synthetic ligands of PPAR\\u03b3. By activating a number of genes in tissues, PPAR\\u03b3 increases glucose and lipid uptake, increases glucose oxidation, decreases free fatty acid concentration, and decreases insulin resistance. Although, there is a rationale for the use of TZDs in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, clinical studies have produced conflicting data. While currently used TZDs are clearly associated with heart failure (HF) worsening; with regards to cardiovascular outcomes, pioglitazone seems to be related to a trend toward reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, whereas rosiglitazone may actually increase risk of cardiovascular events. We review the existing literature on TZDs and discuss role and cardiovascular safety of these agents for the contemporary treatment of diabetes.

However, in vitro studies and adoptive transfer experiments provided conflicting data as to whether this phenotype is caused by a functional defect resulting from SAP deficiency in T cells, B cells, or both. Here, we ascertained which cell types are responsible for this humoral immunity defect by using a conditional gene targeting approach. We also thoroughly examined the expression pattern of SAP in normal immune cells by using intracellular flow cytometry. The results showed that expression of SAP in T cells, but not in B cells or NK cells, is required and sufficient for SAP-dependent antibody production and GC formation.

A second group of thirty-four patients received induction, intensification and re-induction phases of treatment. The results suggest that intensification of therapy does not alter median survival or median duration of remission, although a trend towards more long term disease-free survivors is observed.', 18926877: \"Studies have indicated that nicotine has disease-modifying and cognitive-enhancing properties in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nicotine has been proposed to be neuroprotective through anti-amyloid beta (Abeta) effects, anti-excitotoxic effects, and anti-free radical effects. Previously, conflicting data from Abeta plaque developing transgenic mice have shown significant Abeta-lowering effects, or alternatively no effects, of nicotine administration. In this study, dosing of transgenic mice (J20 strain) with mutated human APP (Swedish mutations: K670N and M671L and Indiana mutation: V717F) transgene, with nicotine in drinking water for 20 weeks did not have a significant effect on total levels of Abeta 40 or 42 in hippocampus or cortex. This treatment strategy resulted in increased levels of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor activity, and reduced levels of cortical glial fibrillary acidic protein, but had no effect on cortical synaptophysin protein levels. The J20 mouse strain produces higher levels of Abeta 42, the more pathogenic form of Abeta, than Abeta 40 compared to other Abeta plaque developing mouse strains; this could account for differences in effectiveness of nicotine in transgenic mice models of AD.\", 11898075: 'Considerations about the relation between benefit and expenses are also gaining increasing importance in interventional radiology. This review aims at providing a survey about the published data concerning economical analyses of some of the more frequently employed interventions in radiology excluding neuroradiological and coronary interventions. Because of the relative scarcity of literature in this field, all identified articles (n = 46) were included without selection for methodological quality. For a number of radiological interventions the cost-effectiveness has already been demonstrated, e. g., PTA of femoropopliteal and iliac artery stenoses, stenting of renal artery stenoses, placement of vena-cava filters, as well as metal stents in malignant biliary and esophageal obstructions. Conflicting data exist for the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms. So far, no analysis could be found that directly compares bypass surgery versus PTA + stent in iliac arteries.', 18662694: 'Circulating endothelial cells (CEC) are currently proposed as a potential biomarker for measuring the impact of anti-angiogenic treatments in cancer. However, the lack of consensus on the appropriate method of CEC measurement has led to conflicting data in cancer patients. A validated assay adapted for evaluating the clinical utility of CEC in large cohorts of patients undergoing anti-angiogenic treatments is needed. We developed a four-color flow cytometric assay to measure CEC as CD31(+), CD146(+), CD45(-), 7-amino-actinomycin-D (7AAD)(-) events in whole blood. The distinctive features of the assay are: (1) staining of 1 ml whole blood, (2) use of a whole blood IgPE control to measure accurately background noise, (3) accumulation of a large number of events (almost 5 10(6)) to ensure statistical analysis, and (4) use of 10 microm fluorescent microbeads to evaluate the event size. Assay reproducibility was determined in duplicate aliquots of samples drawn from 20 metastatic cancer patients. Assay linearity was tested by spiking whole blood with low numbers of HUVEC. Five-color flow cytometric experiments with CD144 were performed to confirm the endothelial origin of the cells. CEC were measured in 20 healthy individuals and 125 patients with metastatic cancer. Reproducibility was good between duplicate aliquots (r(2)=0.948, mean difference between duplicates of 0.86 CEC/ml). Detected HUVEC correlated with spiked HUVEC (r(2)=0.916, mean recovery of 100.3%). Co-staining of CD31, CD146 and CD144 confirmed the endothelial nature of cells identified as CEC. Median CEC levels were 6.5/ml (range, 0-15) in healthy individuals and 15.0/ml (range, 0-179) in patients with metastatic carcinoma (p<0.001). The assay proposed here allows reproducible and sensitive measurement of CEC by flow cytometry and could help evaluate CEC as biomarkers of anti-angiogenic therapies in large cohorts of patients.', 2663719: \"Animal experiments using, in addition to asbestos, erionite and manmade mineral fibres, have confirmed that fibre dimension is an important factor in the carcinogenic potency of fibres. However, it seems to be established that it is not the only parameter of importance and that fibre type and physicochemistry play a role. In vitro experiments have provided new information on the relationship between fibre size and effect: long, thin fibres are more effective in inducing the transformation of certain cell types and in producing injury arising from oxygen species. Different in vitro experiments have tested chromosomal and genetic damage induced by fibres, especially asbestos. Depending on the cell type, chromosomal damage and aneuploidy have been observed and interactions with the genomic material have been demonstrated. Some conflicting data in this area might be explained by differences in cell type used or in methods used to prepare the asbestos samples. At present, a working hypothesis for the mechanisms of carcinogenesis induced by fibres can be suggested. Mineral or synthetic fibres deposited in the lung are first processed by macrophages, which eliminate short fibres. The remaining fibres may be ingested by cells that are potentially transformable, the longest fibres possibly being phagocytosed preferentially. Ingested fibres may produce DNA damage in both resting and dividing cells, either by the direct production of oxygen radicals, by the formation of clastogenic factor or by direct chromosome interaction in cells in mitosis. A missegregation of chromosomes can result from interactions between fibres and the mitotic spindle. Even if these processes take place slowly, they can occur over a long period of time due to the persistence of the fibres in the tissue. The carcinogenic potency of a fibre, therefore, will be dependent on its durability, its dimensions and its physicochemical properties. Asbestos fibres appear to be pluripotent in inducing chromosome abnormalities as well as some responses shared with compounds such as promoters. Thus, these fibres can be considered as potent complete carcinogens. The potency of a given fibre in a specific target tissue will be the sum of both its initiating and its promoting effects. It seems that new concepts must be formulated to account for the mechanisms of action of fibres. 'Particulate state' carcinogenesis includes the possibility of multiple hits occurring during the time that the particles remain within the target tissue and will therefore be time-dependent.\", 27766057: u'Inhibitors are the most serious side effect of haemophilia treatment; they occur in 25-30\\xa0% of all patients with severe haemophilia A. Over the last 2 decades, conflicting data on the impact of clotting products have been published. Due to small studies of selected cases, appreciation of the impact of any particular product has been difficult. Moreover, the emphasis on inhibitor testing has led to increased detection of low-titre inhibitors (to >10\\xa0%), while the percentage of high-titre inhibitors is still around 20\\xa0%. Other non-genetic risk factors, such as dosing and intensive treatment, are able to increase individual inhibitor risk. Early prophylaxis might reduce inhibitor risk. Well-defined large PUP studies including products should be considered. This can only be achieved in collaboration with all stakeholders. In conclusion, while the impact of FVIII products on inhibitor development is large, presently the actual impact of any specific product is unclear.', 11025706: StringElement('The incidence of prostate cancer in Saudi Arabia has been reported to be low at 1.4 to 2.1/100,000 person-years.

Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), a key enzyme in the catabolism of 5-fluorouracil, has been intensively investigated in relation to fluoropyrimidine toxicity, and several DPD gene (DPYD) polymorphisms are associated with decreased enzyme activity and increased risk of fluoropyrimidine-related toxicity. In patients carrying non-functional DPYD variants (c.1905+1G>A, c.1679T>G, c.2846A>T), fluoropyrimidines should be avoided or reduced according to the patients' homozygous or heterozygous status, respectively. For other common DPYD variants (c.496A>G, c.1129-5923C>G, c.1896T>C), conflicting data are reported and their use in clinical practice still needs to be validated. The high frequency of DPYD polymorphism and the lack of large prospective trials may explain differences in studies' results. The epigenetic regulation of DPD expression has been recently investigated to explain the variable activity of the enzyme. DPYD promoter methylation and its regulation by microRNAs may affect the toxicity risk of fluoropyrimidines. The studies we reviewed indicate that pharmacogenetic testing is promising to direct personalised dosing of fluoropyrimidines, although further investigations are needed to establish the role of DPD in severe toxicity in patients treated for colorectal cancer.\", 25204013: 'There are limited and conflicting data from clinical trials concerning the beneficial effects of magnesium supplementation on diabetic patients. We investigated the effects of magnesium supplementation on metabolic control and insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetic patients with normomagnesemia. A total of 98 normomagnesemic subjects with type 2 diabetes were enrolled in a randomized, crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Participants were randomly assigned to receive magnesium lactate (360 mg elemental magnesium) or placebo for three months, followed by a three-month washout period. Treatment assignments were then reversed over an additional three months of follow-up. The primary endpoint was a reduction in fasting glucose and HbA1c. A total of 56 subjects completed the follow-up in the magnesium and placebo supplementation groups. Urinary magnesium excretion was increased following magnesium supplementation in the intervention group compared with the placebo group (p = 0.0002). Fasting glucose, HbA1c, insulin and HOMA-IR, as well as lipid profile, did not change significantly during treatment. We concluded that magnesium supplementation does not improve metabolic control or insulin sensitivity in diabetic subjects with normomagnesemia.', 26084654: u'Limited and conflicting data are available about the association between short-term blood pressure (BP) variability and urinary albumin excretion rate (uAER). The objective of our study was to analyze the relationships between microalbuminuria (MAU), defined as an uAER between 20 and 200\\u2009\\u03bcg\\u2009min(-1), and short-term BP variability (BPV), assessed as average real variability (ARV), weighted s.d. of 24-h BP and as s.d. of daytime and night-time BP. The study population consisted of 315 untreated essential hypertensives with normal estimated glomerular filtration rate (>60\\u2009ml\\u2009min(-1) per 1.73\\u2009m(2)), who underwent 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring and 24-h uAER determination. MAU was detected in 82 (26%) patients.

This difference held (P=0.026) after adjustment for age, mean levels of BP and other potential confounders by analysis of covariance. A statistically significant correlation was also found between ARV of 24-h SBP and uAER (r=0.17; P=0.003). This association remained significant (\\u03b2=0.15; P=0.01), also taking into account the effect of 24-h average systolic and diastolic BP, age, gender, diabetes, serum uric acid, triglycerides, estimated glomerular filtration rate in multiple regression analyses. All the other indices of short-term BPV tested were not independently associated with MAU. Our results seem to suggest that in essential hypertension, short-term BPV, only when estimated by ARV of 24-h SBP, is independently associated with MAU.', 22291764: StringElement('Previous studies have shown that obese individuals have reduced natriuretic peptide levels.

NO concentrations in exhaled breath are increased in asthmatics and increased NO levels correlate with worsening airway inflammation and asthma symptoms. The multiple roles of NO in the lung have not been delineated clearly. Clinical trials are being performed presently that test the apparently conflicting hypotheses that either donors or inhibitors of NO in the lung are effective strategies for treating asthma. These strategies evolved, in part, from results of pre-clinical studies performed in mice and other animal models. This review evaluates the existing literature with regard to mouse models of asthma and explores the often conflicting data on the role of NO, the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) enzymes, and the arginase enzymes in allergic airway inflammation. While we will emphasize the ovalbumin exposure mouse model, we will also examine other models. Where inconsistencies are identified among the studies, we attempt to determine whether such inconsistencies arise from methodological differences or alternative mechanisms. Ultimately, we address whether the allergen-exposed mouse is a suitable model for identifying promising new drugs for the treatment of human asthma. While a consensus is building that NO is beneficial or protective in subsets of asthmatics, results from studies using mouse models to investigate the individual roles of NO and the NOS enzymes in airway inflammation are often contradictory. Further research efforts with this model will allow us to distinguish which asthma patients may benefit best from NO donors and which may benefit from NO inhibitors.', 28570936: 'The progesterone receptor modulator, Ulipristal acetate (UPA) has proven to be an effective emergency contraceptive. Conflicting data has been reported that suggests different efficacy of the drug in different populations, which may be explained by the systemic exposure to the drug. A UPLC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for the accurate and sensitive measurement of UPA in human serum to address this matter. UPA was extracted from human serum using liquid-liquid extraction with a combination of hexane and dichloromethane. An analytical platform comprising reverse-phase chromatographic separation followed by mass spectrometric detection by positive electrospray ionization in multiple reaction monitoring was used for quantitation of UPA within 7min. The method was linear from 0.1 to 250ng/mL. The matrix effect was minimal and intra- and inter-assay precision and accuracy were all within the acceptable limits.

Measurement of progesterone receptors using the synthetic progestin, R5020, has led to conflicting data both with regard to the presence of progesterone receptor during certain developmental stages of the mammary gland and the ability of the glucocorticoids to compete for specific R5020 binding sites. In this report we have identified experimental conditions which allow for the separate measurements of the progesterone and glucocorticoid receptors in the same cytosol. If sulfhydryl reducing agents such as dithiothreitol are excluded from the assay buffer, R5020 binds to only a single class of high affinity sites in mammary cytosol of virgin mice and these binding sites exhibit a strict steroid specificity characteristic of progesterone receptors. In contrast, if dithiothreitol is included in the buffers, R5020 binds not only to the high affinity sites but also to certain saturable lower affinity sites; these lower affinity sites for R5020 also bind glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone. These findings should facilitate more accurate quantitation of both progesterone and glucocorticoid receptors in normal and neoplastic tissues and also be applicable to studies on the mechanism(s) of progesterone action.', 12614976: 'Onychomycosis is a common medical condition in patients with diabetes. Conflicting data exist as to whether diabetes predisposes patients to the disease. Controversy notwithstanding, patients with diabetes have several medical conditions (obesity, peripheral neuropathy, and retinopathy) that can inhibit the identification or mask the progression of fungal nail infections. In addition, vascular insufficiency, impaired wound healing, and compromised immunologic status associated with diabetic foot increase the risk of secondary infections in diabetic patients with onychomycosis. Such factors contribute to an increased morbidity and decreased quality of life in these patients and underscore the need for effective antifungal treatment. Oral antifungal agents are generally well tolerated, but serious adverse events independent of or associated with a number of significant drug interactions have been reported. The availability of a topical therapy, ciclopirox topical solution, 8% (Penlac Nail Lacquer), provides clinicians with an additional effective and well-tolerated treatment option. In order to further increase the efficacy of topical or oral treatment, mechanical intervention (e.g., debridement) may be combined with either of these options. Choice of appropriate treatment and careful monitoring of fungal nail infections can prevent significant morbidity in patients with diabetes.', 99649: 'Information from both published and unpublished sources considered relevant to the understanding of the genetic toxicology of chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins is summarized in this review. Interest in writing this paper was stimulated by the fact that this class of compounds, particularly 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), has gained notoriety as an extreme environmental and industrial hazard. The potential for human exposure occurs in the work place when dioxins are formed during the synthesis of a number of commercially important compounds such as 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid, hexachlorophene, and pentachlorophenol. Environmental contamination may result from manufacturing processes and from dioxin contaminants in marketed products. Research on dioxins as potential mutagens was initiated because of their structural similarity to acridines, a class of known intercalating agents. To date, only 4 dioxin compounds have been evaluated for mutagenicity: the di-, tetra-, and octa-chlorinated derivatives and the unsubstituted dibenzo-p-dioxin. Since only a few of the many possible structural forms of dioxins have been tested, no definite conclusions can be made about their potential mutagenicity. Furthermore, the positive mutagenicity and cytological effects reported thus far with the few dioxin isomers examined seems to depend on the position of chlorine substitution. The most active form of the molecule is the 2,3,7,8-derivative (TCDD). Data available for assessing the mutagenic potential of TCDD are conflicting and scarce. Differences in testing results reported in these studies could be attributed to solubility problems with the test chemical, treatment protocols, purity of test samples, or toxicity. Because there are conflicting data, additional experiments are needed before the mutagenic potential of TCDD and other dioxins can be determined. Studies exploring the promoting effect of dioxins on the mutagenicity of other compounds are also recommended because experiments have shown TCDD to be an extremely active liver enzyme inducing agent that enhances the mutagenicity of certain polycyclic hydrocarbons such as 3-methylcholanthrene in vitro. The importance of discerning the hazards to human health from dioxin compounds became apparent after an accidental release of TCDD from a chemical plant contaminated the Seveso, Italy area in July 1976. This accident revealed that insufficient data were available to properly evaluate the long-term health risks posed by dioxin compounds. Several research projects were therefore initiated after the Seveso incident; it is hoped that many of the questions concerning the mutagenicity of TCDD and possibly of other dioxin congeners will be answered as a result of this work.', 8060226: \"There are conflicting data regarding the detection of t(14;18) in reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (RLH) by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Although most studies have not detected t(14;18), several groups have definitively shown that a very low number of cells with this translocation (one in 10(5) to 10(6)) are present in a significant proportion of follicular hyperplasias. Review of the methods from these series reveals that modifications of the PCR assay (ie, enhanced sensitivity steps such as seminesting, lengthy autoradiographic exposure times, multiple aliquot reactions of single samples, and/or high concentrations of template DNA) are probably necessary to detect t(14;18) in RLH. We evaluated a diverse set of 111 RLH (85 lymph nodes, 22 tonsils, and four other sites) from patients of different age groups (age range, 9 months to 80 years) to determine if a standard PCR assay would amplify t(14;18). Of these, 61 (55%) specimens had a prominent follicular hyperplastic component. Fifty-seven follicular lymphomas served as a control group. Polymerase chain reaction was performed as a single-run, two-primer-based assay for major breakpoint region bcl-2 translocations (5' major breakpoint region primer and 3' immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene-joining region consensus primer). Two different types of thermocyclers were employed. A metal block thermocycler was used with 35 cycles of amplification on 500 ng to 1 micrograms of genomic DNA, and a separate air thermocycler was used with 45 cycles of amplification on 50 ng of genomic DNA. Product detection was carried out through ethidium bromide staining and UV gel illumination, along with a digoxigenin-alkaline phosphatase-based, internal major breakpoint region oligonucleotide probe system. We found no amplified t(14;18) products in any RLH. In contrast, 36 (63%) of 57 follicular lymphomas showed t(14;18) (published range for detection of major breakpoint region translocations by PCR, 31% to 74%). Moreover, the assay's sensitivity, estimated through dilution studies, was to one in 10(4) to 10(5) cells. Although theoretically possible, our data suggest that there is practically no risk of amplifying a t(14;18) from RLH when utilizing a standard PCR assay.\", 21689667: 'Benzo[a]pyrene (BP) and dibenzo[a,l]pyrene (DBP) are two polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that exhibit distinctly different mutagenicity and carcinogenicity profiles. Although some studies show that these PAHs produce unstable DNA adducts, conflicting data and arguments have been presented regarding the relative roles of these unstable adducts versus stable adducts, as well as oxidative damage, in the mutagenesis and tumor-mutation spectra of these PAHs. However, no study has determined the mutation spectra along with the stable and unstable DNA adducts in the same system with both PAHs. Thus, we determined the mutagenic potencies and mutation spectra of BP and DBP in strains TA98, TA100 and TA104 of Salmonella, and we also measured the levels of abasic sites (aldehydic-site assay) and characterized the stable DNA adducts ((32)P-postlabeling/HPLC) induced by these PAHs in TA104. Our results for the mutation spectra and site specificity of stable adducts were consistent with those from other systems, showing that DBP was more mutagenic than BP in TA98 and TA100. The mutation spectra of DBP and BP were significantly different in TA98 and TA104, with 24% of the mutations induced by BP in TA98 being complex frameshifts, whereas DBP produced hardly any of these mutations. In TA104, BP produced primarily GC to TA transversions, whereas DBP produced primarily AT to TA transversions. The majority (96%) of stable adducts induced by BP were at guanine, whereas the majority (80%) induced by DBP were at adenine. Although BP induced abasic sites, DBP did not. Most importantly, the proportion of mutations induced by DBP at adenine and guanine paralleled the proportion of stable DNA adducts induced by DBP at adenine and guanine; however, this was not the case for BP. Our results leave open a possible role for unstable DNA adducts in the mutational specificity of BP but not for DBP.', 20538692: StringElement('Conflicting data have been obtained on optimal plasma magnesium concentrations for clinical outcomes in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'OBJECTIVE', u'Label': u'BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE'}), 17134918: StringElement('Several risk factors for sudden unexplained death in epilepsy patients (SUDEP) have been proposed, but subsequent work has yielded conflicting data.

While the majority of former studies showed a benefit of n-3 FA acid intake, recent clinical trials using n-3 supplements on top of established medication and prudent nutrition did not confirm these findings. The conflicting data may be due to several factors such as the selection of study population with different sizes or characteristics as well as choosing different doses or types of n-3 FA.

In addition to well studied fungal Cyps, a number of plant Cyps were identified as allergens (e.g. Bet v 7 from birch pollen, Cat r 1 from periwinkle pollen). However, there are conflicting data regarding their antigenic/allergenic cross-reactivity, with no plant Cyp allergen structures available for comparison. Because amino acid residues are fairly conserved between plant and fungal Cyps, it is particularly interesting to check whether they can cross-react. Cat r 1 was identified by immunoblotting using allergic patients' sera followed by N-terminal sequencing. Cat r 1 (\\u223c 91% sequence identity to Bet v 7) was cloned from a cDNA library and expressed in Escherichia coli. Recombinant Cat r 1 was utilized to confirm peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans-isomerase (PPIase) activity by a PPIase assay and the allergenic property by an IgE-specific immunoblotting and rat basophil leukemia cell (RBL-SX38) mediator release assay. Inhibition-ELISA showed cross-reactive binding of serum IgE from Cat r 1-allergic individuals to fungal allergenic Cyps Asp f 11 and Mala s 6.

An increasing body of evidence implies that TNF-\\u03b1 plays a critical role in muscle atrophy in a number of these clinical settings. The mechanisms mediating its effects are not completely understood and conflicting data regarding its anabolic and catabolic actions exists. To examine the functional significance and detailed morphological characteristics of TNF-\\u03b1-induced muscle proteolysis, differentiated L6 myotubes were subjected to increasing concentrations of recombinant TNF-\\u03b1 for 24 and 48 h. Data analysis of cell death showed that TNF-\\u03b1 induced a combination of apoptosis and necrosis in high concentrations. TNF-R1, rather than TNF-R2, was significantly upregulated. In addition, the transcription factors, NF-\\u03baB and FKHR were rapidly activated thus leading to increased expression of ubiquitin ligases, MuRF-1 and MAFbx. Muscle fiber diameter decreased with increasing TNF-\\u03b1 concentrations and was associated with attenuation of the PI3-K/Akt pathway as well as significant reductions in differentiation markers. Furthermore, treatment of L6 myotubes with exogenous TNF-\\u03b1 strongly potentiates its proteolytic effects through certain MAPKs that are activated. These observations suggest that TNF-\\u03b1 induces muscle proteolysis in a dose-dependent manner via various signal transduction pathways.', 19299662: 'Aspirin has been a commercial drug for over a century, although for most of this history, an understanding of its mechanism of action, as an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (COX) activity and thus of prostanoid synthesis, was lacking. Over the past fifty years, a large number of other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been developed, and a much deeper understanding of inflammation and prostanoid action has emerged. Indeed, a new class of selective inhibitors of the cyclooxygenase-2 isozyme was introduced, about ten years ago, and these so-called coxibs quickly became regarded as preferable, in certain clinical contexts, to avoid side effects associated with the use of aspirin and previously developed NSAIDs. This regard for coxibs has been challenged, sometimes infamously, as cardiovascular events associated with coxib use have become apparent.

Intravenous naloxone (0.015 mg/kg) injected 5 min after midazolam did not change any measured respiratory or hemodynamic variable. We conclude that the respiratory effects of midazolam are poorly dose related and not reversed by naloxone. The observed compensatory increase in respiratory frequency which is not noted in other studies, is probably related to the noninvasive measurement technique used.', 12497099: 'The use of maximum androgen blockade (MAB) in advanced prostate cancer remains controversial due to conflicting data from clinical trials. Some of the trials that report no advantage of MAB over monotherapy have been criticized on a number of points, including a lack of statistical power and too short a follow-up period. Three randomized trials, SWOG-INT 0036, EORTC-30853 and the Anandron Study Group Trial, report a survival advantage and a longer time to disease progression with MAB, although only one reaches statistical significance. The widespread use of MAB is controversial on the basis of the available clinical data. It has been suggested that three clinical situations exist for its use in advanced cancer: in symptomatic disease; as neoadjuvant therapy prior to radiotherapy; and for the prevention of flare following the use of luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone analogues as monotherapy. Case studies are presented in this article involving the use of MAB in these circumstances, as well as its use under other conditions. MAB fits into an algorithm of progressive step-up therapy and by tailoring hormonal therapy to individual patients and their tumours we may improve survival and define further the future role of MAB.

However, conflicting data exist regarding their effectiveness. Prior systematic reviews examined contact precautions as part of a larger bundled approach, limiting ability to understand their effectiveness. The aim of this review was to characterize the effectiveness of contact precautions alone against transmission of any MDRO among adult acute care patients. Directed by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement, comprehensive searches of four electronic scientific literature databases were conducted for studies published in English from January 2004 to June 2014. Studies were included if interventional, original research, evaluating contact isolation precautions against MDRO transmission among inpatients. Searches returned 284 studies, six of which were included in the review. These studies measured four different MDROs with one study showing a reduction in transmission. Whereas studies were of high quality regarding outcome operationalization and statistical analyses, overall quality was moderate to low due to poor intervention description, population characterization and potential biases. Where compliance was measured (N = 4), it presented a threat to validity because it included select parts of the intervention, ranged from 21% to 87%, and was significantly different across study phases (N = 2). The poor quality of evidence on this topic continues to limit interpretation of these data. Hence, this conflicting body of literature does not constitute evidence for or against contact precautions. We recommend that researchers consider power calculation, compliance monitoring, non-equivalent concurrent controls when designing future studies on this topic.', 7863640: 'Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common disorder which may result in esophageal ulcers, erosions, strictures and motility disorders if it is not treated promptly.

There is increasing understanding about the pathogenesis of placental dysfunction in inherited thrombophilia and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome pregnancy outcomes in these conditions parallel those reported for MPDs.

Disruption of this subtle equilibrium can lead to the onset of leukemia, an increase in the number of lymphocytes being potentially due to both of these parameters. The relative importance of cell proliferation vs. apoptosis during pathogenesis induced by the primate T cell lymphotropic viruses and bovine leukemia virus (BLV) has been difficult to assess because of conflicting data from a range of in vitro and ex vivo experimental systems. Here, we aim to resolve this issue by measuring the rates of cell proliferation and death in the BLV-ovine system, an animal model of human T lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1). We use a method based on the i.v. injection of 5-bromodeoxyuridine into BLV-infected sheep. We show that B lymphocytes in BLV(+) asymptomatic sheep proliferate significantly faster than in uninfected controls (average proliferation rate: 0.020 per day vs. 0.011 per day). In contrast, the rates of cell death were not significantly different between aleukemic BLV-infected and control sheep (average death rate 0.089 per day vs. 0.094 per day, respectively). We conclude that the increase in the number of B cells during BLV-induced lymphocytosis results from higher proliferation rates but is not due to a significant decrease in apoptosis, in contrast to data from in vitro (ex vivo) experiments. The imbalance created by the net increase in proliferation in the absence of compensating cell death reveals a complex mechanism of feedback regulation controlling homeostasis in the blood compartment.', 21753184: u'The F508del mutation, the most frequent in cystic fibrosis (CF), impairs the maturation of the CFTR chloride channel. The F508del defect can be partially overcome at low temperature (27\\xb0C) or with pharmacological correctors. However, the efficacy of correctors on the mutant protein appears to be dependent on the cell expression system. We have used a bronchial epithelial cell line, CFBE41o-, to determine the efficacy of various known treatments and to discover new correctors. Compared with other cell types, CFBE41o- shows the largest response to low temperature and the lowest one to correctors such as corr-4a and VRT-325. A screening of a small-molecule library identified 9-aminoacridine and ciclopirox, which were significantly more effective than corr-4a and VRT-325. Analysis with microarrays revealed that 9-aminoacridine, ciclopirox, and low temperature, in contrast to corr-4a, cause a profound change in cell transcriptome. These data suggest that 9-aminoacridine and ciclopirox act on F508del-CFTR maturation as proteostasis regulators, a mechanism already proposed for the histone deacetylase inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA). However, we found that 9-aminoacridine, ciclopirox, and SAHA, in contrast to corr-4a, VRT-325, and low temperature, do not increase chloride secretion in primary bronchial epithelial cells from CF patients. These conflicting data appeared to be correlated with different gene expression signatures generated by these treatments in the cell line and in primary bronchial epithelial cells. Our results suggest that F508del-CFTR correctors acting by altering the cell transcriptome may be particularly active in heterologous expression systems but markedly less effective in native epithelial cells.', 27151717: 'The development of immunohistochemical methods has outlined a particular group of tumors, with very specific features and treatment, originating in the Cajal cells of the muscularis propria or related stem cell-like precursors present in the wall of the digestive tract called gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). A sub-segment with similar features may develop outside the digestive tract, namely extra-gastrointestinal stromal tumors (EGISTs). From the small category of EGISTs, we report on a case of a primary epithelioid EGIST of the greater omentum, which is seldom reported in literature. The tumor was diagnosed in a man with non-specific symptoms who presented for abdominal enlargement. The tumor was characterized and there was a preoperative suspicion of a non-digestive tumor located in the greater omentum. The tumor was surgically removed showing no contact with adjacent organs. Immunohistochemical examination was consistent with a primary EGIST of the greater omentum. Treatment with Imatinib mesylate was started and at two-year follow-up, the patient is disease free. The case raises problems regarding pathogenesis, immunohistochemical features, behavior, evolution and prognosis of omental EGIST, for which no significant or conflicting data are available in the literature.', 21962088: 'To discuss recent issues pertinent to allergen immunotherapy practice in the United States. Allergen extract preparation guidelines, updated allergen immunotherapy practice parameter (AIPP) guidelines, and evolving trends in how immunotherapy outcomes will be measured and assessed. Allergen extract preparation guidelines have been established by 2 entities: the US Pharmacopeia and an American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology/American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology/Joint Council of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology Joint Task Force. Minor differences exist between these guidelines, but both focus on aseptic techniques and require that compounding personnel pass a written examination and annual media fill test. The AIPP third update provides new dosing recommendations for Bermuda grass, imported fire ant, and nonstandardized extracts distinguishing between pollen (0.5 mL of a 1:100 or 1:200 vol/vol) and mold/fungi or cockroach (highest tolerated dose) extracts. Because of limited and sometimes conflicting data on high and low proteolytic-containing extract compatibility, the AIPP continues to recommend against mixing these together. Although the AIPP does not specifically recommend a specific diluent, recent evidence suggests normal saline may not be as effective a stabilizer for extract dilutions as glycerin or human serum albumin. Currently, immunotherapy efficacy is determined with subjective assessments that rely on patient reporting, but this may change as health care reform evolves. It will likely become more important for US allergy/immunology practices to demonstrate immunotherapy comparative-effectiveness and report quality measures.

Exposure was defined as a concurrent hospital stay between a prevalent and an incident case. B. cepacia strains were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ribotyping and endonuclease subtyping. The 16S to 23S spacer regions of the bacterial ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes were amplified by PCR, and the product-size patterns used to type each B. cepacia isolate. Endonuclease digestion of the PCR products provided length polymorphisms for subtyping. There were 17 incident events during the period from 1988 to 1994, 16 of which involved a single ribotype. These 16 ribotypes could be divided into five subtypes by endonuclease mapping. Four patients grew B. cepacia from the blood, with the organism being the same strain as found in the lung in each case. Case controls were obtained to evaluate risk factors for B. cepacia acquisition. Concurrent hospitalization with a prevalent case significantly increased the risk of acquisition.

The physiological relevance of Notch1 signaling during subsequent stages of T cell differentiation has been more controversial. This is due in part to conflicting data from studies examining the overexpression or targeted deletion of Notch1 and to difficulties in distinguishing between the activities of multiple Notch family members and their ligands, which are expressed in the thymus. We employed a polyclonal antiserum against the extracellular domain of Notch1 to study surface expression during thymopoiesis. We found high levels of Notch1 on the cell surface only on double negative (DN) stage 2 through the immature single-positive stage of thymocyte development, before the double-positive (DP) stage. The Notch signaling pathway, as read out by Deltex1 expression levels, is highly active in DN thymocytes. When an active Notch1 transgene, Notch1IC, is exogenously introduced into thymocytes of recombinase-activating gene 2-deficient mice, it promotes proliferation and development to the DP stage following anti-CD3 treatment without apparently affecting the intensity of pre-TCR signaling. In addition, a stromal cell line expressing the Notch ligand, Delta-like-1, promotes the in vitro expansion of wild-type DN3 thymocytes in vitro. Consistent with other recent reports, these data suggest a role for Notch1 during the DN to DP stage of thymocyte maturation and suggest a cellular mechanism by which Notch1IC oncogenes could contribute to thymoma development and maintenance.', 16166267: 'Extracellular matrix expansion in the glomerular mesangium contributes to the development of glomerulosclerosis and chronic renal disease in arterial hypertension. Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs) are involved in this process. Conflicting data are reported on the effects of angiotensin II (Ang II) and the response to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on MMPs and TIMPs in early stages of hypertensive glomerular damage. We therefore investigated the effects of Ang II-dependent hypertension on MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 in isolated glomeruli of 8-week-old homozygous male rats overexpressing the mouse Ren2 gene [TGR(mRen2)27]. At this age, systolic blood pressure was already significantly elevated in Ren2 compared with Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (197 +/- 38 versus 125 +/- 16 mm Hg, p < 0.01). Ren2 exhibited renal damage as determined by increased urinary albumin excretion, focal glomerulosclerosis, mesangial matrix expansion, and alpha-smooth muscle actin deposition. Quantification of mRNA levels in isolated glomeruli by real-time polymerase chain reaction showed a significant increase of TGF-beta1, a 2.3- and a 2.6-fold increase of MMP-2 and TIMP-1 in Ren2 compared with SD (p < 0.01, respectively) and no strain differences for TIMP-2. In contrast, MMP-9 mRNA expression was markedly suppressed to 10% of control levels in Ren2 (p < 0.01). Early treatment with ramipril completely prevented renal damage in Ren2 and restored mRNA expression of TGF-beta1, MMP-2, and TIMP-1 to SD control levels. Interestingly, down-regulation of MMP-9 mRNA, protein, and activity was not affected by ramipril, indicating that the protective effect of this compound is not attributable to restoration of MMP-9 in the glomerulus.', 12390634: StringElement(\"We evaluated migraine as an independent risk factor for subsequent coronary heart disease (CHD) events among women in the Women's Health Study (WHS) and men in the Physicians' Health Study (PHS).\", attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'OBJECTIVE', u'Label': u'OBJECTIVE'}), 16551296: 'Many fundamental aspects of the management of renal replacement therapy (RRT) in acute renal failure (ARF) remain unresolved. While data from multiple studies support the initiation of RRT, in the absence of other indications, when the BUN has reached a level of approximately 90-100 mg/dl, there are conflicting data regarding the benefit of earlier initiation of renal support. The relative efficacy of the various RRT modalities is uncertain. Despite growing utilization, a survival benefit or greater recovery of renal function has not been demonstrated for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) as compared to conventional intermittent hemodialysis (IHD). Optimal dosing strategies are also poorly defined. While there is increasing evidence that more intensive renal support is associated with better outcomes in ARF, an optimal Kt/Vurea and treatment frequency for IHD remain to be established. Similarly, although data suggest that continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) should be dosed at no less than 35 ml/kg/hr (postdilution), confirmation of this dosing strategy and validation for other modalities of CRRT are required.', 6231429: \"Trilostane is known as an inhibitor of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Conflicting data published on this drug led us to look for the effects of 0.02 to 0.5 mM of trilostane on the in vitro steroid synthesis in sheep adrenals and human adrenals (Cushing's or Conn's syndrome) in the presence of an NADPH-generating system. The synthesis of 4-androstenedione, 11 beta-hydroxyandrostenedione and 11-ketoandrostenedione were studied either from dehydroepiandrosterone or 4-androstenedione or 11 beta-hydroxyandrostenedione. The synthesis of 11-deoxycortisol, cortisol, cortisone, 4-androstenedione, 11 beta-hydroxyandrostenedione and 11-ketoandrostenedione were studied either from 17-hydroxyprogesterone or 11-deoxycortisol or cortisol. This study showed that trilostane inhibited 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase whereas it had no effect on 21-, 11- and 17-hydroxylase. Trilostane was responsible for an increased 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity in vitro, resulting in low yields of cortisol and 11 beta-hydroxyandrostenedione, and high yields of cortisone and 11-ketoandrostenedione. This unexpected effect of trilostane allowed us to show that erroneous conclusions (in this case: pseudo inhibition of 11 beta-hydroxylase) can be drawn if all the metabolic pathways from a determined precursor are not exhaustively documented when studying the effects of drugs on steroid synthesis in vitro. The decrease of cortisol synthesis by trilostane may thus be related to the effects of the drug on both 3 beta-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase (inhibitory effect) and 11 beta-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase (stimulatory effect). This latter effect was found to be species-dependent.\", 17917319: 'Although the augmentation index (AIx) is widely used to evaluate arterial stiffness in clinics and research, some conflicting data exist in regard to its validity. We therefore performed a series of studies to test the validity of AIx. The first study in 196 peritoneal dialysis patients showed that AIx in diabetics was lower than that in non-diabetic patients (p<0.05), which was in contradiction with the previous studies. Further analysis showed that AIx was just weakly correlated with pulse pressure (PP)-a known index of arterial stiffness. We also found that the increase of augmentation pressure (AP) was usually accompanied with increased central PP (C-PP). As AP and C-PP are used as the numerator and denominator in the AIx formula, an increase in the numerator (AP) would not necessarily result in an increase of the quotient (AIx) unless the denominator (C-PP) was stable. We then conducted a second study trying to test the validity of AIx through mathematical ratiocination. The increases in the central second peak (P2) and AP were assumed to represent increased arterial stiffness. Different values of AIx were obtained by varying the central initial systolic peak (P1) and diastolic pressure (DP). Mathematical ratiocination showed that AIx was dependent on multiple factors, F=(DeltaSP-DeltaDP)x(P1-P2)+(DeltaP2-DeltaP1)x(SP-DP), which suggested that a change of AIx would not always be attributable to changes in P2 and AP. This speculation was further proved by clinical data in our third study. In conclusion, through a series of studies and ratiocination, we showed that the augmentation index (AIx or AIx@75bpm) might not be a sensitive surrogate for a change in central pressure waveforms, which is a manifestation of change in large artery function. The limitation of AIx as an index of arterial stiffness is rooted in its formula, which has a clear mathematical flaw.', 21468552: \"Gene polymorphisms and mutations in various types of cancer may predict clinical response to chemotherapy and related toxicity, since they may affect the metabolism of the drugs commonly used in combination chemotherapy treatments. However, conflicting data have been generated on this subject. To elucidate this issue, this review discusses the clinical applications of several genetic polymorphisms in colorectal cancer patients treated with the most common agents alone or in combination. UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)1A1 is a conjugating biotransformation enzyme that plays a role in maintaining the levels of endogenous compounds (e.g., bilirubin) and in handling exogenous compounds, including carcinogens. It has been demonstrated that the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism plays a predictive role in patients administered an irinotecan-containing regimen. Polymorphisms in XPD (Lys751Gln), a member of the nucleotide excision repair pathway, negatively affect response to therapy, with oxaliplatin/5FU reducing the survival of the patient. A similar reaction has also been observed in patients with the XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism, while patients with the GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphism have an improved response to oxaliplatin/5FU therapy. Treatment with biological compounds such as cetuximab, an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibody, has been shown to be effective only in colon cancer patients with wild-type K-Ras. Fc polymorphisms are associated with progression-free survival in patients treated with cetuximab. Another monoclonal antibody useful in the treatment of colon cancer is bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF); however, in some cases bevacizumab may cause deep vein thrombosis (DVP). In a related vein, our recent unpublished data show that the VEGF C936T polymorphism may increase the risk of DVP in cancer patients. In conclusion, this review indicates that certain polymorphisms increase the effectiveness of certain drugs, while others greatly enhance their toxicity. The study of the genetic 'habitus' therefore appears to be crucial for the development of tailored therapy for cancer patients.\", 24296842: StringElement('Published evidence on established and theorized effects of celiac disease on drug absorption and pharmacokinetics is reviewed.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'OBJECTIVE', u'Label': u'PURPOSE'}), 27235725: UnicodeElement(u'GH treatment (GHT) can lead to glucose metabolism impairment through decreased insulin sensitivity and impaired pancreatic \\u03b2-cell function, which are the two key components of the pathogenesis of diabetes.

We analyzed bone marrow biopsy specimens obtained from 59 patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Expression of VEGF and MVD was analyzed using standard immunohistochemical method (antibodies against VEGF and CD34, respectively) on B5-fixed and routinely processed paraffin-embedded bone marrow specimens. MVD was estimated by counting the number of microvessels in three \"hot spots\" at 400x magnification. VEGF immunoreactivity was estimated on the basis of intensity and percentage of positive plasma cells. VEGF was expressed in 47/59 (79.7%) specimens. There was no significant correlation between VEGF overexpression and age, clinical stage, the extent of osteolytic lesions, type of monoclonal protein, hemoglobin concentration, platelet count, serum concentration of creatinine, calcium, and albumins, the extent of bone marrow infiltration, histological grade, and proliferative activity index (measured with Ki-67 immunoreactivity).

The consequences of falls are well recognised, and there has been considerable work into identifying risk factors. Changes in visual components such as visual field, acuity, contrast sensitivity and stereopsis all have a part and the co-existence of other sensory impairments certainly increases the risk of falls. However there remain considerable gaps in our knowledge of the relationship between visual loss and falls, for example in patients with diabetic eye disease. Furthermore, there is also conflicting data as to the importance of different visual components. Various interventions, such as programmed inter-disciplinary involvement, have shown promise, however these need further confirmation of their efficacy and cost effectiveness. An added confounder may be that an intervention (eg, cataract extraction) paradoxically affects an individual's future activity level and behaviour, thereby increasing the risk of falling.

They encompass impulse control disorders, punding and dopamine dysregulation syndrome. A relationship with dopaminergic treatment is strongly suggested. Subthalamic stimulation improves motor complications and allows for drastic reductions in medication. This treatment might, therefore, be considered for patients with behavioural addictions, when attempts to reduce dopaminergic medication have failed. However, conflicting data have reported suppression, alleviation, worsening or new onset of behavioural addictions after subthalamic stimulation. Non-motor fluctuations are also a disabling feature of the disease. We prospectively investigated behaviour in a cohort of 63 patients with Parkinson's disease, before and 1 year after subthalamic stimulation using the Ardouin scale, with systematic evaluation of functioning in overall appetitive or apathetic modes, non-motor fluctuations, dopaminergic dysregulation syndrome, as well as behavioural addictions (including impulse control disorders and punding) and compulsive use of dopaminergic medication. Defined drug management included immediate postoperative discontinuation of dopamine agonists and reduction in levodopa. Motor and cognitive statuses were controlled (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, frontal score). After surgery, the OFF medication motor score improved (-45.2%), allowing for a 73% reduction in dopaminergic treatment, while overall cognitive evaluation was unchanged. Preoperative dopamine dysregulation syndrome had disappeared in 4/4, behavioural addictions in 17/17 and compulsive dopaminergic medication use in 9/9 patients. New onset of levodopa abuse occurred in one patient with surgical failure. Non-motor fluctuations were significantly reduced with improvements in off-dysphoria (P\\u2009\\u2264\\u20090.001) and reduction in on-euphoria (P\\u2009\\u2264\\u20090.001). There was an inversion in the number of patients functioning in an overall appetitive mode (29 before versus 2 after surgery, P\\u2009\\u2264\\u20090.0001) to an overall apathetic mode (3 before versus 13 after surgery, P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Two patients attempted suicide. Improvement in motor fluctuations is linked to the direct effect of stimulation on the sensory-motor subthalamic territory, while improvement in dyskinesias is mainly explained by an indirect effect related to the decrease in dopaminergic drugs. Our data suggest that non-motor fluctuations could similarly be directly alleviated through stimulation of the non-motor subthalamic territories, and hyperdopaminergic side effects might improve mainly due to the decrease in dopaminergic medication. We show an overall improvement in neuropsychiatric symptomatology and propose that disabling non-motor fluctuations, dopaminergic treatment abuse and drug-induced behavioural addictions in Parkinson's disease may be considered as new indications for subthalamic stimulation.\", 27727264: StringElement('Major depressive disorder (MDD) and osteoporosis are two common disorders with high morbidity and mortality rates.

While cigarette smoking is a well-established cause of COPD, a myriad of assessed genetic factors has given conflicting data. Since gene-environment interactions are thought to be implicated in aetiopathogenesis of COPD, we aimed to examine the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 9 C-1562T (rs3918242) functional variant and cigarette smoke in the pathogenesis of this disease. The distribution of the MMP9 C-1562T variant was analyzed in COPD patients and controls with normal pulmonary function from Serbia. Interaction between the C-1562T genetic variant and cigarette smoking was assessed using a case-control model. The response of the C-1562T promoter variant to cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) exposure was examined using a dual luciferase reporter assay. The frequency of T allele carriers was higher in the COPD group than in smoker controls (38.4% vs. 20%; OR\\xa0=\\xa02.7, P\\xa0=\\xa00.027). Interaction between the T allele and cigarette smoking was identified in COPD occurrence (OR\\xa0=\\xa04.38, P\\xa0=\\xa00.005) and severity (P\\xa0=\\xa00.001). A functional analysis of the C-1562T variant demonstrated a dose-dependent and allele-specific response (P\\xa0<\\xa00.01) to CSC. Significantly higher MMP9 promoter activity following CSC exposure was found for the promoter harboring the T allele compared to the promoter harboring the C allele (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05). Our study is the first to reveal an interaction between the MMP9-1562T allele and cigarette smoke in COPD, emphasising gene-environment interactions as a possible cause of lung damage in the pathogenesis of COPD.

This cis-configuration is crucial for bile acid biosynthesis and plays important roles in steroid metabolism. The biochemical properties of the enzyme have not been thoroughly studied and conflicting data have been reported, partially due to the lack of highly homogeneous protein. In the present study, we systematically determined the substrate specificity of homogeneous human recombinant AKR1D1 using C18, C19, C21, and C27 \\u0394(4)-ketosteroids and assessed the pH-rate dependence of the enzyme. Our results show that AKR1D1 proficiently reduced all the steroids tested at physiological pH, indicating AKR1D1 is the only enzyme necessary for all the 5\\u03b2-steroid metabolites present in humans. Substrate inhibition was observed with C18 to C21 steroids provided that the C11 position was unsubstituted. This structure activity relationship can be explained by the existence of a small alternative substrate binding pocket revealed by the AKR1D1 crystal structure. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs which are potent inhibitors of the related AKR1C enzymes do not inhibit AKR1D1. By contrast chenodeoxycholate and ursodeoxycholate were found to be potent non-competitive inhibitors suggesting that bile-acids may regulate their own synthesis at the level of AKR1D1 inhibition.', 20706731: StringElement('Caffeine is widely consumed, and its effect on intraocular pressure (IOP) has been reported in conflicting data.

Preclinical studies of intrathecal implantation with xenogeneic bovine chromaffin cells in rats have provided conflicting data with regard to analgesic effects, and recent concern over risk of prion transmission has precluded their use in human clinical trials. We previously developed a new, safer source of adult adrenal chromaffin cells of porcine origin and demonstrated an in vivo antinociceptive effect in the formalin test, a rodent model of tonic pain. The goal of the present study was to confirm porcine chromaffin cell analgesic effects at the molecular level by evaluating neural activity as reflected by spinal cord c-Fos protein expression. To this end, the expression of c-Fos in response to intraplantar formalin injection was evaluated in animals following intrathecal grafting of 10(6) porcine or bovine chromaffin cells. For the two species, adrenal chromaffin cells significantly reduced the tonic phases of the formalin response. Similarly, c-Fos-like immunoreactive neurons were markedly reduced in the dorsal horns of animals that had received injections of xenogeneic chromaffin cells. This reduction was observed in both the superficial (I-II) and deep (V-VI) lamina of the dorsal horn. The present study demonstrates that both xenogeneic porcine and bovine chromaffin cells transplanted into the spinal subarachnoid space of the rat can suppress formalin-evoked c-Fos expression equally, in parallel with suppression of nociceptive behaviors in the tonic phase of the test. These findings confirm previous reports that adrenal chromaffin cells may produce antinociception by inhibiting activation of nociceptive neurons in the spinal dorsal horn. Taken together these results support the concept that porcine chromaffin cells may offer an alternative xenogeneic cell source for transplants delivering pain-reducing neuroactive substances.', 9056840: 'The overall effects of oestrogen on the vasculature are beneficial as a result of its antioxidant properties and ability to enhance relaxation by modulating synthesis of endothelium-derived vasodilators and smooth-muscle cell Ca2+ signalling. Although the protective effects of oestrogen are well accepted, only limited and conflicting data are available on the cellular mechanisms mediating steroid action in the vasculature. Discrepancies in cell culture experiments may reflect differences in culture conditions, the origin of cells and/or hormonal status. For example, umbilical vein endothelial cells isolated from gestational diabetic pregnancies exhibit phenotypic changes that are maintained during prolonged cell culture [42,75]. As gender differences in vascular reactivity have long been reported [76-78], gender needs to be taken into account in interpreting vascular responses to oestrogen in animal models. Further research is required to characterize the non-genomic actions of oestrogen in the vasculature. Whether activation of non-genomic receptors by physiologically relevant plasma concentrations of oestrogen modulates the activity of endothelial cell NOS, cyclo-oxygenase and superoxide dismutase and smooth-muscle cell Ca2+ ion channel activity remains to be investigated. Prolonged exposure of the vasculature to circulating steroid hormones may more closely reflect in vivo conditions, since oestrogen is known to enhance endothelium-dependent relaxation in response to some agonists [79].', 16797107: 'The vasodilating peptide adrenomedullin has been reported to regulate vascular tone as well as proliferation and differentiation of various cell types in an autocrine/paracrine manner.

In this paper we investigate the effect of AM on proliferation of human aorta smooth muscle cell (HASMC). AM showed a potent dose-dependent inhibiting effect on angiotensin II (AngII) induced-proliferation and a stimulatory effect on proliferation of quiescent cells. The cAMP/PKA pathway was involved in the AM inhibitory effect of AngII-induced proliferation in HASMC. PI3K/Akt and ERK pathways were involved in the proliferative effect exerted by AM per se. Our results suggest that AM plays a role in the regulation of HASMC growth antagonizing the AngII effect and may be involved in conditions of altered regulation of the blood vessels.', 25894326: 'Metabolic acidosis is a common feature in chronic renal failure patients, worsening progressively as renal function declines.

However, no previous study investigated the relationship between pH, venous bicarbonate and anion gap with depression, sleep problems and cognitive function in HD patients. In this study we investigated these relationships. In total, 65 HD patients were included. The demographic parameters and laboratory parameters including bicarbonate, pH and anion gap was measured for all patients. Depressive symptoms, sleep quality and cognitive function, were measured by Beck depression inventory, The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and by Mini Mental State Examination, respectively. We found that, sleep quality but not cognitive function or depression was independently related with venous pH and bicarbonate. Anion gap has no independent relationship with sleep quality, cognitive function and depression.

To determine whether suppression of endogenous DHT alters gonadotropin secretion, we gave the selective 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor finasteride (5 mg daily), or placebo, to 20 healthy men for 28 days. Basal and GnRH-stimulated LH, bioactive LH, FSH, testosterone, and DHT levels were measured before and after 14 and 28 days of treatment. Basal DHT fell from 1.1 +/- 0.2 to 0.15 +/- 0.04 nmol/L after 28 days of finasteride treatment. A significant rise in baseline testosterone from 17.6 +/- 2.0 to 18.3 +/- 2.3 nmol/L was seen at 14 days (P = 0.046), but not at 28 days. No significant changes were seen in either basal or GnRH-stimulated gonadotropin levels on any day.

Metabolic disturbances are more common in PCOS women who are prone to develop metabolic syndrome and to present higher levels of some cardiovascular disease risk marker. Oral contraceptives are widely used in PCOS, but conflicting data have been reported regarding their impact on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism on PCOS women. This paper presents a critical evaluation of combined oral contraceptives (COCs) metabolic effect - carbohydrate metabolism and insulin sensitivity, lipid metabolism, haemostasis, body weight, arterial pressure and cardiovascular impact - on PCOS women. Because of the paucity of data on the impact of COCs on cardiovascular and metabolic parameters in PCOS patients, most of there commendations are based on studies involving ovulatory women. The use of low-dose COCs is preferable in PCOS, especially among patients with glucose intolerance, insulin resistance and uncomplicated diabetes mellitus. Although reported as a side effect of COCs, marked weight gain has not been confirmed among users. However, when arterial hypertension or elevated risk for thromboembolism is present, progestogen-only hormonal contraceptives should be used instead of COCs. Regarding dyslipidaemia, COCs reduce low-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol and elevate high-density lipoprotein and triglycerides, and therefore are not recommended for women with high triglycerides levels. The choice of a COC, which alleviates the PCOS-induced hyperandrogenism without significant negative impact on cardiovascular risk, is one of the greatest challenges faced by gynaecologists nowadays.', 18625986: 'About 90% of our time is spent indoors where we are exposed to chemical and biological contaminants and possibly to carcinogens.

To detect viral DNA replication, a highly sensitive assay was designed based on real-time PCR and SYBR green chemistry. Our results indicate that a bacmid in which the dnapol ORF was deleted is unable to replicate its DNA when transfected into Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf-9) cells, although when the dnapol ORF was introduced into the polyhedrin (polh) locus, this repaired virus could propagate at levels similar to the control virus.

Recent evidence suggests that altered sphingolipid signaling through increased sphingosine kinase activity may be an important mediator of breast cancer drug resistance. Sphingosine kinase-1 (Sphk1) is a proposed key regulator of breast cancer tumorigenesis, proliferation and resistance. There is, however, conflicting data on the role of sphingosine kinase-2 (Sphk2) in cancer biology and resistance, with some suggesting that Sphk2 has an opposing role to that of Sphk1. Here, we studied the effects of the novel selective Sphk2 inhibitor, ABC294640 (3-(4-chlorophenyl)-adamantane-1-carboxylic acid (pyridin-4-ylmethyl) amide), on human breast cancer. ABC294640 blocked both viability and survival at low micromolar IC(50) concentrations in the endocrine therapy-resistant MDA-MB-231 and chemoresistant MCF-7TN-R cell systems. Treatment with the inhibitor significantly reduced proliferation, as seen in immunofluorescence staining of Ki-67 in vitro. Interestingly, pharmacological inhibition of Sphk2 induced apoptosis through the intrinsic programmed cell death pathway. Furthermore, ABC294640 also diminished NF-\\u0138B survival signaling, through decreased activation of the Ser536 phosphorylation site on the p65 subunit. Xenografts of MCF-7TN-R cells growing in immunocompromised mice were utilized to validate the therapeutic efficacy of the sphingosine kinase-2 inhibitor.

In this study we have characterised a human fibroblast cell line MSU-1.1 which shows a similar endogenous fibrillin-1 pulse chase profile to primary human dermal fibroblasts and produces microfibrils. Expression of a approximately 50 kDa N-terminal recombinant peptide in MSU-1.1 resulted in efficient secretion of this peptide into conditioned media, N-terminal sequence analysis of the purified peptide identified 2 protease cleavage sites and a presumed signal peptidase site.

Hopefully, this approach could improve the predictability of the clinical outcomes of NO manipulation.', 3384802: 'The ability of Rhizobium leguminosarum 248 to attach to developing Pisum sativum root hairs was investigated during various phases of bacterial growth in yeast extract-mannitol medium. Direct cell counting revealed that growth of the rhizobia transiently stopped three successive times during batch culture in yeast extract-mannitol medium. These interruptions of growth, as well as the simultaneous autoagglutination of the bacteria, appeared to be caused by manganese limitation. Rhizobia harvested during the transient phases of growth inhibition appeared to have a better attachment ability than did exponentially growing rhizobia. The attachment characteristics of these manganese-limited rhizobia were compared with those of carbon-limited rhizobia (G. Smit, J. W. Kijne, and B. J. J. Lugtenberg, J. Bacteriol. 168:821-827, 1986, and J. Bacteriol. 169:4294-4301, 1987). In contrast to the attachment of carbon-limited cells, accumulation of manganese-limited rhizobia (cap formation) was already in full progress after 10 min of incubation; significantly delayed by 3-O-methyl-D-glucose, a pea lectin haptenic monosaccharide; partially resistant to sodium chloride; and partially resistant to pretreatment of the bacteria with cellulase. Binding of single bacteria to the root hair tips was not inhibited by 3-O-methyl-D-glucose. Whereas attachment of single R. leguminosarum cells to the surface of pea root hair tips seemed to be similar for both carbon- and manganese-limited cells, the subsequent accumulation of manganese-limited rhizobia at the root hair tips is apparently accelerated by pea lectin molecules. Moreover, spot inoculation tests with rhizobia grown under various culture conditions indicated that differences in attachment between manganese- and carbon-limited R. leguminosarum cells are correlated with a significant difference in infectivity in that manganese-limited rhizobia, in contrast to carbon-limited rhizobia, are infective. This growth-medium-dependent behavior offers and explanation for the seemingly conflicting data on the involvement of host plant lectins in attachment of rhizobia to root hairs of leguminous plants. Sym plasmid-borne genes do not play a role in manganese-limitation-induced attachment of R. leguminosarum.', 11372005: StringElement('Magnesium has been shown to be helpful in the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma.

The contribution of fat and carbohydrates to energy expenditure during exercise is modulated by several factors, including intensity and duration of exercise, age, training and diet, but also gender. Because sex hormone levels change throughout a woman's lifetime (in connection with puberty, the menstrual cycle, use of oral contraceptives and menopause), the female population has to be considered specifically in terms of substrate utilization, and metabolic and hormonal responses to exercise. Before puberty, there is no difference between males and females when it comes to substrate oxidation during exercise. This is not the case during adulthood, since women are known to rely more on fat than men for the same relative intensity of exercise. Among adult women, the menstrual cycle and use of oral contraceptives may influence substrate oxidation. While some authors have noted that the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle is connected with greater lipid oxidation, compared with the follicular stage, other authors have found no difference. Among oral contraceptive users, fat oxidation is sometimes increased during prolonged exercise with a concomitant rise in lipolytic hormones, as well as growth hormone. If this result is not always observed, the type of oral contraceptive (monophasic vs triphasic) and hormone doses may be implicated. Menopause represents a hormonal transition in a woman's life, leading to a decline in ovarian hormone production. A decrease in fat oxidation is consequently observed, and some studies have demonstrated a similar respiratory exchange ratio during prolonged exercise in postmenopausal women and in men. As is the case during puberty, no sex difference should thus appear after menopause in the absence of hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). Results concerning women who take HRT remain conflicting. HRT may act on fat loss by increasing lipid metabolism, but this depends on how the treatment is administered (orally vs transdermally). To better understand the role of ovarian hormones in substrate oxidation, studies have made use of animal protocols to investigate cellular mechanisms. Estradiol and progesterone seem to have opposite effects, with greater lipid oxidation when estradiol is used alone. However, the concentrations used (physiological levels or pharmacological doses) may considerably modify fuel selection. In cases where conflicting data are observed in studies of substrate utilization and prolonged exercise in women, methodological reasons must be called into question. Too many parameters, which oftentimes are not specified, may modulate substrate utilization and metabolic and hormonal responses to prolonged exercise. Although information is generally provided about the type of exercise, its duration and the subjects' training level, detailed information is not always given about the subjects' nutritional state and, more specifically, the hormonal status of female subjects. The primary purpose of this review was to identify the impact of hormonal status on substrate oxidation among female subjects at rest and during exercise. A second aim was to describe gender differences in substrate utilization during exercise.\", 19394024: 'Proteoglycans (PG) and their associated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chains are known to play a key role in the bearing of compressive loads in cartilage and other skeletal connective tissues. In tendons and connective tissues that are primarily loaded in tension, the influence of proteoglycans on mechanical behavior is debated due to conflicting experimental evidence that alternately supports or controverts a functional role of proteoglycans in bearing tensile load. In this study we sought to better reconcile these conflicting data by investigating the possibility that GAG content is differentially related to tensile tendon mechanics depending upon the anatomical subregion one considers. To test this hypothesis, we quantified the mechanical consequences of proteoglycan disruption within specific tendon anatomical subregions using an optical-mechanical measurement approach. Achilles tendons from adult mice were treated with chondroitinase ABC to obtain two groups consisting of native tendons and GAG-depleted tendons. All the tendons were mechanically tested and imaged with high-resolution digital video in order to optically quantify tendon strains. Tendon surface strains were locally analyzed in three main subregions: the central midsubstance, and the proximal and distal midsubstance near the muscle and bone insertions, respectively. Upon GAG digestion, the tendon midsubstance softened appreciably near the bone insertion, while elastic modulus in the central and proximal thirds was unchanged. Thus the contribution of PGs to tensile tendon mechanics is not straightforward and points to a heterogeneous and complex structure-function relationship in tendon. This study further highlights the importance of performing local strain analysis with regard to tensile tendon mechanics.', 21076888: StringElement('There are conflicting data in the literature about the sensitivity of sestamibi scintigraphy in parathyroid tumour localisation in primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT).', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'BACKGROUND', u'Label': u'BACKGROUND'}), 16621037: 'Because of the conflicting data concerning the SARS-CoV inhibitory efficacy of ribavirin, an inosine monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase inhibitor, studies were done to evaluate the efficacy of ribavirin and other IMP dehydrogenase inhibitors (5-ethynyl-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylimidazole-4-carboxamide (EICAR), mizoribine, and mycophenolic acid) in preventing viral replication in the lungs of BALB/c mice, a replication model for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infections (Subbarao, K., McAuliffe, J., Vogel, L., Fahle, G., Fischer, S., Tatti, K., Packard, M., Shieh, W.J., Zaki, S., Murphy, B., 2004. Prior infection and passive transfer of neutralizing antibody prevent replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in the respiratory tract of mice. J. Virol. 78, 3572-3577). Ribavirin given at 75 mg/kg 4 h prior to virus exposure and then given twice daily for 3 days beginning at day 0 was found to increase virus lung titers and extend the length of time that virus could be detected in the lungs of mice. Other IMP dehydrogenase inhibitors administered near maximum tolerated doses using the same dosing regimen as for ribavirin were found to slightly enhance virus replication in the lungs. In addition, ribavirin treatment seemed also to promote the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines 4 days after cessation of treatment, although after 3 days of treatment ribavirin inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokine production in infected mice, significantly reducing the levels of the cytokines IL-1alpha, interleukin-5 (IL-5), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). These findings suggest that ribavirin may actually contribute to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV by prolonging and/or enhancing viral replication in the lungs. By not inhibiting viral replication in the lungs of infected mice, ribavirin treatment may have provided a continual source of stimulation for the inflammatory response thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of the infection. Our data do not support the use of ribavirin or other IMP dehydrogenase inhibitors for treating SARS infections in humans.', 7697902: 'One of the most serious side effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is upper gastrointestinal mucosal damage that may result in erosions, ulcerations and other serious complications. NSAIDs reduce endogenous prostaglandins, and this reduction is relevant to their pharmacology and toxicity. The stomach and to some extent the duodenum are the major organs involved in the mucosal toxicity of NSAIDs. With the availability of the synthetic prostaglandin misoprostol, it has become possible to prevent NSAID-induced gastroduodenal ulcers without compromising the beneficial antirheumatic and analgesic effects of NSAID therapy. In fact, misoprostol is the only drug with established long-term efficacy in preventing NSAID-induced gastroduodenal ulcers in rheumatic patients. The purpose of this communication is to critically review the efficacy of gastric antisecretory drugs, mucosal protective drugs and misoprostol when used for the prevention of NSAID-induced ulcers, considering only data from well-controlled, randomized, double-blind clinical studies. The histamine H2-receptor antagonist ranitidine has been shown to be effective in preventing NSAID-induced duodenal ulcers, but has no efficacy in preventing NSAID-induced gastric ulcers. In a direct comparative trial with ranitidine, misoprostol (200 micrograms qid) was significantly more effective than ranitidine (150 mg bid) in preventing gastric ulcers in chronic NSAID users. The inactivity of ranitidine in preventing gastric ulcers indicates that the pathogenesis of NSAID-induced gastric ulcers is not related to gastric acid. Limited but conflicting data exist with omeprazole. The mucosal-coating drug sucralfate has not been found effective in preventing NSAID ulcers. In fact, in a direct comparative trial, misoprostol (200 micrograms qid) was significantly more effective than sucralfate (1 g qid) in preventing gastric ulcers in patients receiving chronic NSAID therapy. No meaningful data exist with organic bismuth salts, a group of drugs which has mucosal coating and protective properties. From this brief overview, we conclude: (1) mucosal-coating compounds have no therapeutic role in preventing NSAID-induced ulceration; (2) gastric antisecretory drugs are not effective in preventing NSAID-induced gastric ulcers, and (3) misoprostol is the only antiulcer drug proven to be effective for preventing NSAID-induced gastric and duodenal ulcers in patients receiving chronic NSAID.

The available highly conflicting data are based on analysis of 175 ovarian carcinomas so far. As an attempt to further elucidate this issue, the first systematic study of HPV detection in ovarian cancer was carried out using a highly sensitive general primer PCR (confirmed by hybridization for low- and high-risk HPV types separately) in a series of 98 histologically and clinically well-characterized epithelial ovarian malignancies. Despite the high (fg) sensitivity and a wide HPV type coverage of the technique used, all 98 ovarian carcinomas failed to demonstrate any signs of HPV DNA whatsoever. The preexisting 12 reports comprising a total of 175 ovarian tumors analyzed for HPV were summarized, giving highly discrepant results (i.e., detection rates from 0 to 100%) with the overall HPV DNA detection rate of 25.7%. The reasons for these discrepant findings are most probably technical. Our data are consistent with those of the majority of the most recent reports failing to disclose HPV DNA in ovarian neoplasia.

In recent years there has been a growing awareness of the central role played by the lungs in the onset and progression of RA. In particular interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a common pulmonary manifestation that may be related to the inflammatory process itself, infectious complications and to the treatments used. Management of patients with ILD/RA is still a challenge for clinicians, both synthetic [mainly methotrexate (MTX), leflunomide] and biologic immunosuppressors [mainly anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\\u03b1] have in fact been related to the onset or worsening of lung diseases with conflicting data. Here we report the case of a 61-year-old male patient with severely active early RA, previously treated with MTX, who developed subacute ILD, along with a review of ILD/RA topic. Tocilizumab (humanized monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-6 receptor) was introduced on the basis of its effectiveness in RA without concomitant MTX and the ability to overcome the profibrotic effects of interleukin (IL)-6. After 3 months of treatment the clinical condition of the patient strongly improved until it reached low disease activity. He no longer complained of cough and dyspnea and bilateral basal crackles were no more present. Considering its distinctive features, tocilizumab, in such a challenging clinical condition, appears to be a safe and effective therapy, thus it enables RA remission without deteriorating ILD, at 1-year follow up, as confirmed by ultrasonography of the affected joints and chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT).', 27116115: StringElement('Systematic review.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'METHODS', u'Label': u'STUDY DESIGN'}), 19187188: 'The development of recombinant FVIII (rFVIII) products, fuelled by the need for improved safety of treatment arising from the dramatic widespread blood-borne virus transmission in the 1970-1980s revolutionized the care of children with haemophilia A over the last two decades. The larger availability of perceived safer replacement therapy associated with the introduction of rFVIII products reassured the haemophilia community and there was a strong push in some Western countries to treat haemophilic children only with rFVIII. Moreover, this significantly contributed in the 1990s to the diffusion outside Northern Europe of prophylactic regimens implemented at an early age to prevent bleeding and the resultant joint damage (i.e. primary prophylaxis), together with the possibility of home treatment. These changes led to a substantial improvement of the quality of life of haemophilic children and of their families. The general agreement that primary prophylaxis represents the first-choice treatment for haemophilic children has been recently supported by two randomized controlled trials carried out with rFVIII products, providing evidence on the efficacy of early prophylaxis over on-demand treatment in preserving joint health in haemophilic children. However, the intensity and optimal modalities of implementation of prophylaxis in children, in particular with respect to the issue of the venous access, are still debated. A number of studies also supports the role of secondary prophylaxis in children, frequently used in countries in which primary prophylaxis was introduced more recently. With viral safety now less than an issue and with the more widespread use of prophylaxis able to prevent arthropathy, the most challenging complication of replacement therapy for children with haemophilia remains the risk of inhibitor development. Despite conflicting data, there is no evidence that the type of FVIII concentrate significantly influences the complex multifactorial process leading to anti-FVIII alloantibodies, whereas other treatment-related factors are likely to increase (early intensive treatments due to surgery or severe bleeds) or reduce (prophylaxis) the risk. Although the optimal regimen is still uncertain, eradication of anti-FVIII antibodies by immune tolerance induction (ITI), usually with the same product administered at inhibitor detection, should be the first-choice treatment for all patients with recent onset inhibitors. This issue applies particularly to children, as most patients undergo ITI at an early age, when inhibitors usually appear. The availability of a stable and long-lasting venous access represents a leading problem also in this setting. These and other topics concerning rFVIII treatment of haemophilic children were discussed in a meeting held in Rome on 27 February 2008 and are summarized in this report.', 9610741: 'Studies on the role of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in bone metabolism have been accumulating. However, its effects on osteoblasts are still unclear because the results are conflicting depending on the study models employed. We reasoned that these conflicting data are due to variable expression levels of membrane-bound IL-6 receptors (IL-6Rs). In the present study, we found that IL-6 in combination with soluble IL-6R (sIL-6R) consistently caused a marked elevation of alkaline phosphatase and a decrease in proliferation in the human osteoblastic cell line MG-63, which expressed no detectable membrane-bound IL-6R and failed to respond to IL-6. These effects of IL-6/sIL-6R were blocked by neutralizing antibodies to the IL-6 signal transducer gp130, suggesting an involvement of IL-6 signaling in the elicitation of the effects of IL-6/sIL-6R. Upon stimulation with IL-6/sIL-6R, the gp130, cytoplasmic Janus kinases JAK1 and JAK2 were tyrosine phosphorylated. Moreover, signal transducers and activators of transcription STAT1 and STAT3 were also tyrosine phosphorylated, translocated to the nucleus, and bound to the putative STAT-binding DNA elements. In addition, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase was also activated in response to IL-6/sIL-6R These data demonstrate that sIL-6R may enhance the responsiveness of MG-63 cells to IL-6. Thus, IL-6 in collaboration with sIL-6R may modulate differentiation and proliferation of osteoblastic cells, presumably by activating two distinct signaling pathways of JAK-STAT and MAP kinase.', 15912438: StringElement('Treatment objectives in inflammatory dilated cardiomyopathy (DCMi), myocarditis (M) and peri(myo)carditis are 1) the elimination of inflammatory cells from the myocardium and pericardium, 2) the elimination or (second best) mitigation of B-cell products such as antibodies and immuncomplexes directed against cardiac epitopes such as sarcolemmal, fibrillary and mitochondrial epitopes, and 3) the eradication of the causative viral or microbial agent, if present.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'OBJECTIVE', u'Label': u'OBJECTIVES'}), 6151673: 'A brief review of the literature on the adverse reaction of lithium therapy in man is presented.

Cells were exposed to 20 MeV/ nucleon nitrogen ions, 968 MeV/nucleon iron ions, or 575 MeV/nucleon iron ions followed by transfer of the conditioned medium from the irradiated cells to unirradiated test cells. The effects studied included DNA double-strand break induction, gamma-H2AX focus formation, induction of chromatid breaks in prematurely condensed chromosomes, and micronucleus formation using DNA repair-proficient and -deficient hamster and human cell lines (xrs6, V79, SW48, MO59K and MO59J). Cell survival was also measured in SW48 bystander cells using X rays. Although it was occasionally possible to detect an increase in chromatid break levels using nitrogen ions and to see a higher number of gamma-H2AX foci using nitrogen and iron ions in xrs6 bystander cells in single experiments, the results were not reproducible. After we pooled all the data, we could not verify a significant bystander effect for any of these end points. Also, we did not detect a significant bystander effect for DSB induction or micronucleus formation in these cell lines or for clonogenic survival in SW48 cells. The data suggest that DNA damage and cytogenetic changes are not induced in bystander cells. In contrast, data in the literature show pronounced bystander effects in a variety of cell lines, including clonogenic survival in SW48 cells and induction of chromatid breaks and micronuclei in hamster cells. To reconcile these conflicting data, it is possible that the epigenetic status of the specific cell line or the precise culture conditions and medium supplements, such as serum, may be critical for inducing bystander effects.', 15035899: 'Phytoestrogens are plant constituents that possess either estrogenic or antiestrogenic activity.

Meta-analysis of five randomised clinical trials (n = 33,040) showed that, although intensive versus standard glycaemic control significantly reduced CV events in people with T2D, the reduction was less than that achieved with lipid-lowering or antihypertensive treatment. Furthermore, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentrations were a modest predictor for CV risk in people without T2D. Thus, although effective glycaemic control is important for the prevention/management of T2D, other risk factors must be addressed to effectively reduce CV risk. Reducing low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels using statins significantly reduces CV risk in people with and without T2D. Although statins are generally safe and well tolerated, conflicting data exist regarding the diabetogenic effects of some statins. Based on recent clinical trial data, the US Food and Drug Administration have changed the labelling of all statins to include 'an effect of statins on incident diabetes and increases in haemoglobin A1c and/or FPG'. However, the literature suggests that the beneficial effects of most statins on CV risk continue to outweigh their diabetogenic risks and that statins should remain as first-line therapy for the majority of people with dyslipidaemia and metabolic syndrome or T2D. Mechanisms explaining the potentially higher incidence of T2D with statin therapy have not been confirmed. However, independent predictors for statin-associated T2D appear to include elevated levels of baseline FPG, BMI, blood pressure and fasting triglycerides. Moreover, although some statins (for example, atorvastatin) are associated with increased haemoglobin A1c levels in patients receiving intensive but not moderate therapy, other statins (for example, pitavastatin) have demonstrated neutral or favourable effects on glucose control in patients with and without T2D or metabolic syndrome. The potential diabetogenic effects of statins may therefore differ between drugs. In conclusion, conflicting data exist regarding the diabetogenic effects of statins. Further studies are required to understand whether all statins have the same effect and whether some patient groups are at higher risk than others. Meanwhile, results suggest that the net CV benefit favours the use of statin therapy in patients with dyslipidaemia, irrespective of T2D risk.\", 29105668: 'Late onset hypogonadism (LOH) is the most commonly used term to indicate the age-dependent reduction of testosterone. Sexual dysfunction represents the most important determinant for medical consultation and the most specific symptoms associated with LOH. In particular, data from the European Male Ageing Study (EMAS), a population-based survey on more than 3400 subjects, recognized that a triad of sexual symptoms (low libido and reduced spontaneous and sex-related erections) is the only syndromic association with decreased testosterone levels. Accordingly, a meta-analysis of the available randomized controlled trials documented that testosterone therapy (TTh) is able to improve all aspects of sexual function when compared to placebo. Despite this evidence, however, the relative clinical significance and the potential benefit of TTh in LOH are still the subject of strong criticisms in the scientific community. The debate is further complicated by the recent position statement of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emphasizing a possible increased cardiovascular risk of TTh.

The functional consequences of this on the inflammatory response are not clear, with conflicting data published. In the clinic, exhaled NO (ex-NO) is used as a noninvasive biomarker to assess the extent of airway inflammation. It is proposed that monitoring levels of ex-NO could be a useful guide to determining the effectiveness of disease modifying therapies. The aim was, using pharmacological tools, to determine the role of NO in an aerosolized LPS-driven animal model of airway inflammation by assessment of ex-NO, neutrophilia, and inflammatory biomarkers, using a nonselective NOS inhibitor, N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME), and a selective inducible NOS (iNOS) inhibitor, N-3 (aminomethyl)benzyl)acetamidine (1400W). Real-time mRNA analysis of the lung tissue indicated an increased gene expression of iNOS following LPS challenge with minimal impact on constitutive NOS isoforms. LPS induced an increase in ex-NO, which appeared to correlate with the increase in iNOS gene expression and airway neutrophilia. Treatment with l-NAME and 1400W resulted in comparable reductions in ex-NO, a reduction in airway neutrophilia, but had little impact on a range of inflammatory biomarkers. This study indicates that the LPS-induced rise in ex-NO is due to enhanced iNOS activity and that NO has a role in airway neutrophilia. Additionally, it appears using ex-NO as a guide to monitoring airway inflammation may have some use, but data should be interpreted with caution when assessing therapies that may directly impact on NO formation.', 20413698: 'Obesity has become an epidemic in the United States and is reaching epidemic levels in many other countries.

The most severe post-radiation injury of the mandible is osteoradionecrosis (ORN). Conflicting data have been reported on the incidence of this complication, its aetiology and management. The incidence of mandibular ORN in head and neck cancer patients managed with radical or postoperative irradiation, has varied widely in the literature from 0.4% to 56%. The interpretation of data derived from particular series are difficult due to the different scoring methods and classification systems used for the evaluation of post-radiation bone damage. Although ORN occurs typically in the first three years after radiotherapy, patients probably remain at indefinite risk. The diagnosis of ORN is principally based on the clinical picture of chronically exposed bone. Radiological symptoms include decreased bone density with fractures, cortical destruction and loss of spongiosa trabeculation. Numerous factors that may be associated with the risk of ORN include treatment-related variables (for example, total radiotherapy dose, biologically effective dose, photon energy, brachytherapy dose rate, combination of external beam irradiation and interstitial brachytherapy, field size, fraction size, volume of the mandible irradiated with a high dose), patient-related variables (like deep parodontitis, pre-irradiation bone surgery, bad oral hygiene, alcohol and tobacco abuse, bone inflammation, dental extraction after radiotherapy) and tumour-related factors (tumour size or stage, proximity of the tumour to bone, anatomic tumour site). Primary management of post-radiation bone lesions include conservative modalities such as saline irrigations, antibiotics during infectious episodes, topically applied antiseptics, gentle sequestrectomy and removal of visibly loosened bone elements as well as treatment with hyperbaric oxygen (HBO). Surgery is reserved for persistent ORN and includes radical resection of the lesion(sequestrectomy, hemimandibulectomy etc.) with reconstruction. In recent years the introduction of preventive oral hygiene measures and meticulous dental evaluations before and after irradiation, improvement in radiotherapy techniques and the development of reliable diagnostic and therapeutic procedures have resulted in a decreased incidence of ORN. Nevertheless, given the severe impact of ORN on patient quality of life, research should be continued to further ameliorate this problem.', 10194457: \"The notion that the pathology of Chagas' disease has an autoimmune component was initially based on the finding of circulating antibodies binding heart tissue antigens in patients and mice chronically infected with Trypanosoma cruzi. Later, T lymphocytes reactive with heart or nerve tissue antigens were found in chagasic mice and patients, extending the concept to include cell-mediated immunity. However, there is disagreement about whether the observed immunologic autoreactivities are triggered by T. cruzi epitopes and then affect host tissue antigens by virtue of molecular mimicry or are elicited by host antigens exposed to lymphocytes after tissue damage caused by the parasite. There is also disagreement about the relevance of immunologic autoreactivities to the pathogenesis of Chagas' disease because of the lack of reproducibility of some key reports supporting the autoimmunity hypothesis, conflicting data from independent laboratories, conclusions invalidated by advances in our understanding of the immunologic mechanisms underlying cell lysis, and, last but not least, a lack of direct, incontrovertible evidence that cross-reacting antibodies or autoreactive cells mediate the typical pathologic changes associated with human Chagas' disease.

Evidence would support that a subset of this disease is caused by H. pylori-induced gastritis. Despite the conflicting evidence, most studies evaluating H. pylori clearance and eradication, particularly the long-term studies, have observed clinical improvement in most subjects. Hill's concepts to distinguish causal from noncausal associations of an agent to a specific disease include the strength of association, consistency, specificity, temporality, biologic gradient, plausibility, coherence, experimental evidence, and analogy. There is considerable criticism of these nine aspects of epidemiologic evidence to judge whether an association is causal. These epidemiologic criteria to support that an association is causal are inappropriate when applied to H. pylori and NUD. First, the disease definition, based on clinical criteria, is imprecise, with poorly defined end points and considerable individual variability in interpretation. Second, it would appear that the cause is multifactorial, and thus, evaluation of one etiologic agent is inappropriate. In view of the potential factors to cause NUD, a scheme of treatment with a subset of eradication of H. pylori if present is advocated (Fig. 1). It is suggested that, because of the conflicting data in this area, subjects be entered into clinical trials, with eradication of H. pylori evaluated and long-term follow-up of symptoms accurately monitored.\", 6834635: 'Because of the conflicting results of eight major controlled trials, BCG vaccination against tuberculosis remains controversial despite more than 50 years of use. Suspecting a methodological source for the controversy, we reviewed the scientific and statistical quality of each trial. The analysis showed that (1) although biased allocation of the vaccine appeared an unlikely explanation for the disparate results, adequate demonstration of unbiased detection of tuberculosis was available only for the three trials reporting 75% or greater protective efficacy; and (2) in most trials reporting low efficacy, the results had wide confidence intervals that could not exclude high efficacy, but the trials reporting high efficacy all had narrow confidence intervals that excluded low efficacy. Because the trials with the best methodological quality and greatest statistical precision reported high efficacy, the evidence suggests that BCG can confer a high degree of protection against tuberculosis and that bias or inadequate statistical power may have contributed to the conflicting data.', 27197833: u'A fixed gene copy number is important for the in silico construction of engineered synthetic networks. However, the copy number of integrated genes depends on their genomic location. This gene dosage effect is rarely addressed in synthetic biology. Two studies in Escherichia coli presented conflicting data on the impact of gene dosage. Here, we investigate how genome location and gene orientation influences expression in Bacillus subtilis. An important difference with the E.\\xa0coli studies is that we used an unbiased genome integration approach mediated by random transposon insertion. We found that there is a strong gene dosage effect in fast growing B.\\xa0subtilis cells, which can amount to a 5-fold difference in gene expression. In contrast, gene orientation with respect to DNA replication direction does not influence gene expression. Our study shows that gene dosage should be taken into account when designing synthetic circuits in B.\\xa0subtilis and presumably other bacteria.', 25017889: 'Over the past 15 years an immense amount of data has accumulated regarding the infiltration and activation of lymphocytes in the traumatized spinal cord. Although the impact of the intraspinal accumulation of lymphocytes is still unclear, modulation of the adaptive immune response via active and passive vaccination is being evaluated for its preclinical efficacy in improving the outcome for spinal-injured individuals. The complexity of the interaction between the nervous and the immune systems is highlighted in the contradictions that appear in response to these modulations. Current evidence regarding augmentation and inhibition of the adaptive immune response to spinal cord injury is reviewed with an aim toward reconciling conflicting data and providing consensus issues that may be exploited in future therapies. Opportunities such an approach may provide are highlighted as well as the obstacles that must be overcome before such approaches can be translated into clinical trials.', 21958178: u\"Beh\\xe7et's Disease (BD) is a multisystem inflammatory disorder of uncertain etiology with a variety of potential manifestations throughout the body, and its ocular complications are some of its most devastating. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents has improved outcomes, but many patients suffer from disease that responds poorly to conventional therapies. Because of this, therapy with a variety of biological response modifiers has been employed. The earliest was interferon-\\u03b1, and a multitude of reports have described its benefits for the uveitis associated with Beh\\xe7et's Disease. Many patients enjoy durable remissions of their ocular inflammatory disease even after discontinuation of therapy, but side-effects are almost universal and some can be dangerous. Of the newer biological response modifiers, infliximab, a monoclonal antibody to TNF-\\u03b1, has been most extensively studied. It is reported to be rapidly effective in many cases of Beh\\xe7et's Disease uveitis, though with conflicting data as to the ability to induce durable remission after cessation of treatment. Side-effects are relatively rare, but may be serious. Several reports have been published on the use of other biologic agents, including adalimumab (a humanized antibody to TNF-\\u03b1), etanercept (a molecule that resembles the TNF-\\u03b1 receptor), and rituximab (an antibody to CD20 that depletes the body of CD20-positive B cells). Of the three of these, adalimumab has the most promising initial evidence, etanercept has very few positive reports in patients with BD uveitis (and is likely ineffective in uveitis in general), and rituximab is lacking data. Although randomized controlled trials are almost completely lacking, currently available evidence is promising that biologic agents can prove an invaluable addition to the armamentarium of the practitioner treating patients with BD uveitis.\", 21605923: 'Chitosans, polysaccharides obtained from the exoskeleton of crustaceans, have been shown to exert antibacterial activity in vitro and their use as a food preservative is of growing interest. However, beyond a consensus that chitosan appears to disrupt the bacterial cell membrane, published data are inconsistent on the chemical characteristics that confer the antibacterial activity of chitosan. While most authors agree that the net charge density of the polymer (reflected in the fraction of positively charged amino groups at the C-2 position of the glucosamine unit) is an important factor in antibacterial activity, conflicting data have been reported on the effect of molecular weight and on the susceptibility among different bacterial species to chitosan. Therefore, we prepared batches of water-soluble hydrochloride salts of chitosans with weight average molecular weights (M(w)) of 2-224kDa and degree of acetylation of 0.16 and 0.48. Their antibacterial activity was evaluated using tube inhibition assays and membrane integrity assays (N-Phenyl-1-naphthylamine fluorescence and potassium release) against Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella Typhimurium and three lipopolysaccharide mutants of E. coli and S. Typhimurium. Chitosans with lower degree of acetylation (F(A)=0.16) were more active than the more acetylated chitosans (F(A)=0.48). No trends in antibacterial action related to increasing or decreasing M(w) were observed although one of the chitosans (M(w) 28.4kDa, F(A)=0.16) was more active than the other chitosans, inhibiting growth and permeabilizing the membrane of all the test strains included. The test strains varied in their susceptibility to the different chitosans with wild type S. Typhimurium more resistant than the wild type E. coli. Salmonellae lipopolysaccharide mutants were more susceptible than the matched wild type strain. Our results show that the chitosan preparation details are critically important in identifying the antibacterial features that target different test organisms.', 11304486: 'There are strong data favoring the pathogenic role of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT(1)) activation with subsequent promotion of myocyte growth and cardiac fibrosis in the development of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. An emerging hypothesis suggests that the activity of the angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT(2)) may counterregulate AT(1) receptor effects during cardiac development and during the evolution of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. In this review, we examine the potential role of AT(2) activity in the context of this hypothesis. In contrast to the counterregulatory hypothesis, studies in mice with an overabundance of, or a deficiency in, the AT(2) receptor do not suggest that AT(2) signaling is essential for cardiac development. Moreover, the proposed antigrowth effects of AT(2) receptor signaling in pathological cardiac hypertrophy could not be shown in two mice models both deficient in AT(2) receptors. The role of AT(2) receptor signaling in cardiac fibrosis is, however, still debatable because of conflicting data in the same two studies. In angiotensin II-evoked apoptosis in cardiomyocytes, the proposed proapoptotic role of AT(2) activity could not be confirmed. Furthermore, in the progression from the bench to bedside, the results of two large clinical trials in heart failure, namely ELITE II and Val-HeFT, can be explained without ascribing a major protective role to the unopposed activity of the AT(2) receptor in the failing myocardium. In this review, we conclude that the collective evidence does not strongly support a net beneficial effect of AT(2) stimulation in the diseased myocardium.', 26860124: StringElement('Vorapaxar, a novel platelet thrombin protease-activated receptor 1 blocker, is currently approved for post-myocardial infarction and peripheral artery disease indications on top of clopidogrel or/and aspirin.

The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of chronic GC replacement treatment in children with classical and non classical CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD) by quantitative ultrasonometry (QUS), an easy, cheap, and radiation-free technique. The study population consisted of nineteen 21-OHD patients (nine males) on lifelong GC treatment. Anthropometric, hormonal, and treatment data were recorded for each patient, and bone quality was assessed by QUS measurements. QUS findings (amplitude-dependent speed of sound and bone transmission time) were normal in 21-OHD patients and did not correlate with duration of treatment, daily, total, and yearly hydrocortisone dose. Furthermore, no significant correlation was found between QUS findings and 17\\u03b1-hydroxy progesterone, \\u03944-androstenedione, and\\xa0testosterone levels.

Failure to correct this prothrombotic state may be one of the possible reasons for the disappointing effect of antihypertensive treatment on the incidence of coronary events. In this regard, data from the literature indicate that different antihypertensive drugs may vary in their influence on fibrinolysis. Scarce and conflicting data exist regarding the effects of diuretics and beta-blockers on the fibrinolytic system. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (ACE-I) have generally been shown to improve the fibrinolytic balance by reducing plasma PAI-1 levels, calcium channel blockers (CCB) have been reported to increase t-PA activity, and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) seem to be neutral in their effect. Interesting data have been reported about the positive impact on fibrinolysis of combining an ACE-I with a CCB, which resulted in a decrease of PAI-1 caused by ACE inhibition, and an increase in t-PA resulting from calcium channel blockade. The positive effect of ACE-I on the fibrinolytic system has been related to: 1) inhibition of angiotensin II, which stimulates PAI-1 expression; 2) inhibition of degradation of bradykinin, a potent stimulus for tPA production; and 3) improvement of insulin sensitivity. The mechanisms underlying the CCB effect on t-PA are less clear, but a direct action of CCB on vascular endothelium has been reported to play a major role. The greater improvement in the fibrinolytic balance because of the combined action of ACE inhibition and Ca antagonism represents a further indication to the use of combinations of ACE-I and CCB in the treatment of hypertension.', 22681169: 'Impaired glucose tolerance is observed in depressed patients, and patients suffering from depression have an increased risk to develop diabetes mellitus. In depressed and diabetic patients, studies have shown both a beneficial effect of antidepressants on glucose homeostasis and the opposite. This review aims to structure the conflicting data and focuses on the question, which effect specific antidepressants have on glucose homeostasis. We therefore performed a systematic review of all available studies referenced in Medline from 1960 to 2011. We included antidepressant agents indexed in the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system of the WHO in 2011 and searched for studies investigating their effects on glucose metabolism in clinical samples as well as in healthy subjects. Of 876 studies screened we included 66. Most studies had small sample sizes and lacked a placebo group limiting conclusions about antidepressant effects on glucose tolerance. However, some evidence points to beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis of hydrazine-type monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). In case of SSRIs, the effect is more pronounced in diabetic patients or patients with comorbid depression and diabetes mellitus. Noradrenegic substances (and possibly also dualacting antidepressants), in contrast, may deteriorate glucose tolerance. They can be used in depressed patients when favorable effects on mood outweigh adverse metabolic effects, but in depressed diabetics this can be at the expense of worsening of glycemic control. The effects of other antidepressants, like bupropione, mirtazapine or newer agents, require further investigation before reliable conclusions can be made.

A small proportion of asthmatics develop a severe form of the disease and require a chronic long-term treatment with oral GC. These patients, ascribed as GC dependent asthmatics, present an ongoing inflammation of the airways. GC dependent asthma should be differentiated from GC resistant asthma. GC resistant asthmatics are defined as patients whose baseline pre-bronchodilation FEV1 of less than 70-80% predicted improves by less than 15% following 1-2 weeks of 40 mg prednisolone daily. The effects of GC are mediated by the GC receptor (GR) alpha. By a process called trans-activation they increase the transcription of genes involved in either beneficial processes or certain side effects. Through trans-repression, they inhibit the transcription factors, including nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B), thereby decreasing the expression of many genes encoding inflammatory mediators. In addition to GR alpha, an isoform deficient in hormone binding has been isolated in humans and termed GR beta, which functions as a dominant negative inhibitor of GR alpha. However, to act as such, GR beta has to be more abundant than GR alpha, and conflicting data have been obtained concerning the relative levels of the two isoforms in cell lines and freshly isolated cells. It seems however that overexpression of GR beta may play a role in GC-resistant asthmatics, whereas in GC-dependent asthmatics, a predominant GR alpha expression has been consistently found. Thus the persistence of inflammation in GC-dependent asthma does not seem to be associated with an overexpression of GR beta but with a dysfunction of the trans-repression or trans-activation processes mediating the anti-inflammatory effects of GR alpha.', 21789709: StringElement('A number of studies suggest a relationship between generalized joint laxity (GJL) and increased risk of some musculoskeletal injuries.

In breast cancer cells, several studies suggest that overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) leads to increased resistance against certain, but not all cytotoxic drugs. In ovarian carcinoma, conflicting data on the correlation of HER-2 expression and tumor cell sensitivity exist. In this paper, we explore the role of HER-2 expression and signaling levels pertaining to paclitaxel (Taxol) chemoresistance by applying three different and independent strategies in SKOV-3 ovarian carcinoma cells. Firstly, we show that treatment with the HER-2 inhibitory antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin), which is well established in tumor therapy, results in markedly increased, rather than decreased, cellular paclitaxel resistance. Next, we present two newly developed low molecular weight inhibitors of HER-2 tyrosine kinase activity, D-69491 and D-70166. With both drugs, the decrease in cellular paclitaxel sensitivity upon HER-2 inhibition is confirmed. Finally, for more detailed analysis we stably downregulate HER-2 expression by ribozyme-targeting. Using clonal ribozyme-transfected SKOV-3 cells with different residual HER-2 levels, we establish a 'HER-2 gene dose effect' of paclitaxel cytotoxicity. We show that this effect is due to differential induction of apoptosis and differential cell cycle inhibition by paclitaxel. Finally, paclitaxel- or HER-2-mediated alterations in the phosphorylation of MAP kinases p42/44, Stress-activated protein kinase/Jun-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK), and p38, and effects on the activation of caspase-3, caspase-7, and bcl-2 are discussed. We conclude that paclitaxel cytotoxicity in SKOV-3 cells is 'HER-2 dose-dependent' and identify cell proliferation as one underlying cellular event of this effect.\", 19656972: 'We have previously shown that skeletal muscle deiodinase type 2 (D2) mRNA (listed as Dio2 in MGI Database) is upregulated in an animal model of acute illness. However, human studies on the expression of muscle D2 during illness report conflicting data. Therefore, we evaluated the expression of skeletal muscle D2 and D2-regulating factors in two mouse models of illness that differ in timing and severity of illness: 1) turpentine-induced inflammation, and 2) Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. During turpentine-induced inflammation, D2 mRNA and activity increased compared to pair-fed controls, most prominently at day 1 and 2, whereas after S. pneumoniae infection D2 mRNA decreased. We evaluated the association of D2 expression with serum thyroid hormones, (de-)ubiquitinating enzymes ubiquitin-specific peptidase 33 and WD repeat and SOCS box-containing 1 (Wsb1), cytokine expression and activation of inflammatory pathways and cAMP pathway. During chronic inflammation the increased muscle D2 expression is associated with the activation of the cAMP pathway. The normalization of D2 5 days after turpentine injection coincides with increased Wsb1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha expression. Muscle interleukin-1beta (Il1b) expression correlated with decreased D2 mRNA expression after S. pneumoniae infection. In conclusion, muscle D2 expression is differentially regulated during illness, probably related to differences in the inflammatory response and type of pathology. D2 mRNA and activity increases in skeletal muscle during the acute phase of chronic inflammation compared to pair-fed controls probably due to activation of the cAMP pathway. In contrast, muscle D2 mRNA decreases 48 h after a severe bacterial infection, which is associated with local Il1b mRNA expression and might also be due to diminished food-intake.', 23929442: StringElement('There are conflicting data on the role of anxiety in predicting mortality.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'BACKGROUND', u'Label': u'BACKGROUND'}), 20170318: StringElement('Eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP) has been widely investigated in the clinical practice as a potential biomarker for asthma.

Results obtained from a variety of brain regions consistently indicate that cannabinoid agonists can also reduce glutamatergic synaptic transmission. However, there are still conflicting data concerning the role of CB1 in cannabinoid-induced inhibition of glutamatergic transmission in cortical areas. Here, we provide direct evidence that activation of CB1 on terminals of principal neurons controls excitatory synaptic responses in the forebrain. In slices of the basolateral amygdala, the CA1 region of the hippocampus, and the primary somatosensory cortex of wild-type mice, application of the CB1 agonist (R)-(+)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-(4-morpholinylmethyl)pyrrolo[1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazin-6-yl]-1-naphthalenylmethanone (WIN55,212-2; WIN) (5 mum) reduced evoked excitatory postsynaptic responses. In contrast, in slices obtained from conditional mouse mutants lacking CB1 in all principal forebrain neurons but not in GABAergic interneurons (CB1(f/f;CaMKIIalphaCre)), WIN no longer affected glutamatergic synaptic transmission in any of the brain regions tested. Compatible with a presynaptic mechanism, WIN did not change the sensitivity to focally uncaged l-glutamate. WIN reduced glutamatergic responses in slices obtained from mice lacking CB1 exclusively in GABAergic neurons (CB1(f/f;Dlx5/6-Cre)), thus excluding the involvement of CB1 expressed on GABAergic neurons in this effect of the drug.

We evaluated autonomic nervous system (ANS) function (heart rate variability (HRV), systolic blood pressure variability (SBPV) and baroreceptor gain (BRG)) and non-invasive haemodynamics (cardiac output and total peripheral resistance) in patients with neurocardiogenic syncope. Retrospectively, we evaluated 12 NCS patients (positive head-up tilt without pharmacological provocation) in the basal state and at initial tilt, 12 non-NCS patients with tilt-negative syncope and 12 aged-matched normal controls. Prospectively, we evaluated 16 NCS patients to analyse the haemodynamics and ANS activity throughout the tilt test (beginning of tilt and before syncope occurs). HRV and SBPV were accessed by fast Fourier transforms (FFT) and spontaneous BRG by temporal sequences, slope and a index. Modelflow was used to quantify the non-invasive haemodynamics. None of the autonomic and haemodynamic parameters at baseline or in the first 10 min of tilt was different among the respective NCS, non-NCS syncope and normal control groups, except for SBP, which was higher at baseline in controls. Throughout the tilt test in the prospective NCS group, the heart rate increased (88-95 beats x min(-1), P<0.05), systolic blood pressure decreased (123-109 mmHg, P<0.01), and arterial baroreceptor gain was reduced (7.6 to 5.5 ms mmHg(-1), P<0.01) and the absolute high frequency component of HRV (HF HRV) decreased (150-80 ms(-2), P<0.05), before syncope occurred. There was no change in the low frequency component of HRV (LF HRV), SBPV, cardiac output (CO) or total peripheral resistance (TPR). Tilt-induced syncope could not be predicted by non-invasive haemodynamic or autonomic parameters at rest or in the initial minutes of tilt.

Studies investigating the relationship between VDR genotypes and left ventricular hypertrophy revealed a highly significant association with the BsmI Bb heterozygous genotype. There are conflicting data on the action of vitamin D in left ventricular hypertrophy. Experimental as well as observational studies and small clinical trials have suggested that vitamin D administration may favorably influence left ventricular hypertrophy, whereas large randomized clinical trials have shown negative results. However, a beneficial effect on the left atrial volume index and the duration of hospitalization were observed in patients treated with vitamin D analogs. Larger clinical trials with robust clinical end points are needed to confirm that vitamin D is effective in preventing cardiovascular disease in chronic kidney disease patients and in general population.', 16866913: \"This communication integrates the purported role of cholesterol and statins in Alzheimer's disease (AD) with recent data. Meta-analysis of association studies relevant to AD indicates that apolipoprotein (apo)E4 is the only cholesterol-related polymorphism that shows clear association with AD. This suggests that the effect of apoE4 on the pathophysiology of AD occurs via a mechanism that is not directly related to cholesterol, such as fibrillization of Abeta. Despite the lack of genetic association, cholesterol and statins clearly modulate amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing in cell culture and animal models. Statins appear to act by a pleiotropic mechanism, involving both cholesterol (via lipid rafts) and isoprenylation. The pleiotropic mechanism of statin action clarifies conflicting data from clinical studies, where statins exert an action on Abeta and AD that might be dose dependent because of actions on both cholesterol and isoprenylation. Reduced isoprenylation can also inhibit inflammation. Our own studies of brains from Alzheimer subjects +/- statins indicate that statins inhibit inflammation in humans but might not reduce cerebral Abeta load. These results suggest that the primary action of statins in humans with AD might be to reduce inflammation rather than decrease Abeta load.\", 25962085: 'There is no debate any more on the good safety profile of postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) in healthy perimenopausal and early postmenopausal women, but there are still many open issues related to the consequences of long-term HT, especially in older women. A recent Cochrane meta-analysis showed that women who started HT less than 10 years after the menopause had lower mortality and coronary heart disease (CHD), but more venous thromboembolism (DVT). However, in those who started treatment more than 10 years after the menopause, there was high-quality evidence that it had little effect on death or CHD between HT and placebo groups but there was an increased risk of stroke and DVT. In contrast, many large, observational studies such as a recent one from Finland (3.3 million years of HT exposure) have shown that the risk of CHD or stroke death and all-cause mortality was significantly reduced, both in those who initiated HT below or above age 60 years. Because of conflicting data concerning long-term HT use, it seems that every health-care provider chooses as reference those studies that can support his/her individual views and therapeutic approach.', 21569126: u'Cardiovascular complications are the leading cause of death in renal transplant recipients and constitute one of the leading causes of graft failure. Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) induce an acceleration of atherosclerotic processes in the arterial wall. There are conflicting data whether cyclosporine A (CsA) and tacrolimus (Tac) differ in their deleterious effects on arterial stiffening. The present study combines several measurement techniques to provide a global and reliable assessment of the differential effects of CNI on the gold-standard parameters of arterial function. Pulse wave analysis was performed by the SphygmoCor (AtCor(\\xae) ), HEM-9000AI (Omron(\\xae) ), and CR-2000 device (Hypertension Diagnostics(\\xae) ) in 56 stable renal transplant recipients (29 CsA, 27 Tac). Groups were homogeneous for age, gender, body mass index, time on dialysis prior to transplantation, and graft function. Whereas systolic and diastolic blood pressure, central aortic blood pressure, cardiac index, large and small artery compliance index (C(1) and C(2) ), and pulse wave velocity did not significantly differ between CsA and Tac, augmentation index (AI(75) ) was significantly lower in patients treated with Tac. This finding was consistent as assessed by two different measurement systems (P\\u2003<\\u20030.05). Compared to CsA, Tac has a favorable impact on augmentation index, a strong independent predictor for cardiovascular mortality.', 1521937: 'There are conflicting data in the literature regarding target cells in 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD)-induced immunotoxicity. In the present study, adult male C57BL/6 mice were exposed to TCDD (50 micrograms/kg) 4 days prior to immunization with ovalbumin (OVA). The effect of TCDD on the specific immune response in vivo was determined by T-cell proliferation and IL-2 production in response to either OVA or anti-mouse-CD3 antibodies plus PMA in vitro. The antigen-specific T-cell proliferation and IL-2 production in response to OVA were significantly suppressed by TCDD, while the polyclonal response to anti-CD3 antibodies plus PMA was not affected. This indicates that even at a high dose of TCDD the intra T-cell signalling pathways in resting cells are not disturbed, but TCDD selectively impairs the antigen-specific activation of T-cells. Since activated T-cells are required in antibody responses to T-dependent antigens, the low number of such cells observed in the present study, may well explain the suppressive effects of TCDD on humoral immunity reported previously.', 17550953: StringElement('To identify and evaluate the data regarding medication use for migraine prophylaxis in the pediatric population.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'OBJECTIVE', u'Label': u'OBJECTIVE'}), 23277162: u'Two competing hypotheses are proposed to cause autoimmunity: evasion of a sporadic self-reactive clone from immune surveillance and ineffective suppression of autoreactive clones that arise physiologically.

As the rare controlled trials having tested these therapeutic strategies have provided conflicting data, this therapeutic attitude cannot be considered as a standard treatment. The tested protocols using combined radiochemotherapy were developed in the sixties and seventies and have been greatly improved since that time. New combinations for neoadjuvant and adjuvant radiochemotherapy protocols are currently under evaluation in controlled therapeutic trials. Systemic chemotherapy (gemcitabine, 5FU, platinum) has a palliative effect, improving the quality of life in patients with advanced-stage disease. Gemcitabine is easy to administer and has a low toxicity profile. It is widely used in standard protocols. Therapeutic trials combining gemcitabine and other cytotoxic agents are under way. Radiochemotherapy combinations using 5FU are a palliative alternative for patients with locally advanced disease, particularly those with painful symptoms. There is an urgent need for more effective treatments against metastatic disease and for better loco-regional management using a multidisciplinary approach. These patients should be treated within the framework of therapeutic trials.', 6784621: 'The use of high-dose isoniazid in retreatment regimens for tuberculosis, despite acquired isoniazid resistance, could possibly improve therapeutic results if all or part of the organisms were resistant to only low concentrations of that drug. Furthermore, organisms resistant to low concentrations of isoniazid have been shown, on occasion, to be resistant to 2 of the retreatment drugs, ethionamide and pyrazinamide, whereas higher degrees of isoniazid resistance are associated with susceptibility to these drugs. Use of high-dose isoniazid might improve results in retreatment with ethionamide and pyrazinamide by eliminating any organisms with low degrees of isoniazid resistance that have associated ethionamide and pyrazinamide resistance. Two clinical trials concerning this topic have been reported. A controlled retreatment trial with various combinations of ethionamide, cycloserine, and pyrazinamide with and without conventional \"low\" doses of isoniazid (300 mg per day) showed no benefit when isoniazid was added. However, a noncontrolled trial using ethionamide and pyrazinamide with and without high doses of isoniazid, 1 to 1.5 g per day, showed marked benefit with the added isoniazid. In view of these conflicting data, the use of high-dose isoniazid in retreatment regimens needs further study, which could probably be carried out in the developing countries.', 2315886: 'The influence of adult bovine serum (ABS) and fetal calf serum (FCS) on IgG anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) levels measured by ELISA has been investigated. In control subjects the frequency of the optical density (O.D.) distribution was found to be non-gaussian. The O.D. of the 97th percentile was similar with both buffers, although the distribution of O.D. was statistically different (P less than 0.004). The slope of the dilution curves of two house standards as well as the curves obtained with reference standards were found to be very different depending on the buffer. In 55 consecutive patients with thrombotic events, recurrent fetal loss or auto-immune disorders, ACA positivity was also dependent on the way to express the data and the choice of the buffer: when O.D. values were read with their respective standard curves, IgG ACA positivity was 98% with FCS and 20% with ABS (P less than 0.001), but when the 97th percentile O.D. was considered, 40% were positive with FCS and 51% with ABS (n.s.). Furthermore 10 patients were found to be negative with FCS and positive with ABS and 4 others showed the inverse picture. Levels of positivity were also dependent on the buffer. These differences arise from the solution used to dilute the sera and not of that to block the plates. These methodological problems may explain some conflicting data found in the literature about the prevalence of ACA positivity.', 15946660: StringElement('Conflicting data have been published concerning the effect of calcium on binding of autoantibodies to tissue transglutaminase (tTG) in celiac disease (CD).', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'BACKGROUND', u'Label': u'BACKGROUND'}), 26850932: 'Melanopsin, the photosensory pigment of specialized mammalian retinal ganglion cells, is involved in various non-image forming tasks such as pupillary light reflex, circadian entrainment and irradiance detection. Melanopsin genes have been detected in all vertebrate classes and are resolved in two lineages, Opn4m and Opn4x. In addition, two splice variants have been found in several species leading to a short (OPN4-S) and a long (OPN4-L) isoform, mainly differing in the length of the C terminus. Since its discovery in Xenopus laevis in 1998, this novel photopigment has received tremendous interest, but has been very refractory to the many attempts to unravel its photochemical and structural properties. Largely, some insight has been collected in its downstream signaling. Due to its low natural abundance most molecular data have been gathered via recombinant expression in heterologous hosts. A variety of expression hosts has been utilized, but to date only a restricted set of to some extent conflicting data has become available, which we here aim to put into perspective. We first briefly recall the most popular hosts and solubilization and purification approaches reported for GPCRs. Subsequently, a critical overview is presented of the outcome of the various host systems employed for recombinant expression of melanopsins, categorized by host type.

Testing protocols for the conduct of carcinogenicity studies in rodents have been developed in Guidelines promulgated by regulatory agencies, including the US EPA (Environmental Protection Agency), the US FDA (Food and Drug Administration), the OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) for the EU member states and the MAFF (Ministries of Agriculture, Forestries and Fisheries) and MHW (Ministry of Health and Welfare) in Japan. The basis of critical elements of the study design that lead to an accepted identification of the carcinogenic hazard of substances in food and beverages is the focus of this review. The approaches used by entities well-known for carcinogenicity testing and/or guideline development are discussed. Particular focus is placed on comparison of testing programs used by the US National Toxicology Program (NTP) and advocated in OECD guidelines to the testing programs of the European Ramazzini Foundation (ERF), an organization with numerous published carcinogenicity studies. This focus allows for a good comparison of differences in approaches to carcinogenicity testing and allows for a critical consideration of elements important to appropriate carcinogenicity study designs and practices. OECD protocols serve as good standard models for carcinogenicity testing protocol design. Additionally, the detailed design of any protocol should include attention to the rationale for inclusion of particular elements, including the impact of those elements on study interpretations. Appropriate interpretation of study results is dependent on rigorous evaluation of the study design and conduct, including differences from standard practices. Important considerations are differences in the strain of animal used, diet and housing practices, rigorousness of test procedures, dose selection, histopathology procedures, application of historical control data, statistical evaluations and whether statistical extrapolations are supported by, or are beyond the limits of, the data generated. Without due consideration, there can be result conflicting data interpretations and uncertainty about the relevance of a study's results to human risk. This paper discusses the critical elements of rodent (rat) carcinogenicity studies, particularly with respect to the study of food ingredients. It also highlights study practices and procedures that can detract from the appropriate evaluation of human relevance of results, indicating the importance of adherence to international consensus protocols, such as those detailed by OECD.\", 24043128: UnicodeElement(u'Despite established comparable efficacy between retropubic midurethral (RMUS) and transobturator slings, there are conflicting data regarding single-incision mini-slings (SIMS).

Cytokine-mediated inflammation might explain this association. Studies of cytokine profiles in patients with SCD have yielded conflicting data, but the possible influence of asthma status has not been examined. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that cytokine levels and profiles in SCD children reflected their asthma status. Samples from 155 Jamaican children (80 had SCD) and 64 British children (53 had SCD) who had their asthma status documented were analyzed for the presence and levels of interleukin 4 (IL-4) and interferon (IFN)-\\u03b3; they were also classified by their T helper cell (Th) cytokine profile. Jamaican children with SCD, when compared with Jamaican controls, were more likely to be diagnosed with asthma (P=0.001), more likely to be IL-4 positive (P<0.001), and more likely to be classified as having a Th-2 pattern (<0.001). In contrast, British children with SCD, when compared with the British controls, were less likely to have been diagnosed with asthma (P=0.04) and less likely to be classified as having a Th-2 pattern (P=0.006). Regression analysis demonstrated that amongst Jamaican children, SCD status, but not asthma status, ACS history, or gender, was predictive of IL-4 positivity and Th-2 status (P<0.001). In British children, none of those variables were significant predictors of IL-4 positivity or Th status. Cytokine profiles differed between Jamaican and British children. In the Jamaican children they reflected SCD, but not asthma or ACS status.', 10563178: 'Transmyocardial laser treatment is currently being evaluated as a treatment modality for patients with severe coronary artery disease unsuitable for conventional revascularization with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass grafting.

Results from clinical trials suggest that transmyocardial laser treatment leads to a significant decrease in physician-assessed angina scores and improvement of quality of life. There are, however, conflicting data regarding the effect of myocardial perfusion, and the mechanisms responsible for the observed clinical effect remain unclear. It has been suggested that the angina relief is caused by destruction of myocardial peripheral nerve-endings and improved perfusion through induction of angiogenesis and collateral recruitment.

This in part may be due to the use of a fixed correction factor when applying the adaptive motion-correction algorithm, which may potentially result in miscorrection of the imaging slice in subjects whose correction factor differs widely from the mean. We have addressed this issue by measuring the superior/inferior correction factor in 25 subjects and assessing the effect of using a subject-specific correction factor (CFss) for MRCA in comparison with no adaptive motion correction (CF0) and erroneous adaptive motion correction with a correction factor of 1.0 (CF1). There was a wide variation in the correction factor between subjects (proximal right coronary artery, 0.49 +/- 0.15, range 0.20-0.70; proximal left coronary artery, mean 0.59 +/- 0.15, range 0.20-0.85). The subject-specific correction factor was accurately calculated from motion of the aortic root in the coronal plane between expiratory and inspiratory breathhold (correction factor calculated from coronal image versus correction factor calculated after localization of coronary arteries, r = 0.92, p < 0.001). MRCA image quality was improved using a subject-specific correction factor, for both a 6-mm NE acceptance window (CFss versus CF0, p = 0.008; CFss versus CF1, p = 0.02) and a 16-mm NE window (CFss versus CF0, p = 0.01; CFss versus CF1, p = 0.007).

Thus, for adaptive motion correction to be implemented, a subject-specific correction factor should be used and calculated from simple coronal expiratory and inspiratory breathholds.

We present our experience with the MECT1/MAML2 translocation in a large cohort of MECs to address these issues. We analyzed 55 salivary MEC and 36 potential MEC mimics (24 Warthin tumors, 5 oncocytomas, 3 squamous cell carcinomas, 2 squamoid salivary duct carcinomas, 1 lymphoepithelial cyst, 1 Schneiderian carcinoma ex papilloma) for presence of the MECT1/MAML2 translocation by fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) and real-time RT-PCR. Overall, MECT1/MAML2 translocation was present in 36/55 (66%) of MEC whereas all 36 non-MEC were negative for translocation. Low or intermediate-grade MEC had a higher frequency of translocation (75%) than high-grade MEC (46%) (P=0.039).

Within high-grade MEC, MECT1/MAML2 positive tumors had lower rates of anaplasia (P=0.001), and mitotic counts (P=0.012). Thus, MECT1/MAML2 translocation is highly specific for MEC and imparts a better prognosis. However, it is frequent even within high-grade MEC and can be seen in lethal cases suggesting that translocation status should not supersede conventional parameters.

Significant differences were observed when we compared the cytotoxicity of mitomycin C and misonidazole as a function of oxygen concentration. For the drugs Adriamycin and bleomycin no differential effects of oxygen were noted for a 1-h drug exposure with hypoxia while some differences were noted only for bleomycin for an 8-h drug exposure time. Because differences dependent on oxygen concentration were observed for some drugs but not others at the same experimental conditions, and as indicated by a review of the literature, it is suggested that some of the conflicting data in the literature with respect to some of these drugs may be cell-line dependent. Other variables which may also be of importance were the duration of drug exposure time in hypoxia and cell density. The observed oxygen concentration-dependent changes in cell survival for the Ehrlich cells with drugs examined could not be explained on the basis of changes in drug-induced cellular oxygen consumption.\", 12043933: 'Topical treatment with capsaicin cream has been shown to be successful in the treatment of different symptomatic nerve disorders like diabetic neuropathy. Conflicting data exist on the effect of capsaicin on nerve function and neurovascular control especially in patients with diabetic neuropathy.

Capsaicin cream was applied to the feet of 13 patients with symptomatic diabetic neuropathy over a period of 8 weeks. Before and during the treatment period, we investigated the total symptoms score, the vibration, thermal (heat and cold) and pain perception thresholds, and the neurovascular responses to heat and acetylcholine stimuli. In addition, the serum plasma levels of substance P, a neurotransmitter of nociceptor C-fibres, were measured. A significant improvement in total symptoms score was observed during topical capsaicin treatment (18.3+/-3.2 vs. 14.3+/-3.3; p<0.05). An improvement in the heat perception threshold was also found (12.7+/-0.4 degrees C vs. 11.4+/-0.7 degrees C: p<0.05), while other sensory nerve fibre functions remained unchanged.

However, it is not unusual for conflicting data on the pain phenotypes of knockout mice to be generated by reputable groups. Here we focus on some technical aspects of measuring mouse pain behaviour that are often overlooked, which may help explain discrepancies in the pain literature. We examined touch perception using von Frey hairs and mechanical pain thresholds using the Randall-Selitto test. Thermal pain thresholds were measured using the Hargreaves apparatus and a thermal place preference test. Sodium channel Nav1.7 knockout mice show a mechanical deficit in the hairy skin, but not the paw, whilst shaving the abdominal hair abolished this phenotype. Nav1.7, Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 knockout mice show deficits in noxious mechanosensation in the tail, but not the paw. TRPA1 knockout mice, however, have a loss of noxious mechanosensation in the paw but not the tail. Studies of heat and cold sensitivity also show variability depending on the intensity of the stimulus. Deleting Nav1.7, Nav1.8 or Nav1.9 in Nav1.8-positive sensory neurons attenuates responses to slow noxious heat ramps, whilst responses to fast noxious heat ramps are only reduced when Nav1.7 is lost in large diameter sensory neurons. Deleting Nav1.7 from all sensory neurons attenuates responses to noxious cooling but not extreme cold. Finally, circadian rhythms dramatically influence behavioural outcome measures such as von Frey responses, which change by 80% over the day. These observations demonstrate that fully characterising the phenotype of a transgenic mouse strain requires a range of behavioural pain models. Failure to conduct behavioural tests at different anatomical locations, stimulus intensities, and at different points in the circadian cycle may lead to a pain behavioural phenotype being misinterpreted, or missed altogether.', 8205595: 'Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis is present in virtually all patients with duodenal ulcer (DU). Eradication of H pylori is associated with a highly significant decline in the recurrence rates of DU, indicating that treatments aimed at eradicating H pylori are mandatory in these patients. The novel proton pump inhibitor lansoprazole exhibits a potent antiulcer effect and, in vitro, a direct antibacterial effect against H pylori. Conflicting data have been reported on the question of whether lansoprazole is bactericidal against H pylori in vivo when administered alone. The aim of this double-blind trial was to address this issue further by comparing the effects of two different 4-week regimens (lansoprazole alone or in combination with amoxicillin) on H pylori infection in patients with DU. Patients were assessed before and after the 4-week treatment and 3 months after stopping the study medication. The ulcer healing rates at 4 weeks were similar for the two treatments while there was a trend for higher recurrence rates at 4 months in patients receiving lansoprazole alone. The frequency of high-grade H pylori infection was significantly lower in the lansoprazole and amoxicillin group both at 4 weeks (84% clearing) and 4 months. After 4 weeks of treatment there were no patients with residual H pylori-positive active antral gastritis in the lansoprazole and amoxicillin group compared with 25% in the lansoprazole alone group. Neither treatment significantly affected the IgG antibody response to H pylori either at the circulatory or the mucosal level. In contrast, the mucosal H pylori-specific IgA response was significantly enhanced after 4 weeks and more markedly after treatment with lansoprazole.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)', 20192932: 'Recent studies have introduced serum uric acid (UA) as a potential risk factor for developing diabetes, hypertension, stroke, and cardiovascular diseases. The value of elevated levels of UA in serum as a risk factor for diabetes development is still under scrutiny. Recent data suggest that clearance of UA is being reduced with increase in insulin resistance and UA as a marker of prediabetes period. However, conflicting data related to UA in serum of patients with Type 2 diabetes prompted us to study the urine/serum ratio of UA levels (USRUA) in these patients and healthy controls. All subjects included in the study were free of evidence of hepatitis B or C viral infection or active liver and kidney damage. Patients receiving drugs known to influence UA levels were also excluded from this study. Analysis of glucose and uric acid were performed on Dade Behring analyzer using standard IFCC protocols. Interestingly, our data demonstrated about 2.5 fold higher USRUA values in diabetic patients as compared to control subjects. Furthermore, there was a trend of correlation of USRUA value with the blood glucose levels in diabetic patients, which was more prominent in diabetic men than in women. With aging, levels of uric acid increased in serum of diabetic patients, and this effect was also more profound in male than in female diabetics. In conclusion, this study showed significantly elevated USRUA levels in patients with Type 2 diabetes, a negative USRUA correlation with the blood glucose levels in diabetic patients, and an effect of sex and age on the uric acid levels. Since literature data suggest a strong genetic effect on UA levels, it would be pertinent to perform further, possibly genetic studies, in order to clarify gender and ethnic differences in UA concentrations.', 26011302: StringElement('Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia.

High abundance of MSCs found in adipose tissue makes it a very attractive source of adult stem cells for further use in regenerative medicine applications. Despite immunomodulating properties of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) and a secretion of a wide variety of paracrine factors that facilitate tissue regeneration, effectiveness of stem cell therapy was not supported by the results of clinical trials.

The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between KSHV and myeloma in blacks in South Africa, in whom the disease is not uncommon and the seroprevalence of KSHV is higher than in the areas in which this association has been documented. Using a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, the authors initially tested for the presence of KSHV DNA sequences (KS330(233)) in bone marrow aspirates, bone marrow biopsy material, and cultured bone marrow adherent cell samples of patients with myeloma. KSHV DNA sequences were detected in 4 of 10 (40%) of the adherent cell cultures and 1 of 20 (5%) of the bone marrow aspirate samples. None of the bone marrow biopsy samples (0/9) or control bone marrow aspirate samples (0/19) was positive. To confirm the positive results in the bone marrow cultures noted above and to exclude contamination, the procedure was repeated in a further 7 patients with myeloma and 11 controls with lymphoproliferative disorders using the same nested PCR assay.

We sought to determine the characteristics of resting LV deformation in patients with neurocardiogenic syncope by selective motion tracking of subendocardial and subepicardial regions using speckle tracking echocardiography. We assessed resting LV function in 82 patients undergoing head-up tilt-table (HUTT) testing. Patients were divided into 3 groups based on a positive HUTT test with associated co-morbid conditions (n\\xa0= 30), no associated co-morbid conditions (n\\xa0= 30), or negative HUTT results (n\\xa0= 22). LV longitudinal, circumferential, and radial strains were obtained by speckle tracking echocardiography of subendocardial and subepicardial regions in each group and compared with resting LV deformation in 20 healthy control subjects. Compared with endocardial longitudinal strain in control subjects, that in patients with positive HUTT results was attenuated, irrespective of co-morbid conditions (p <0.05). Circumferential and radial strains did not differ among groups. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, endocardial longitudinal strain was an independent predictor (odds ratio, 1.16; p\\xa0= 0.01) of positive HUTT test results. In conclusion, resting LV longitudinal strain is attenuated in patients with positive HUTT test results. Overall, these results may suggest that an increase in resting LV contractility is not a prerequisite for development of neurocardiogenic syncope.', 16264880: \"The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, also known as statins, are commonly prescribed medications that lower serum cholesterol and decrease cardiac morbidity and mortality. These agents inhibit the rate-limiting step of the mevalonate pathway, an effect that influences cholesterol homeostasis and other diverse cellular functions. Preclinical data suggest statins have pleiotropic antineoplastic effects in a variety of tumors, but clinical studies have provided conflicting data regarding whether statins may increase or decrease the risk of cancer. Abnormal cholesterol metabolism in cancer is poorly understood but should be considered when evaluating the antineoplastic effects of statins. Emerging evidence suggests that atherosclerosis and cancer have similar underlying molecular mechanisms, both having lipid abnormalities and a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, statins target lipid metabolism, have significant anti-inflammatory effects, and can influence cardiovascular mortality. Recent studies show that statins may have chemopreventive effects and may complement cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiotherapy as a biologic response modifier in established cancer, but current data do not support their use as monotherapy. The preclinical data supporting anticancer activity, their additional health benefits, and the safety and relative low cost of statins compared to other 'targeted' agents currently under development all favor conducting prospective clinical trials of these drugs in cancer chemoprevention and therapy.\", 19900082: StringElement('To date, there have been conflicting data on the prevalence of HPV in primary breast carcinoma, with a median prevalence of 35%.

Endothelial dysfunction, characterised by impaired endothelium-dependent vasoreactivity, is the first sign of blood vessel damage that precedes morphological changes of the vessel wall. With other factors altered bioavailability of nitric oxide, the most potent endothelium-derived vasodilator, contributes to the changes in vascular tone and integrity. In addition to the impairment of vascular reactivity and permeability, other anti-atherosclerotic functions of nitric oxide are also diminished, which may result in activated monocyte, leukocyte and platelet adhesion to the endothelium, increased platelet aggregation, lipoprotein influx to the subendothelial space and smooth muscle proliferation. Hyperglycaemia-induced increased oxidative stress and impairment of antioxidant defence are suggested to play a role in the pathomechanism of vascular damage, partly by influencing nitric oxide. Both in experimental and clinical Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes mellitus the apparently conflicting data of increased, unaltered or diminished nitric oxide action suggests a complex, time and localisation-dependent alteration of vascular function.

It has an association with increased morbidity and mortality, increased costs and it remains the third most common cause of hospital-acquired kidney failure. CIN is usually defined as an increase in serum creatinine by either at least 0.5 mg/dl or by 25% from baseline within the first 48 hours after contrast administration, in the absence of other causes of renal function impairment. In its pathogenesis have been implicated 2 main mechanisms: renal vasoconstriction resulting in medullary hypoxia and direct cytotoxic effects of the contrast agents. There are several risk factors for radiocontrast nephrotoxicity but patients with underlying renal insufficiency or diabetic nephropathy with renal insufficiency have the greatest risk. Other classic risk factors include: advanced age, peri-procedural intravascular depletion, congestive heart failure. Finally, toxicity also depends on the volume, type of contrast administered and concomitant use of other nephrotoxic drugs. Since there is no specific treatment for CIN and it is limited to supportive measures, prevention is the best way to deal with this condition. In this setting it is important to use lower doses of a low or iso-osmolal agent and avoid volume depletion. Nowadays it is recommended to do volume expansion prior to and continued for several hours after the procedure. Randomized controlled trials suggest that isotonic intravenous fluids, particularly isotonic bicarbonate, confer better protection. Several pharmacologic approaches have been tested to decrease the risk of CIN in patients with preexisting renal disease, based in the mechanisms by which contrast medium is believed to cause nephrotoxicity. However, with the exception of some antioxidant agents, few of those adjunctive therapies have shown any consistent benefit.

On the other hand, there are conflicting data regarding the ability of ACE inhibitors to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events in patients with vascular disease and preserved left ventricular systolic function. Results of the main randomized clinical trials that evaluated the benefit of ACE inhibitors in patients with vascular disease are discussed in this editorial. In particular, the different prognostic impact of ACE inhibitors in high-risk patients with and without heart failure or preserved left ventricular systolic function is examined in detail. The possible impact of lipids and statins on the effect of ACE inhibitors is also discussed.

Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are widely explored for biomedical applications such as intracellular transporters for (bio)molecules, and represent promising future tools for efficient and safe cell therapy. Due to their nanoscale dimensions, the ability to interact with cells, and their easy functionalization, CNTs are close-to-ideal vectors for an efficient and safe cell therapy, obviating the risks associated with the use of viral vectors. Notwithstanding, conflicting data concerning the biocompatibility of CNTs have been reported in the literature; while some studies point toward very low toxicity of CNTs both in vitro and in vivo, others reveal various toxic effects such as oxidative stress, DNA damage, and cell apoptosis. Thus, standardized methods and independent test systems are urgently needed to verify cytotoxicity data in this research field. In this chapter, we summarize the used methods and the achieved main results in our laboratories concerning multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) biocompatibility studies. The in vitro response of human neuroblastoma cell line and primary mouse neurons was investigated following the exposure to different samples of MWCNTs in order to evaluate their effects on cell viability, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Moreover, in vivo neurocompatibility tests were carried out through injections in mouse brains.', 28256552: u\"Solving problematic phylogenetic relationships often requires high quality genome data. However, for many organisms such data are still not available. Among rodents, the phylogenetic position of the beaver has always attracted special interest. The arrangement of the beaver's masseter (jaw-closer) muscle once suggested a strong affinity to some sciurid rodents (e.g., squirrels), placing them in the Sciuromorpha suborder. Modern molecular data, however, suggested a closer relationship of beaver to the representatives of the mouse-related clade, but significant data from virtually homoplasy-free markers (for example retroposon insertions) for the exact position of the beaver have not been available. We derived a gross genome assembly from deposited genomic Illumina paired-end reads and extracted thousands of potential phylogenetically informative retroposon markers using the new bioinformatics coordinate extractor fastCOEX, enabling us to evaluate different hypotheses for the phylogenetic position of the beaver.

Depending on the cell lineage and stage of maturation, LMP1 and CD40 can have synergistic, antagonist or unrelated effects. Previous publications have suggested that both TRAF2 and TRAF3 move into lipid rafts upon LMP1 expression or CD40 activation, whereas their proteolysis is only enhanced by CD40. However CD40-induced proteolysis of TRAF2 has only been reported in murine cells, and there are conflicting data regarding translocation of TRAF2 into lipid rafts. We therefore investigated TRAF2 and TRAF3 modifications induced by CD40 and LMP1 signaling in a panel of human cell lines of lymphoid and epithelial origins. Upon CD40 stimulation, a marked redistribution of TRAF2 into the buoyant raft fraction was observed in all cell lines and was often associated with a similar redistribution of TRAF3. In contrast, only TRAF3 was redistributed into the raft fraction upon LMP1 expression. Moreover parallel changes in subcellular distribution of TRAF2 and TRAF3 were recorded by electron microscopy. A significant decrease in TRAF2 and TRAF3 concentrations triggered by CD40 ligation was observed in only 1 cell line and there was no evidence that this decrease was required for the negative feed-back on JNK activation. TRAF2 redistribution into raft-like complexes thus appears as the most significant event distinctive of CD40 and LMP1 signaling. On the other hand, the parallel influence of CD40 and LMP1 on TRAF3 redistribution is consistent with functional similarities between the CD40-TRAF3 and LMP1-TRAF3 axes.', 16289529: 'We have previously isolated anti-FcepsilonRIalpha autoantibodies from phage libraries of healthy donors and urticaria patients. Strikingly, the same antibody, LTMalpha15, was isolated from both libraries. Sequence analysis revealed a germline configuration of the LTMalpha15 variable heavy (V(H)) chain with a slightly mutated variable light (V(L)) chain supporting its classification as a natural autoantibody. Distribution analysis of anti-FcepsilonRIalpha autoantibodies by functional or serological tests delivered conflicting data. For this reason we have developed a new real-time PCR to analyse the distribution of LTMalpha15V(H) in healthy donors and urticaria patients. Our new bioinformatic program permitted the design of a minor groove binder (MGB) TaqMan probe that specifically detected the LTMalpha15V(H). We were able to demonstrate a broad range of rearranged V(H) gene copy number without any correlation to the state of health. Monitoring LTMalpha15V(H) gene copy number in a single donor over a period of 70 days revealed a time-related fluctuation of circulating B cells carrying LTMalpha15V(H).

The detection of the fusion gene product by RT-PCR using primers at both sides of the breakpoints has been advocated as a diagnostic tool. By applying this technique appropriate internal controls are required. We found that the use of normal non-rearranged EWS mRNA as an internal control for RNA quality may lead to conflicting data. We obtained PCR products of the expected size for the normal EWS mRNA in both RNA and DNA samples, suggesting, the existence of one or more EWS pseudogenes. A 109 bp sequence at the 5' end of this PCR-product contained a correctly spliced exon junction and was 97% homologous to the EWS cDNA sequence. Similarly two such junctions were found in a 346 bp sequence of the 3' end, which was 89% homologous.

The present study aimed to determine the survival rate and effect of adipose tissue-derived MSCs (ADMSCs) in tumor growth using bioluminescence imaging (BLI) and ultrasound (US) in an osteosarcoma xenograft model. Firefly luciferase-expressing ADMSCs combined with the osteosarcoma cell line UMR-106 in 4 different proportions (5, 10, 15 and 25%, named G1-G4, respectively) were xenografted into the right flanks of nude mice. The same number of UMR-106 cells was inoculated into the contralateral side of each mouse. Serial bioluminescence images were captured over 16 days to monitor the presence of ADMSCs in each group of 5 animals. The tumor volume was measured by ultra-high resolution US, and the tumor volume ratio (AMDSC mixed xenograft/control xenograft) was obtained to evaluate the effect of AMDSCs on tumor growth. Immunohistochemistry was performed to confirm the distribution of residual AMDSCs in the tumor. In G1, G2 and G3, the suppression of tumor growth by AMDSCs was noted in 2/5, 4/5 and 4/5 mice, respectively. However, accelerated tumor growth was noted in G4, which had the highest proportion of ADMSCs. The tumor volume ratio was significantly lower in G2 and G3 compared to G4, by Mann-Whitney U test (P=0.0159). Bioluminescence images demonstrated a serial decrement of the reporter gene for ADMSCs in the tumor mass without evidence of proliferation. Immunohistochemistry staining revealed minimal residual ADMSCs in the tumor periphery. Taken together, our data revealed that direct inoculation of ADMSCs into a tumor xenograft caused the death of the majority of ADMSCs in the tumor mass. Furthermore, relatively low proportions of ADMSCs suppressed the growth of osteosarcoma, while higher proportions showed a tumor-promoting effect.', 8837395: 'Mycobacterium avium is a significant opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised patients. Moreover, the prevalence of infections in patients without known predisposing conditions has also been increasing in recent years. Patients would greatly benefit from early diagnosis of disseminated infection.

We have evaluated the use of the phagocytosis-induced MIG protein of M. avium as a diagnostic antigen. Serum antibody levels of M. avium-infected, HIV-negative patients were significantly elevated for the recombinant MIG (p < 0.001) and also for M. avium whole-cell antigens (p < 0.025) as compared to controls. In contrast, HIV-infected patients with disseminated M. avium infection demonstrated also elevated levels of antibody for the whole-cell antigen (p < 0.00001) but a decreased reactivity for the MIG antigen (p < 0.007). The recombinant antigen proved to have no cross-reactivity with M. tuberculosis antigens as antibody levels were decreased in tuberculosis patients (p < 0.001).

Physiological concentrations induce multiple and reversible biological effects. They concern regulatory mechanisms of gene expression conducing to promote markers of cell differentiation, apoptosis and cell growth control. The described hyperacetylation of histones and the induction of several immune or non-immune cell-activating mediators are consistent with the pleiotropic stimulatory effect of the agent. Butyric acid is considered as a biological response modifier (BRM) and is an interesting tool for biological studies. The history of butyric acid as a putative medication in human health is spanning since 60 years and is confusing in part because of conflicting data between exciting experimental results and clinical trials. In light of minimal impact of systemic therapy and the short half-life of the saline molecule used, it is evident that continuous infusions of butyrate are required to improve the efficacy of the treatment. Butyric acid has been viewed with skepticism because of less convenient for long-term chronic therapy. New experimental data from several studies conduced within the past decade with butyric derivatives, delivery systems, and long-acting prodrugs, have demonstrated the practical value of the therapeutic concept.

One area of particular interest for the adoption of VCDs has been in the setting of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) in which multiple antiplatelet strategies are often employed leading to a high risk of bleeding. Bleeding in ACS has been shown to be a powerful independent predictor of 30-day mortality. Recently, investigators have reported that VCDs reduce access site bleeding in the setting of ACS. In our review, we use several selected representative clinical trials to provide a historical account for the use of VCDs. We also provide for a review of data as it relates to access site bleeding in ACS along with analysis showing that VCDs may potentially provide for reductions in bleeding and vascular complications in patients with ACS undergoing PCI.', 26818179: '-1BW of MWCNTs.

Of the three enzymes assayed, AST displayed a peculiar pattern, especially in the MWCNTs intraperitoneally treated group. TP level was significantly increased in the orally treated MWCNTs group.

Delirium is associated with a number of adverse clinical and social outcomes with higher financial cost and risk of developing dementia, as well as increased likelihood of need for residential care. Current interventions for the prevention of delirium typically involve recognition and amelioration of modifiable risk factors and treatment of underlying conditions that predispose the individual to delirium. A number of pharmacological strategies for delirium prevention have been tested. Antipsychotic medications are used for treatment of agitation in the setting of delirium when other measures have failed, but their efficacy in prevention is limited by study heterogeneity and concerns about tolerability. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are effective in the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease but do not appear to be effective in preventing delirium. Melatonin and melatonin agonists have a rather benign side effect profile and show promise for prevention of delirium in medically unwell individuals. The alpha-2 agonist, dexmedetomidine may be helpful in the intensive care unit setting but intravenous route of administration and need for close clinical supervision limits its use in the wider hospital environment. Other agents such as benzodiazepines, corticosteroids, statins and gabapentin have been suggested but lack evidence to support their role in delirium prevention.

While linear growth is easy to assess, nutritional status is more complicated, with reports often compromised by the use of simple measures, such as weight and the body mass index, to assess nutritional status rather than more appropriate and sophisticated techniques to measure body composition. This review is an update on what is currently known about nutritional status as determined by body composition in paediatric IBD. Further, this review will focus on the impact of biologics on growth in paediatric IBD. Significant lean mass deficits have been reported in children with IBD compared with controls, and there is evidence these deficits persist over time. Furthermore, data imply that gender differences exist in body composition, both at diagnosis and in response to treatment. With respect to growth improvements following treatment with biologics, there are conflicting data. While some studies report enhancement of growth, others do not. The relationship between disease severity, impaired growth and the requirement for biologics needs to be considered when interpreting these data.

BPA binds to ER\\u03b2 without activating any receptor activities. On the other hand, BPA inhibits E2-induced genomic activity of ER\\u03b2 as well as ER\\u03b2 extra-nuclear activities (i.e., ER\\u03b2:p38 association and p38 activation). As a consequence, BPA impairs the E2-induced activation of the apoptotic cascade which is at the root of the protective role played by the hormone against colon cancer growth.

Afferent fibres in the vagus and splanchnic nerves have been studied electrophysiologically and much has been learnt from single fibre recordings. Splanchnic afferent fibres generally terminate in multiple mechanosensitive endings in the mesentery and serosa where they are in a position to monitor tension on the mesenteric attachments. Other mechanoreceptors following a mainly vagal pathway behave as if they are functionally in-series with the muscle elements of the gut wall and signal muscle tension generated passively by distension and actively during contraction. A third group of afferent endings supply the GI mucosa where they are in a position to signal information on the physical and chemical environment of the gut lumen. A complex picture of mucosal sensitivity has emerged with subpopulations of receptors with polymodal sensitivity and quality-specific mechanoreceptors, thermoreceptors and chemoreceptors. Unfortunately, there is little concensus amongst the different research groups because of different experimental paradigms. One group describes specific chemoreceptors, other groups fail to find them. In this minireview I have speculated on the cause of the often conflicting data on GI afferents and the implications this has for the interpretation of visceral receptor mechanisms.', 20965156: \"The neuroprotective effects of estrogen have been demonstrated consistently in cellular and animal studies but the evidence in women remains conflicted. We explored the window of opportunity hypothesis in relation to cognitive aging and dementia. In particular, we reviewed existing literature, reanalyzed some of our data, and combined results graphically. Current evidence suggests that estrogen may have beneficial, neutral, or detrimental effects on the brain depending on age at the time of treatment, type of menopause (natural versus medically or surgically induced), or stage of menopause. The comparison of women who underwent bilateral oophorectomy with referent women provided evidence for a sizeable neuroprotective effect of estrogen before age 50 years. Several case-control studies and cohort studies also showed neuroprotective effects in women who received estrogen treatment (ET) in the early postmenopausal stage (most commonly at ages 50-60 years). The majority of women in those observational studies had undergone natural menopause and were treated for the relief of menopausal symptoms. However, recent clinical trials by the Women's Health Initiative showed that women who initiated ET alone or in combination with a progestin in the late postmenopausal stage (ages 65-79 years) experienced an increased risk of dementia and cognitive decline regardless of the type of menopause. The current conflicting data can be explained by the window of opportunity hypothesis suggesting that the neuroprotective effects of estrogen depend on age at the time of administration, type of menopause, and stage of menopause. Therefore, women who underwent bilateral oophorectomy before the onset of menopause or women who experienced premature or early natural menopause should be considered for hormonal treatment until approximately age 51 years.\", 26670885: StringElement('Conflicting data were reported with respect to the retinal phenotype of mice with dual perturbation of the CCL2 and CX3CR1 genes.

The development of calcifications (33 per cent) can be the most debilitating consequence of JDMS .

There are conflicting data concerning immunological abnormalities in JDMS , but there appears to be impairment of natural killing and evidence of complement activation. The frequent positive ANA in JDMS raises the speculation of its relationship to the antinuclear antibody, Jo-1, found in some adults with PM, which has specificity for tRNAHis. Most newly diagnosed JDMS patients have antibodies to Coxsackie B which may be related to the pathogenesis of this disease.

Estimates of the frequency of generalized bone loss have varied with the measurement technique used and the study design. Studies using dual-photon absorptiometry with a radioactive source have yielded conflicting data. The most recent studies of bone mineral density used dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, which is currently the best method in terms of reproducibility and precision; results suggested bone loss in the proximal femur, whereas lumbar spine measurements were usually normal or very slightly decreased. Findings from the few longitudinal studies are discordant; this may be ascribable to differences in bone mass measurement techniques, study population characteristics, and follow-up duration. Whereas bone loss was not demonstrated in the earliest longitudinal studies, recent investigations suggested that bone mineral density was decreased in rheumatoid arthritis patients as compared with controls. Corticosteroid therapy, even in daily dosages of less than 10 mg/d prednisone-equivalent, was associated with an approximately 10% decrease in bone mass after six months, in both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies.

Severe dysregulation of the inflammatory process may provoke or aggravate postoperative complications, e.g. increased susceptibility to infections, inadequate stress reactions and hypercatabolism. Anaesthetics have been suspected of impairing various functions of the immune system either directly, by disturbing the functions of immune-competent cells, or indirectly by modulating the stress response. In the past, conflicting data on the possible immunological side effects of anaesthetics have been published. Potential reasons for these controversial findings include heterogeneous patient study groups with diverse pre-existing diseases, lack of standardisation of surgical procedures, major differences in the length and severity of surgical tissue injury and a small number of randomised studies.

These strikingly opposite effects as a function of antibody isotype occurred across both strong H-1 (Ag-B) and moderate non-H-1 histocompatibility barriers. However, IgM and IgG directed against non-H-1 specificities were far more effective, respectively, in either curtailing or prolonging renal allograft survival. In the Fischer to Lewis strain combination, this was reflected in a 4-fold diminution in median survival time of IgM-treated recipients from 115 to 31 days, in contrast to indefinitely prolonged survival of IgG-treated recipients (greater than 350 days).

Reduced skeletal muscle mass or sarcopenia contributes to increased mortality and adverse consequences of cirrhosis. Failure of reversal of sarcopenia of cirrhosis after liver transplantation is not well recognized. Six temporally, geographically, and methodologically distinct follow-up studies in 304 cirrhotics reported conflicting data on changes in indirect measures of skeletal muscle mass after transplantation. Distinct measures of body composition but not skeletal muscle mass were used and did not focus on the clinical consequences of sarcopenia after transplantation. A number of studies reported an initial rapid postoperative loss of lean mass followed by incomplete recovery with a maximum follow-up of 2 years. Posttransplant sarcopenia may be responsible for metabolic syndrome and impaired quality of life after liver transplantation. Potential reasons for failure to reverse sarcopenia after liver transplantation include use of immunosuppressive agents [mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and calcineurin inhibitors] that impair skeletal muscle growth and protein accretion. Repeated hospitalizations, posttransplant infections, and renal failure also contribute to posttransplant sarcopenia. Finally, recovery from muscle deconditioning is limited by lack of systematic nutritional and physical-activity-based interventions to improve muscle mass. Despite the compelling data on sarcopenia before liver transplantation, the impact of posttransplant sarcopenia on clinical outcomes is not known. There is a compelling need for studies to examine the mechanisms and consequences of sarcopenia post liver transplantation to permit development of therapies to prevent and reverse this disorder.', 27366708: StringElement('There are conflicting data regarding the prevalence of colorectal polyp in patients with acromegaly.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'BACKGROUND', u'Label': u'BACKGROUND'}), 16301883: 'There are conflicting data in the literature about the effects of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) on blood sugar.

However, conflicting data exist regarding the effects of this drug on the growth of metastases in preclinical models. Here we use 4T1 and RENCA tumour cells, which both form lung metastases in Balb/c mice, to re-address the effects of sunitinib on the progression of metastatic disease in mice. We show that treatment of mice with sunitinib prior to intravenous injection of tumour cells can promote the seeding and growth of 4T1 lung metastases, but not RENCA lung metastases, showing that this effect is cell line dependent. However, increased metastasis occurred only upon administration of a very high sunitinib dose, but not when lower, clinically relevant doses were used. Mechanistically, high dose sunitinib led to a pericyte depletion effect in the lung vasculature that correlated with increased seeding of metastasis. By administering sunitinib to mice after intravenous injection of tumour cells, we demonstrate that while sunitinib does not inhibit the growth of 4T1 lung tumour nodules, it does block the growth of RENCA lung tumour nodules. This contrasting response was correlated with increased myeloid cell recruitment and persistent vascularisation in 4T1 tumours, whereas RENCA tumours recruited less myeloid cells and were more profoundly devascularised upon sunitinib treatment. Finally, we show that progression of 4T1 tumours in sunitinib treated mice results in increased hypoxia and increased glucose metabolism in these tumours and that this is associated with a poor outcome. Taken together, these data suggest that the effects of sunitinib on tumour progression are dose-dependent and tumour model-dependent. These findings have relevance for understanding how anti-angiogenic agents may influence disease progression when used in the adjuvant or metastatic setting in cancer patients.', 28968771: 'Characterization of the within-host genetic diversity of viral pathogens is required for selection of effective treatment of some important viral infections, e.g. HIV, HBV and HCV. Despite the technical ability of detection, there are conflicting data regarding the clinical significance of low-frequency variants, partially because of the difficulty of their distinguishing from experimental artifacts. The issue of cross-contamination is relevant for all highly sensitive techniques, including deep sequencing: even trace contamination leads to a significant increase of false positives in identified SNVs. Determination of infections by multiple genotypes of some viruses, the incidence of which can be considerable, especially in risk groups, is also clinically significant in some cases. We developed a new viral reference-guided assembler, VirGenA, that can separate mixtures of strains of different intraspecies genetic groups (genotypes, subtypes, clades, etc.) and assemble a separate consensus sequence for each group in a mixture. It produced long assemblies for mixture components of extremely low frequencies (<1%) allowing detection of cross-contamination of samples by divergent genotypes. We tested VirGenA on both clinical and simulated data. On both types of data, VirGenA shows better or similar results than the existing de novo assemblers.

This is a prospective evaluation of consecutively identified patients at our institution diagnosed with EoE from March 1, 2005 to June 1, 2007. Thirty-two patients with biopsies consistent with EoE completed a symptom survey and 30 underwent esophageal manometry. The majority of EoE patients (23/30, 77%) had a normal end-expiratory lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure (normal range 10-35), whereas six patients had a low-normal LES pressure (6-9 mm Hg) and one patient had a decreased LES pressure (<5 mm Hg).

It was speculated that extensive squamous metaplasia could explain the presence of t(11;19) translocation in a subset of WTs.

The transcription factors FOXO1a and FOXO3a have been shown to bind these elements, but there are conflicting reports as to whether this binding correlates with the action of insulin on gene transcription. Some researchers concluded, from overexpression experiments using FOXO1a, that binding correlated with the insulin response, whereas others concluded, mainly from gel retardation competition experiments using FOXO3a, that it did not. We show here that, although these factors can differentially activate gene transcription in a context-dependent manner, these conflicting data are not explained by a difference in FOXO1a and FOXO3a binding specificity. Instead, we find that gel retardation competition and binding experiments give different results; the latter reveal a correlation between FOXO1a/3a binding and the inhibition of basal G6Pase gene transcription by insulin. In addition, these data show that the binding of FOXO1a/3a to two adjacent IRSs in the G6Pase promoter is cooperative and that promoter context alters the specific IRS base requirements for FOXO1a-stimulated fusion gene expression. Surprisingly, an analysis of insulin action mediated through the G6Pase and IGF binding protein-1 IRSs in the context of a heterologous thymidine kinase promoter reveals that signaling through the latter does not support the accepted model for insulin-stimulated FOXO nuclear exclusion.', 11927386: 'Fatty acids have both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on insulin secretion. Long-term exposure to fatty acids results in impaired insulin secretion whilst acute exposure has generally been found to enhance insulin release. However, there are conflicting data in the literature as to the relative efficacy of various fatty acids and on the glucose dependency of the stimulatory effect. Moreover, there is little information on the responses of human islets in vitro to fatty acids. We have therefore studied the acute effects of a range of fatty acids on insulin secretion from rat and human islets of Langerhans at different glucose concentrations. Fatty acids (0.5 mM) acutely stimulated insulin release from rat islets of Langerhans in static incubations in a glucose-dependent manner. The greatest effect was seen at high glucose concentration (16.7 mM) and little or no response was elicited at 3.3 or 8.7 mM glucose. Long-chain fatty acids (palmitate and stearate) were more effective than medium-chain (octanoate). Saturated fatty acids (palmitate, stearate) were more effective than unsaturated (palmitoleate, linoleate, elaidate). Stimulation of insulin secretion by fatty acids was also studied in perifused rat islets. No effects were observed at 3.3 mM glucose but fatty acids markedly potentiated the effect of 16.7 mM glucose. The combination of fatty acid plus glucose was less effective when islets had been first challenged with glucose alone. The insulin secretory responses to fatty acids of human islets in static incubations were similar to those of rat islets. In order to examine whether the responses to glucose and to fatty acids could be varied independently we used an animal model in which lactating rats are fed a low-protein diet during early lactation. Islets from rats whose mothers had been malnourished during lactation were still able to respond effectively to fatty acids despite a lowered secretory response to glucose. These data emphasise the complex interrelationships between nutrients in the control of insulin release and support the view that fatty acids play an important role in glucose homeostasis during undernutrition.', 10893147: \"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) belongs to the recently recognized Arteriviridae family within the genus Arterivirus, order Nidovirales, which also includes equine arteritis virus (EAV), lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV). Mature viral particles are composed of an envelope 50-72 nm in diameter, with an isometric core about 20-30 nm enclosing a linear positive-stranded RNA genome of approximately 15 kb. The virions are assembled by the budding of preformed nucleocapsids into the lumen of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and/or Golgi apparatus. The mature virions are then released by exocytosis. The viral genome contains eight open reading frames (ORFs) which are transcribed in cells as a nested set of subgenomic mRNAs. The ORF1a and ORF1b situated at the 5'end of the genome represent nearly 75% of the viral genome and code for proteins with apparent replicase and polymerase activities. The major structural proteins consist of a 25 kDa envelope glycoprotein (GP5), an 18-19 kDa unglycosylated membrane protein (M), and a 15 kDa nucleocapsid (N) protein, encoded by ORFs 5, 6 and 7, respectively. The N protein is the more abundant protein of the virion and is highly antigenic, which therefore makes it a suitable candidate for the detection of virus-specific antibodies and diagnosis of the disease. Four to five domains of antigenic importance have been identified for the N protein, a common conformational antigenic site for European and North American strains being localized in the central region of the protein. In cells and virions, both M and GP5 occur in heterodimeric complexes linked by disulfide bonds. The expression products of ORFs 2 and 4 are also incorporated into virus particles as additional minor membrane-associated glycoproteins designated as GP2 and GP4, with M(r) of 29 and 31 kDa, respectively. The structural nature of the ORF3 product, a highly glycosylated protein with an apparent M(r) of 42 kDa, is still being debated, in view of the apparently conflicting data on its presence in virus particles. Nonetheless, the GP3 of North American and European strains has been shown to be antigenic, providing protection for piglets against PRRSV infection in the absence of a noticeable neutralizing humoral response. Pigs exposed to the native form of GP5 by means of DNA immunization develop specific neutralizing and protecting antibodies. The GP5 is involved in antigenic variability, apoptosis, and possibly antibody-dependent enhancement phenomena. The GP4 also possesses antigenic determinants that trigger the immune system to produce neutralizing antibodies. Each of the PRRSV structural proteins carries common and type-specific antigenic determinants that permit the ability to differentiate between European and North American strains. The potential use of the PRRSV structural proteins in subunit recombinant-type vaccines is also discussed.\", 22409692: StringElement('To describe the frequency, characteristics and outcomes of reports of possible harms related to medical devices submitted to the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) using data made publicly available on the TGA website.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'OBJECTIVE', u'Label': u'OBJECTIVE'}), 17936221: 'The possibility that HCV infects lymphoid cells has been widely discussed. Evidence in favor of HCV tropism for lymphoid cells derives from a series of data including: (1) the higher sensitivity of testing HCVRNA in PBMC than in serum or plasma samples, with possible detection of HCV RNA-positive PBMC in the absence of HCV viremia; (2) short-term cultures of PBMC which yield a significant increase in the amount of viral RNA on stimulation by mitogens; (3) results of \"in situ\" methods (i.e. in situ hybridization, immunofluorescence); (4) efficient infection of lymphoid cell lines or PBMC from normal individuals; (5) the persistence of HCV RNA in PBMC obtained from HCV-positive subjects and injected into SCID mice; (6) the long-term persistence of HCV RNA in PBMC in spite of HCV RNA negativity of serum and liver in sustained responder patients after therapy. The principal criticisms concerning effective HCV infection of lymphoid cells arise from technical difficulty in identifying HCV RNA replicative intermediate in these elements. Conflicting data may also result from differences in PBMC infection by different genotypes, samples taken at different stages in the disease process and differences in the sensitivity of detection methods, as well as low replication levels and/or proportion of infected PBMC. Interesting available data about HCV lymphotropism, which is possibly important in influencing the natural history of infection, include: (1) possible preferential viral tropism for specific PBMC subsets; (2) different lymphotropism of different viral strains; (3) selection of distinctive viral strains; (4) identification of putative HCV cell receptors; (5) association between determination of HCV lymphatic infection and t(14; 18) translocation.

Tolerance occurs with any dosing regimen that results in nitrate accumulation in the plasma or nearly-constant plasma concentrations, as is the case with multiple daily doses of oral nitrates or continuous application of transdermal patch systems. Nitrate tolerance can be prevented by the interval treatment. This encompasses incorporation of an application-free interval which prevents meaningful nitrate accumulation such that, from a low baseline level, renewed drug administration leads to an increase in the nitrate plasma concentration greater than 2.5-fold. From controlled studies, dosing regimens for interval treatment proven to be effective have been designated for isosorbide dinitrate and isosorbide 5-mononitrate, as well as for transdermal nitroglycerin patch systems.

Breast-conservation therapy undoubtedly represents substantial progress for a better quality of life for women with early-stage breast cancer. However, lumpectomy is associated with a substantial proportion, approximately 10-20%, of local recurrence in long-term follow-up studies even after accounting for postoperative radiotherapy. Risk factors for local failure include margin status, young age and an extensive intraductal component. Young age and family history strongly suggest the need for genetic testing before initiation of treatment. Women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations should be informed about the increased risk of contralateral breast cancer and ipsilateral failure after breast-conservation therapy. Bilateral mastectomy should also be offered as a treatment option. There is controversy over whether current effective adjuvant treatment, including chemotherapy and endocrine therapy, beyond appropriate local treatment as surgery and radiotherapy, can improve local control. Instead of debate over whether an ipsilateral tumor after breast-conservation therapy is local recurrence or a new primary cancer by analyzing conflicting data lacking strong evidence, efforts should be focused on reducing this risk irrespective of origin. Selecting women for breast-conservation therapy and achieving margin control can reduce ipsilateral failures.', 8660851: 'Several recent reports presented conflicting data on the action of IL-4 and IL-13 in regulating the release of proinflammatory cytokines by human monocytes. Here we show that the regulation of cytokine release by IL-4 and IL-13 could be either inhibitory or stimulatory in LPS-treated murine peritoneal macrophages. When macrophages were treated with IL-13 or IL-4, between 6 and 24 hr prior to endotoxin challenge, TNF alpha and IL-6 levels were significantly augmented. On the other hand, when the cells were cotreated with LPS plus IL-13 or IL-4, the release of TNF alpha and IL-6 was inhibited. These effects of IL-4 and IL-13 were associated with the modulation of IL-10; pretreatment resulted in a decrease, whereas cotreatment gave rise to a dramatic increase in IL-10 levels. The inhibitory effect of IL-4 and IL-13 on the release of TNF alpha was partially reversed by neutralizing anti-IL10 antibody, and the inhibition of IL-6 release was completely reversed by the antibody. These data suggest that the mechanism of action of IL-13 and IL-4 in modulating macrophage TNF alpha and IL-6 release partially involves IL-10.', 19820404: StringElement('Conflicting data have been reported in the literature about the role of retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) in insulin sensitivity, type 2 diabetes, and obesity in humans.

The great variety of nanoparticles (NPs), in vitro test systems and cell lines led to a vast amount of publications with conflicting data. To identify the decisive principles of these variabilities, we conducted an intercomparison study of collaborating laboratories within the German DFG Priority Program SPP1313, using well-defined experimental parameters and well-characterized NPs. The participants analyzed the in vitro biocompatibility of silica and polymer NPs on human hepatoma HepG2 cells. Nanoparticle mediated effects on cell metabolism, internalization, and inflammation were measured. All laboratories showed that both nanoparticle formulations were internalized and had a low cytotoxicity profile. Interestingly, small variations in nanoparticle preparation, cell handling and the type of culture slide influenced the nanoparticle stability and the outcomes of cell assays. The round robin test demonstrated the importance of the use of clearly defined and characterized NPs and parameters for reproducible results across laboratories.

However, conflicting data have been reported on HLA association and melanoma. We report here serologic and molecular analysis by polymerase chain reaction sequence-specific primers (PCR-SSP) and PCR sequence-specific oligonucleotides (PCR-SSO) of HLA class II DRB1 and DQB1 loci in 132 patients with melanoma and 102 ethnically matched controls. Molecular typing of DQB1 polymorphism showed a significant increase of DQB1 *0501 (25.0% versus 14.7%; p = 0.038). Moreover, an increase of DQB1*0301, which was present in 62.8% of patients and 54.9% of controls (p = 0.136), was noted. Because DQB1*0501 and DQB1*0301 are strongly linked to DRB1*01 and DRB1*11, respectively, both found increased in patients with melanoma, to look for a more stringent association with a particular allele specificity of the DR locus, we performed PCR-SSP high-resolution typing of DR1 and DR11 positive subjects. Results showed no significant difference between the frequencies of the alleles found in patients with respect to controls. Analysis of the distribution of DQB1*0501 and DQB1*0301 according to the AJCC clinical stage of the disease showed no significant difference in the frequency of these alleles between the localized and the metastatic form of the disease. However, none of the HLA class II alleles showed significant association after correction of the p value. These results indicate that HLA class II alleles may not contribute to a strong susceptibility to melanoma, at least in Italian patients.', 11278203: 'The gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists, cetrorelix and ganirelix, have both been approved for ovarian stimulation to prevent a premature LH surge. Since GnRH receptors and their gene expression have been detected in human ovary, concern has risen over whether GnRH antagonists might affect ovarian function. Three large trials which compared GnRH agonists (used in the standard protocol worldwide), with the new antagonist treatment found no significant differences concerning the most important goals, e.g. pregnancy rate, fertilization and quality of oocytes. However, the concentration of oestradiol, and the pregnancy and implantation rates were lower in GnRH antagonist-treated patients. These findings again fuelled the debate about the possible extrapituitary effects of GnRH antagonists. Here, we review the conflicting data in the literature on the ovarian effects of GnRH antagonists and discuss our own results. In our view, it is unlikely that GnRH antagonists have a relevant impact on ovarian steroidogenesis and function; however, GnRH antagonists may exert other effects on the ovary.', 29175676: StringElement('Clinical trials examining the therapeutic benefit of modafinil in MS fatigue provide conflicting data.

Potential factors regulating expression of both MCH and the orexins include fasting and leptin. Previous studies have generated conflicting data and, as there is little leptin receptor expressed in the lateral hypothalamus, it is likely that any observed leptin effects on these peptides are indirect. In this study, we examined MCH and preproorexin expression in mice in physiological states of starvation, with or without leptin administration, in addition to characterizing MCH and preproorexin expression in well-known obesity models, including ob/ob and UCP-DTA mice. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) expression in the arcuate nucleus was used as a positive control. After a 60-h fast, expression of both NPY and MCH mRNA was increased (by 148 and 33%, respectively) while preproorexin expression in the murine LHA did not change. Leptin administration to fasted mice blunted the rise in MCH and NPY expression towards control levels. In contrast, there was a 78% increase in preproorexin expression in fasted mice in response to peripheral leptin administration. MCH expression was increased (by 116%) in ob/ob mice at baseline, as we have previously reported. In addition, leptin treatment of ob/ob mice blunted the increase in MCH expression. In contrast, preproorexin expression did not differ in the leptin-deficient ob/ob mice or in the obese hyperleptinemic brown adipose tissue deficient (UCP-DTA) mice in comparison with controls. In summary, MCH expression is increased in two states of decreased leptin, fasting and ob/ob mice, and leptin replacement blunts MCH expression in both paradigms. Thus, MCH expression appears to be regulated by leptin. In contrast, preproorexin expression does not respond acutely to fasting, although it is acutely increased by leptin treatment during fasting. These preproorexin responses are in contrast to those seen with well-characterized orexigenic neuropeptides, such as NPY and AgRP, suggesting that appetite regulation may not be a significant physiological role of orexins. This conclusion is further supported by the observation that orexin ablated mice have arousal and not feeding deficits.', 19496830: StringElement('To evaluate the prevalence of migraine/severe headaches in those with and without general obesity and abdominal obesity (Abd-O) and the effect of gender and age on this relationship.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'OBJECTIVE', u'Label': u'OBJECTIVE'}), 26040981: 'Recurrent gain on chromosome 3q26 encompassing the gene locus for the transcription factor SOX2 is a frequent event in human squamous cell carcinoma, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Numerous studies demonstrated that SOX2 expression and function is related to distinct aspects of tumor cell pathophysiology. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not well understood, and the correlation between SOX2 expression and clinical outcome revealed conflicting data. Transcriptional profiling after silencing of SOX2 expression in a HNSCC cell line identified a set of up-regulated genes related to cell motility (e.g. VIM, FN1, CDH2). The inverse regulation of SOX2 and aforementioned genes was validated in 18 independent HNSCC cell lines from different anatomical sites. The inhibition of cell migration and invasion by SOX2 was confirmed by constant or conditional gene silencing and accelerated motility of HNSCC cells after SOX2 silencing was partially reverted by down-regulation of vimentin. In a retrospective study, SOX2 expression was determined by immunohistochemical staining on tissue microarrays containing primary tumor specimens of two independent HNSCC patient cohorts. Low SOX2 expression was found in 19.3% and 44.9% of primary tumor specimens, respectively. Univariate analysis demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between low SOX2 protein levels and reduced progression-free survival (Cohort I 51 vs. 16 months; Cohort II 33 vs. 12 months) and overall survival (Cohort I 150 vs. 37 months; Cohort II 33 vs. 16 months). Multivariate Cox proportional hazard model analysis confirmed that low SOX2 expression serves as an independent prognostic marker for HNSCC patients. We conclude that SOX2 inhibits tumor cell motility in HNSCC cells and that low SOX2 expression serves as a prognosticator to identify HNSCC patients at high risk for treatment failure.', 20604800: StringElement('Probiotics are perceived to exert beneficial effects in the prevention and treatment of allergic diseases.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'BACKGROUND', u'Label': u'BACKGROUND'}), 19185538: StringElement('Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) causes systemic hypertension.

They were monitored from the time of seroconversion for a period of 6 to 12 years until the development of advanced disease in seven men. Based on the analysis of viral divergence from the founder strain, viral population diversity within sequential time points, and the outgrowth of viruses capable of utilizing the CXCR4 receptor (X4 viruses), the existence of three distinct phases within the asymptomatic interval is suggested: an early phase of variable duration during which linear increases ( approximately 1% per year) in both divergence and diversity were observed; an intermediate phase lasting an average of 1.8 years, characterized by a continued increase in divergence but with stabilization or decline in diversity; and a late phase characterized by a slowdown or stabilization of divergence and continued stability or decline in diversity. X4 variants emerged around the time of the early- to intermediate-phase transition and then achieved peak representation and began a decline around the transition between the intermediate and late phases. The late-phase transition was also associated with failure of T-cell homeostasis (defined by a downward inflection in CD3(+) T cells) and decline of CD4(+) T cells to </=200 cells/microliter. The strength of these temporal associations between viral divergence and diversity, viral coreceptor specificity, and T-cell homeostasis and subset composition supports the concept that the phases described represent a consistent pattern of viral evolution during the course of HIV-1 infection in moderate progressors. Recognition of this pattern may help explain previous conflicting data on the relationship between viral evolution and disease progression and may provide a useful framework for evaluating immune damage and recovery in untreated and treated HIV-1 infections.', 11966345: StringElement('Serum cholesterol is one of the most important modifiable risk factors for coronary artery disease.

Well-known technical difficulties including the limited access to orbital tissues from patients with active and early disease, lack of an animal model and poor reproducibility of some of the immunological techniques used are in part responsible for this confusing situation. Despite this there is considerable evidence for eye muscle (EM) tissue involvement in the autoimmune reactions of TAO. Although the primary EM antigen(s) recognized by immunocompetent cells and autoantibodies has not been definitely identified, some good candidates, among them a membrane antigen of 64 kD which is also expressed in the thyroid, have been partially characterized. While it is unclear which component of the autoimmune reaction against EM-humoral or cell mediated-plays the more important role, autoantibodies seem to be responsible at least in part for the clinical features of the eye disorder. On the other hand, the orbital connective tissue (OCT) cells, especially the fibroblasts surrounding the EM fibers, seem to be extremely sensitive to stimulation by cytokines and other soluble proteins and immunoglobulins released in the course of an immune reaction in the muscle cells. Fibroblasts secrete large amounts of glycosaminoglycans and also participate in maintaining the autoimmune reaction. It seems likely that the EM is the main and primary target of the orbital autoimmune process whereas inflammation of the OCT is probably secondary.', 19550095: 'There are conflicting data regarding the role of interleukin (IL)-17 in periodontal health and disease.

The sampling device for collection should include the smallest area of skin possible and the use of Zn-containing baby creams has to be avoided both during the collection and at least 24 hours prior to urine collection.

Whilst Ca(2+) influx through voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels on the plasma membrane is a key trigger for glucose-stimulated secretion, mobilisation of Ca(2+) from acidic stores has been implicated in the control of more localised Ca(2+) changes and membrane potential. Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), generated in \\u03b2-cells in response to high glucose, is a potent mobiliser of these stores, and has been proposed to act through two pore channels (TPC1 and TPC2, murine gene names Tpcn1 and Tpcn2). Whilst the role of TPC1 in the control of Ca(2+) mobilisation and insulin secretion was recently confirmed, conflicting data exist for TPC2. Here, we used the selective and efficient deleter strain, Ins1Cre to achieve \\u03b2-cell selective deletion of the Tpcn2 gene in mice. \\u03b2Tpcn2 KO mice displayed normal intraperitoneal and oral glucose tolerance, and glucose-stimulated Ca(2+) dynamics and insulin secretion from islets were similarly normal. GLP-1-induced Ca(2+) increases involved an increase in oscillation frequency from 4.35 to 4.84 per minute (p=0.04) at 8mM glucose, and this increase was unaffected by the absence of Tpcn2. The current data thus indicate that TPC2 is not absolutely required for normal glucose- or incretin-stimulated insulin secretion from the \\u03b2-cell.

In oncology, their role in metastatic bone disease is well established, but there is increasing interest in their potential role in preventing and treating cancer-induced bone loss and their possible anti-tumour effects. Metastatic bone disease is associated with a variety of skeletal complications, including pathologic fractures, bone pain, impaired mobility, spinal cord compression and hypercalcaemia. Intravenous bisphosphonates, particularly zoledronic acid, in conjunction with rehydration, are now established as the treatment of choice for hypercalcaemia. For treatment of bone pain, it has also been shown that bisphosphonates can be an effective supplementary approach to radiotherapy. In breast cancer and myeloma, bisphosphonates have now become part of standard therapy to treat and prevent skeletal-related events (SRE) and, until recently, treatment was largely with intravenous pamidronate or oral clodronate. However, large, randomised, multicentre trials using intravenous administration of the highly potent bisphosphonate zoledronic acid every 3-4 weeks have recently demonstrated a reduction of 20% in the risk of developing an SRE compared with pamidronate for patients with breast cancer. Moreover, these trials have demonstrated, for the first time, that a bisphosphonate significantly reduces the occurrence of skeletal events in hormone-refractory prostate cancer and in non-small cell lung cancer and a range of other solid tumours. Investigations into the potential of the relatively low potency bisphosphonate, clodronate, for the prevention of bone metastases in breast cancer have produced conflicting data. Further large, randomised studies with clodronate and zoledronic acid are planned and until the results are available it is not possible to identify a definite adjuvant role for bisphosphonates. Evidence is accumulating in vitro that bisphosphonates are also able to directly affect tumour cells, in addition to their effects on osteoclasts, with zoledronic acid being particularly potent. Over recent decades there has been a significant improvement in cure rates and survival times in certain cancers and the use of chemotherapy and hormone therapy has expanded greatly, leading to increasing numbers of long-term survivors who have received these treatments. Management of treatment-induced bone loss is therefore assuming a greater importance and bisphosphonates represent an attractive treatment option in such patients. Several placebo-controlled trials using oral clodronate, oral risedronate, intravenous pamidronate and intravenous zoledronic acid have all now demonstrated benefits in reducing the loss in bone mineral density.', 26394533: 'Multiple myeloma (MM) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) are common hematological malignancies.

Ten patients had 1-13 abnormal oropharyngeal pH events as measured by Dx-pH monitoring with a total of 48 events. The median pH of reflux events had a statistically significant increase from 3.1 at the distal esophageal probe to 5.2 at the pharynx and 5.6 at the oropharynx, the latter being 80% higher than the distal esophageal probe (P<0.001). The percentage of acid events decreased in a cephalad manner from 66.7% at distal esophagus to 25% at the pharynx and only 6.25% at the oropharyngeal Dx-pH Probe, with the remaining events being weakly acidic. Dx-pH Probe is a new sensitive oropharyngeal pH device whose values correlate well with the gold-standard 24-hour pH device, and appears to accurately detect pH events that begin at the distal esophagus and travel upward to the oropharynx. This device suggests that supraesophageal events manifest themselves as rapid pH drops (>10%), which are likely not to be identified using the standard criteria of pH <4 due to the gradient of increasing pH from the lower esophagus to the oropharynx.', 20329799: 'The relevance of the melanocortin system to sexual activity is well established, and nonselective peptide agonists of the melanocortin receptors have shown evidence of efficacy in human sexual dysfunction. The role of the MC4 receptor subtype has received particular scrutiny, but the sufficiency of its selective activation in potentiating sexual response has remained uncertain owing to conflicting data from studies in preclinical species. We describe here the discovery of a novel series of small-molecule MC4 receptor agonists derived from library hit 2. The addition of methyl substituents at C3 and C5 of the 4-phenylpiperidin-4-ol ring was found to be markedly potency-enhancing, enabling the combination of low nanomolar potencies with full rule-of-five compliance. In general, the series shows only micromolar activity at other melanocortin receptors. Our preferred compound 40a provided significant systemic exposure in humans on both sublingual and oral administration and was safe and well tolerated up to the maximum tested dose.

Numerous studies have shown that there is high level of concordance between the HER2/neu status of the primary breast cancer and the metastases of a given patient. Recently, changes in HER2/neu status with tumor progression have been reported, suggesting the possibility of an emerging different tumor clone. Little is known about intratumoral heterogeneity with regard to HER2/neu oncoprotein overexpression. We identified nine cases of invasive ductal carcinoma that showed intratumoral variation in HER2/neu oncoprotein expression by immunohistochemistry. This was confirmed by the intratumoral variation in the amplification status of the HER2/neu gene by fluorescence in situ hybridization and by chromogenic in situ hybridization. The results of this study suggest that some cases of primary breast carcinoma are heterogeneous in regard to HER2/neu gene amplification or protein overexpression. Heterogeneity of HER2/neu status in a tumor may be a rare event or underestimated. This phenomenon should be examined as it may contribute to a better understanding of the variation in therapeutic responses and the conflicting data in studies about the prognostic and predictive role of HER2/neu status in subsets of breast cancer patients.', 23361453: StringElement('There are conflicting data regarding the significance of the presence of the male prepuce or circumcision on erectile function and sexual satisfaction in men.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'BACKGROUND', u'Label': u'BACKGROUND'}), 19210158: StringElement('Atherosclerosis is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and cardiovascular disease (CVD) represents a major cause of death.

There are limited and conflicting data on the cardiovascular changes in this model. The aim of the present study was to characterize the cardiovascular and autonomic phenotype of male db/db mice and evaluate the role of angiotensin II AT(1) receptors. Radiotelemetry was used to monitor 24 h blood pressure (BP) in mice for 8 weeks. Parameters measured were mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) and their variabilities. In 8-week-old db/db mice, the MAP and BP circadian rhythms were not different from age-matched control mice, while HR and locomotor activity were decreased. With ageing, MAP gradually increased in db/db mice, and the 12 h light values did not dip significantly from the 12 h dark periods. In 14-week-old mice, MAP was increased during light (101 +/- 1 versus 117 +/- 2 mmHg, P < 0.01; control versus db/db mice) and dark phases (110 +/- 1.7 versus 121 +/- 3.1 mmHg, P < 0.01; control versus db/db mice). This increase in MAP was associated with a significant increase in plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and angiotensin II levels. Chronic treatment with losartan (10 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) blocked the increase in MAP in db/db mice, with no effect in control animals. Spectral analysis was used to monitor autonomic cardiovascular function. The circadian rhythm observed in systolic arterial pressure variance and its low-frequency component in control mice was absent in db/db mice. There were no changes in HR variability and spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity between control and db/db mice.

There are conflicting data on the ligand affinity of hybrids, and especially on the influence of different IR isoforms. To investigate further the contribution of individual ligand binding epitopes to affinity and specificity in the IR/IGFR family, we generated hybrids incorporating both IR isoforms (A and B) and IR/IGFR domain-swap chimaeras, by ectopic co-expression of receptor constructs in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and studied ligand binding using both radioligand competition and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer assays. We found that IR-A-IGFR and IR-B-IGFR hybrids bound insulin with similar relatively low affinity, which was intermediate between that of homodimeric IR and homodimeric IGFR. However, both IR-A-IGFR and IR-B-IGFR hybrids bound IGF-I and IGF-II with high affinity, at a level comparable with homodimeric IGFR. Incorporation of a significant fraction of either IR-A or IR-B into hybrids resulted in abrogation of insulin- but not IGF-I-stimulated autophosphorylation. We conclude that the sequence of 12 amino acids encoded by exon 11 of the IR gene has little or no effect on ligand binding and activation of IR-IGFR hybrids, and that hybrid receptors bind IGFs but not insulin at physiological concentrations regardless of the IR isoform they contained. To reconstitute high affinity insulin binding within a hybrid receptor, chimaeras in which the IGFR L1 or L2 domains had been replaced by equivalent IR domains were co-expressed with full-length IR-A or IR-B. In the context of an IR-A-IGFR hybrid, replacement of IR residues 325-524 (containing the L2 domain and part of the first fibronectin domain) with the corresponding IGFR sequence increased the affinity for insulin by 20-fold. We conclude that the L2 and/or first fibronectin domains of IR contribute in trans with the L1 domain to create a high affinity insulin-binding site within a dimeric receptor.', 12697588: StringElement('Exhaled nitric oxide (NO) may reflect NO production and consumption but the pulmonary origin of NO in exhaled gas is not clear.

In the present paper these measurements were extended to include acoustic measurements concerning the functional role of the mouth cavity in frog hearing. Based on these measurements a model of the frog's acoustic periphery, consisting of three coupled linear oscillators with three entrance ports for sound, was developed and analyzed mathematically to give the various relevant transfer functions. The model is characterized by six parameters, all of which could be estimated from the available experimental data. For frequencies up to some 1500 Hz the model adequately describes the experimental data, both our own and earlier, seemingly conflicting data in the literature. For higher frequencies deviations occur, possibly due to nonuniform vibrations of the membranes. The model was used to evaluate the monaural directional sensitivity of the frog under free-field stimulation. Essentially it behaves as a combined pressure-gradient receiver, with highly frequency-dependent directional sensitivity. Directional sensitivity of the tympanic membrane could be modulated drastically by changing the resonance properties of the mouth cavity, without affecting the intrinsic membrane properties. This, theoretically, allows the frog to manipulate its direction sensitivity by actively tuning the volume of its mouth cavity. In order to account for discrepancies with known properties of low-frequency auditory nerve fibers an additional, extra-tympanic channel was included into the model. The extended model, the second-channel possibly involving the opercularis complex, provides a good quantitative fit to the available data on tympanic membrane movement as well as auditory nerve activity. Finally, the model enables to simulate a (moving) sound source in space, while stimulating the frog via closed couplers.\", 12394429: StringElement('Evidence from rodent intestinal tumorigenesis models suggests that both cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 may play important roles in the development and progression of human sporadic colorectal adenomas.

Although the association of KSHV with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), and multicentric Castleman's disease has been well established, its presence in some other diseases, such as multiple myeloma, remains controversial. Because most KSHV studies are based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, the conflicting data may be attributable to variations in the methods, primer sets, and target sequences selected. To establish an efficient and reliable PCR approach for KSHV detection we designed eight sets of primers to six regions (ORFK1, ORFK2, ORFK9, ORK26, ORF72, and ORF74) of the KSHV genome using appropriate database and software. The detection sensitivity of these primers was carefully assessed and their reliability was strictly validated in a series of positive (15 KS and PEL samples) and negative (16 lymphoid tissues) controls. We found that primer sets to the ORFK9 region showed the highest sensitivity, whereas primer sets to ORFK1 and ORF74 showed the lowest sensitivity. Primer sets to ORFK9, ORF26 and ORF72 regions detected all of the positive cases, whereas other primer sets showed varying detection rates or nonspecific bands. All 16 negative controls were negative with all primer sets. However, six of 16 negative controls became positive when we used nested PCR targeting ORF26. Therefore, multiple target KSHV sequences increase the detection efficiency, while nested PCR protocols are likely to introduce false positivity. Using ORFK9, ORF26 and ORF72 primer sets, we screened bone marrow biopsies from 18 cases of multiple myeloma, and failed to detect any KSHV sequences. This finding supports the conclusion that KSHV is not associated with multiple myeloma. Indeed, our results further confirm that although KSHV is universally present in Kaposi's sarcoma and primary effusion lymphoma, it is not ubiquitious.\", 22837920: StringElement('Studies on the human interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) gene polymorphism have provided conflicting data regarding the bone mass and quality.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'BACKGROUND', u'Label': u'CONTEXT'}), 14530498: \"Should interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) be considered the standard of care for the adjuvant therapy of high-risk malignant melanoma? For 2003, it was estimated that 51,400 cases of invasive melanoma would be diagnosed. The risk of recurrence after surgery is reported to be approximately 60% for patients with thick primary lesions (T4N0M0, American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] stage IIB) and 75% for patients with regional nodal metastases (T1-4N1M0, AJCC stage III). The observation that melanoma is susceptible to attack by the host's immune system has resulted in the testing of a remarkably broad spectrum of immunotherapies in the adjuvant setting. Many of these approaches failed to demonstrate a significant clinical impact, until the use of adjuvant IFN-alpha. Conflicting data from several large, randomized clinical trials resulted in a rapid rise and then decline in the use of IFN-alpha in the adjuvant setting.

Also, evidence has been accumulated that an immune response gene associated to the DR3 region may be a denominator for the development of an endocrine autoimmunity. It is particularly the late onset type I diabetes that belongs to the so-called \"primary\" autoimmune variety and also shows an increased tendency for the development of other autoimmune disorders. HLA DR 3 and/or HLA DR 4 associated mechanisms seem to influence a variety of clinical and immunologic findings in type I diabetes. Basically, this concept is supported by findings on seasonal variations in diabetes manifestation, on viral antibodies, on anti-insulin antibody formation, and on the natural course of endogenous insulin secretion in relation to HLA haptotypes . There are, however, conflicting data concerning islet cell antibodies, circulating immune complexes, and the incidence of diabetic microangiopathy in relation to the HLA-system.

The Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes), a well characterized small fish model, is being used increasingly for carcinogenicity testing because of its low cost, ease of maintenance and carcinogen sensitivity. In this study, 6-week-old medaka were exposed to diethylnitrosamine (DEN, a known initiator), followed by continuous exposure to 0.5 or 2.0 g/l DCA in the ambient water, over a 4 week period. At both exposure concentrations, changes in the liver included marked hepatocellular cytoplasmic vacuolation, cytomegaly, karyomegaly, nuclear atypia and multifocal areas of hepatocellular necrosis and loss as early as week two of DCA exposure. The majority of the hepatocellular cytoplasmic vacuoles were shown by periodic acid Schiff (PAS) staining to contain large amounts of glycogen. These elevated glycogen levels may reflect a disruption in the enzyme pathways for glycolysis. The total cellular changes seen in this short-term exposure regimen are compatible with preneoplastic changes seen in rats and mice exposed to DCA. The results of this study strengthen the role of the Japanese medaka as a suitable species in carcinogenicity testing as well as its implementation in the risk assessment process for DCA across several phyletic levels.', 14610381: 'Although the benefits of thrombolytic therapy are well established in patients younger than age 75 years with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction, the value of thrombolytic treatment in patients 75 years of age or older remains controversial.

However, in a recent meta-analysis based on data from 3322 patients aged 75 years or older presenting with ST-elevation myocardial infarction within 6 hours of symptom onset, thrombolytic therapy was associated with an absolute mortality reduction of 3.4% (26.0% vs. 29.4%), an effect similar to that seen in younger patients. In addition, although the risk of stroke increased with age, the absolute excess risk of stroke in patients older than age 75 years receiving thrombolytic treatment was <1%, and there was no age-associated excess in the risk of other major bleeding complications.

These p21/cyclin D1/Cdk2 complexes are active and also bind the trimeric PCNA complex, with each trimer capable of independently binding distinct cyclin/Cdk complexes.

Do these results vary based on early active postoperative cervical motion? Methods\\u2003A systematic review of the English-language literature was undertaken for articles published between 1970 and August 17, 2012. Electronic databases and reference lists of key articles were searched to identify studies evaluating C2/C3- or C7-preserving cervical laminoplasty for the treatment of cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) or OPLL in adults. Studies involving traumatic onset, cervical fracture, infection, deformity, or neoplasms were excluded, as were noncomparative studies. Two independent reviewers assessed the level of evidence quality using the grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) system, and disagreements were resolved by consensus. Results\\u2003We identified 11 articles meeting our inclusion criteria. Only the randomized controlled trial (RCT) showed no significant difference in late axial pain (at 12 months) when C7 spinous muscle preservation was compared with no preservation. However, seven other retrospective cohort studies showed significant pain relief in the preserved group compared with the nonpreserved group. The preservation group included those with preservation of the C7 spinous process and/or attached muscles, the deep extensor muscles, or C2 muscle attachment and/or C3 laminectomy (as opposed to laminoplasty). One study that included preservation of either the C2 or C7 posterior paraspinal muscles found that only preservation of the muscles attached to C2 resulted in reduced postoperative pain. Another study that included preservation of either the C7 spinous process or the deep extensor muscles found that only preservation of C7 resulted in reduced postoperative pain. Conclusion\\u2003Although there is conflicting data regarding the importance of preserving C7 and/or the semispinalis cervicis muscle attachments to C2, there is enough evidence to suggest that surgeons should make every attempt to preserve these structures whenever possible since there appears to be little downside to doing so, unless it compromises the neurologic decompression.', 7018459: 'Corticosteroids have multiform effects on traffic and functional capabilities of inflammatory or immunologically reactive cells, on various soluble factors, vascular and tissue responses. There is a different sensitivity of various populations and subpopulations of cells to the corticosteroid modulation.

In the minimal change GN the 10 years after onset survival was not significantly increased by introducing corticosteroids, but the prompt disappearance of proteinuria (80% of adults by 8 weeks in our own series) supported their use. The problem of corticosteroid treatment in the focal sclerosing GN is complicated by the probable coexistence of two histologically undistinguishable forms (one of the these nonsteroid sensitive). In our own series the corticosteroid response, although transient, was present in 44% of 16 patients. We obtained a high number of total remissions (57%) and partial remissions (14%), in membranous GN, where the conflicting data of the literature suggest differences in the criteria of selection and admission of patients to corticosteroid treatment, calling attention to further controlled trials.

In people with diabetes, insulin deficiency and hyperglycaemia seem to play a role in determining bone formation alteration by advanced glycation end product (AGE) accumulation or AGE/RAGE (receptors for AGE) axis imbalance, which directly influence osteoblast activity. Moreover, hyperglycaemia and oxidative stress are able to negatively influence osteocalcin production and the Wnt signalling pathways with an imbalance of osteoblast/osteoclast activity leading to bone quality reduction as global effect. In addition, other factors such as insulin growth factors and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\\u03b3 pathways seem to have an important role in the pathophysiology of osteoporosis in diabetes.

In the following study we have generated a novel GRalpha-specific antibody (AShGR) in order to assess, unambiguously, the subcellular distribution of GRalpha. AShGR recognizes recombinant GRalpha on Western blots and in immunoprecipitation experiments but does not cross-react with recombinant GRbeta. Endogenous GRalpha is detected by AShGR in a variety of human cell lines including HeLa S3, CEM-C7, HEK-293, MCF-7, Hep G2, and secondary lung epithelial cells. In addition, AShGR detects endogenous rat and mouse GRalpha. Immunocytochemistry was performed with AShGR on COS-I cells transfected with human GRalpha and on HTC rat hepatoma cells expressing endogenous GRalpha. In both systems, GRalpha was found in the cytoplasm of cells in the absence of hormone and in the nucleus after hormone treatment. These studies mark the first time a GRalpha-specific antibody has been employed to examine the expression and subcellular distribution of endogenous GRalpha.', 1112052: 'A technique is described for using radiolabeled RNA complementary to human DNA as a probe for the specific identification of submicrogram concentrations of human DNA by formation of RNA-DNA hybrids. An example is given of its application to the semiquantitation of human DNA in human plasma, a substance that is ordinarily difficult to examine because materials are present that interfere with the usual colorimetric or fluorometric assays. An example is also given of the use of an analogous approach to analyzing rabbit serum for circulating bacterial DNA. Unique to the hybridization technique is a degree of specificity sufficient to identify specific base sequences and hence the origin of the DNA being detected, a point that may be important in the examination of circulating DNA reported to occur in patients with systemic lupus erythematosis. This technique may also be of value in clarifying the presently conflicting data regarding the occurrence of free DNA in the normal human circulation.', 10846197: StringElement('Preference weighted measures of health related quality of life are necessary for cost effectiveness calculations involving quality of life adjustment.

Publications on PAPP-A, primarily from the last 4-5 years, were reviewed extensively. A special emphasis was placed on those that address the development of methods for the detection of PAPP-A in human serum/plasma and those that study the diagnostic/prognostic accuracy of PAPP-A in patients with acute coronary syndrome. This review shall focus on the possible mechanism of action of PAPP-A, clinical studies involving PAPP-A, PAPP-A assays and its molecular structure. All clinical studies to date related to the diagnostic/prognostic accuracy of PAPP-A (a total of eight studies) were included. They suggest that elevations in PAPP-A correlate with higher risk for the development of cardiovascular adverse events. However, there are conflicting data as to whether PAPP-A levels correlate with cardiac troponins or C-reactive protein. Thus, there is room for speculation as to whether PAPP-A is involved in inflammatory processes, and as to what its role is in plaque rupture and subsequent cardiac ischemic events. Furthermore, new insights into the molecular structure of PAPP-A could aid in the development of more specific assays that may help unravel the clinical utility of PAPP-A.', 25260023: StringElement('The survival rate of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients carrying wild-type KRAS is significantly increased by combining anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (mAb) with standard chemotherapy.
