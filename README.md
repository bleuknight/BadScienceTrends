# BadScienceTrends
## The purpose of this project is to evaluate trends that we hypothesize will lead to conflicts in biomedical research. We created a list of plausible query terms (see queryTerms.csv) and searched pubmed with these terms along with the overarching themes: "conflicting data" "conflicting reports" "retracted" "unjustified" "contradictory data" "contradicting reports"

### Results of these queries are the abstracts of the resulting PMIDs that you see in text files, and the numerical data that is stored in csv files.
