      "{811010: '1. At high humidities up to 98%, an increase in bacteria cannot be detected. This applies to all HEPA filters investigated from the various manufacturers, independent of whether they are hydrophilic or hydrophobic, used or unused. 2. Fungal growth can only be obtained when large amounts of nutrient material (e.g. bacterial cultures) are present. In these cases a streaky growth appears . Under normal conditions of use, however, such intense contamination is not to be expected because of the prefiltration. Penetration only occurs with fungi. 3. Limitation of supply air humidity to 90% or less seems therefore to be unjustified on the basis of these investigations, if prefiltration and a satisfactory intermixing section can be guaranteed technically, and condensation is avoided. 4. HEPA filters of Grade S from various manufacturers and with different behaviour with respect to water do not allow bacterial growth even in the presence of nutrients. Additional measures for the killing of bacteria are therefore not considered necessary.', 10311339: \"Physicians' claims that extensive Medicare and Medicaid fee discounting imposes an inequitable burden on them are examined using survey data from the Health Care Financing Administration on 5,000 primary care physicians. A definite fee hierarchy is documented, with the physician's usual charge at the top and Medicare and Medicaid allowables at the bottom. Under usual, customary, and reasonable methods, physicians can use fees to maximize payment, and insurer attempts to control fees result in both sides participating in a revenue maximization-expenditure control game. Raising Medicare and Medicaid allowables to the physician's usual fee is shown to result in large windfall gains that are unnecessary and unjustified in terms of work effort, human capital investment, or eliciting an adequate supply of practitioners.\", 12601348: 'Better knowledge of the risk factors associated with the appearance of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) could improve the efficacy of surveillance programs. A total of 463 patients aged 40 to 65 years with liver cirrhosis in Child-Pugh class A or B were included in a program of early diagnosis. The predictive value of different risk factors was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression model. Thirty-eight patients developed HCC. In the multivariate analysis, 4 variables showed an independent predictive value for the development of HCC: age 55 years or older, antibody to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) positivity, prothrombin activity 75% or less, and platelet count less than 75 x 10(3)/mm(3). According to the contribution of each of these factors to the final model, a score ranging between 0 and 4.71 points was constructed to allow the division of patients into 2 different risk groups. The low-risk group included those with a score of 2.33 points or less (n = 270; 4 with HCC; cumulative incidence of HCC at 4 years, 2.3%), and the high-risk group included those with a score greater than 2.33 (n = 193; 34 with HCC; cumulative incidence of HCC at 4 years, 30.1%) (P =.0001). In conclusion, a simple score made up of 4 clinical and biological variables allowed us to distinguish 2 groups of cirrhotic patients at high and low risk for the development of HCC. We believe this score can be useful in establishing a subset of cirrhotic patients in whom a surveillance program for early detection of HCC could be unjustified.', 20103174: 'Asymptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) is common, may adversely affect quality of life, and above all can be as serious as symptomatic AF. The prevalence of AF reported in epidemiological studies is significantly underestimated, as asymptomatic AF is often not known about. The efficacy of pharmacological or non-pharmacological treatment is often overestimated if the only aim considered is symptomatic recurrences. Like symptomatic AF, asymptomatic AF justifies anticoagulation, depending on the risk of embolism. Estimating the risk of embolism only from symptomatic episodes may result in unjustified discontinuation of antithrombotic treatment. Finally, frequent asymptomatic episodes may worsen atrial or even ventricular remodelling and result in tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.', 26892973: 'The terms health, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and quality of life (QoL) are used interchangeably. Given that these are three key terms in the literature, their appropriate and clear use is important. This paper reviews the history and definitions of the terms and considers how they have been used. It is argued that the definitions of HRQoL in the literature are problematic because some definitions fail to distinguish between HRQoL and health or between HRQoL and QoL. Many so-called HRQoL questionnaires actually measure self-perceived health status and the use of the phrase QoL is unjustified. It is concluded that the concept of HRQoL as used now is confusing. A potential solution is to define HRQoL as the way health is empirically estimated to affect QoL or use the term to only signify the utility associated with a health state.', 12027921: \"Gestational diabetes is carbohydrate intolerance, with onset or first recognition of hyperglycaemia during pregnancy. Several studies have suggested that gestational hyperglycaemia is associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, promoting the case for screening. Conversely, others argue that screening for gestational diabetes may colour the clinical judgement, influencing further management, e.g. more 'unjustified' caesarean sections. Additionally, the lack of definitive data either on a clear-cut glycaemic threshold for the development of adverse outcomes or on the impact of intervention is emphasized by opponents of screening. This review attempts to evaluate the available data on screening for gestational diabetes. Oral glucose tolerance test is promoted on the basis that the diabetogenic stress of pregnancy is encountered during late gestation and is best recognized in the fed state. There are different tests, including the 1 h/50-g, 2 h/75-g and 3 h/100-g tests, with practical limitations, including the time and cost involved and the unpleasant supra-physiological glucose load that is unrelated to body weight, and issues of reproducibility and sensitivity/specificity profiles. Despite its convenience, the poor sensitivity of random glucose has precluded its routine use for screening. Fasting glucose appears to be promising but further testing is required to ensure satisfactory sensitivity/specificity in different populations. Despite its limitations, the oral glucose tolerance test has become established as the 'most acceptable' diagnostic test for gestational diabetes. More convenient methods, e.g. fasting or random or post-load glucose, have to be validated therefore against the oral glucose tolerance test to gain acceptance for routine screening.\", 19793941: 'Reports in the popular press suggest that smart drugs or \"nootropics\" such as methylphenidate, modafinil and piracetam are increasingly being used by the healthy to augment cognitive ability. Although current nootropics offer only modest improvements in cognitive performance, it appears likely that more effective compounds will be developed in the future and that their off-label use will increase. One sphere in which the use of these drugs may be commonplace is by healthy students within academia. This article reviews the ethical and pragmatic implications of nootropic use in academia by drawing parallels with issues relevant to the drugs in sport debate. It is often argued that performance-enhancing drugs should be prohibited because they create an uneven playing field. However, this appears dubious given that \"unfair\" advantages are already ubiquitous and generally tolerated by society. There are concerns that widespread use will indirectly coerce non-users also to employ nootropics in order to remain competitive. However, to restrict the autonomy of all people for fear that it may influence the actions of some is untenable. The use of potentially harmful drugs for the purposes of enhancement rather than treatment is often seen as unjustified, and libertarian approaches generally champion the rights of the individual in deciding if these risks are acceptable. Finally, whether the prohibition of nootropics can be effectively enforced is doubtful. As nootropics use becomes widespread among students in the future, discussion of this issue will become more pressing in the years to come.', 22519830: StringElement('Erythrocytapheresis (ECP), automated red blood cell exchange, is increasingly being used for chronic transfusion therapy in sickle cell disease (SCD) as it is an isovolumetric transfusion, is more effective in lowering hemoglobin (Hb)S, and can limit iron overload.

How can the notion of time gaining value toward the end of life be incorporated into conventional cost-benefit analyses? A standard QALY (Quality Adjusted Life Years) is the product of quality of life and time, without adjusting for any change in the value of time.

The absence of diagnostic specificity induces many false positive findings in healthy subjects. As a result unjustified diets might limit quality of life and lead to malnutrition.

Radiotherapy can also be used instead of surgery to reach an identical satisfactory result; i.e. locoregional control of the cancer and an aesthetic result of satisfactory quality. Actually, when the alternative offers a real benefit for the patient, radiotherapy alone should be entertained, particularly for tumours classically treated by primary mastectomy (T > 3 cm). For a long time, it was difficult to achieve both efficacity and good tolerance with radiotherapy. In addition, one could not be certain that survival rates were the same for conservative and radical treatments. But since then, randomized and non-randomized comparisons have shown that the conservative or radical nature of the treatment has no effect on survival. Radiotherapy is now better tolerated due to lower total doses which were sometimes too high due to the unjustified reputation of radioresistance. Radiotherapy is thus an alternative to surgery in operable cases, offering conservative treatment and the possibility of delayed surgery if needed. Thus one cannot speak of treatment without surgery since an operation is programmed if required. The treatment can also begin with routine axillary dissection both as a therapeutic and diagnostic procedure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)', 11172533: 'Research utilizing animal models has been responsible for major advances in understanding psychiatric disorders. The first data based integrative theories of psychopathology grew largely out of animal research. A variety of animal models that have been developed have been critical in broadening our understanding of human development and in providing empirical support for the importance of early experiences for behavioral and neurobiologic development. The development of many widely used clinical psychopharmacologic agents has depended on the use of animal models. The above examples represent substantive contributions of animal models to investigations of fundamental aspects of psychopathology. There is no \"perfect,\" complete or comprehensive single animal model for any specific psychiatric disorder and contentious debates about the validity and/or usefulness of specific animal models persist. Animal models of diseases in medicine need to be understood in a historical and evolutionary perspective and their advantages as well as limitations recognized. There will likely never be an animal model in any field of medicine that is a perfect fit with the human condition, rather the emphasis in the development and study of disease models in animals needs to be on specific components of the human illness. Neither overextended cross-species comparisons nor unjustified negativism about animal models seems defensible. A major challenge in the continuing development and use of biobehavioral animal models in psychiatry is their relationship to the molecular neurosciences, including genetics, in understanding the mechanisms of mental disorders.', 10827847: \"Reproductive cloning in adults/children evokes unfavourable reactions.

The ethical analysis of reproductive cloning of embryos depends on the purposes and applications.

However, it does not provide quantitative estimation of the relative efficiency of formation of contacts revealed by this method, and when interpreting the data this does not allow taking into account the relative contribution of some specific and nonspecific interactions to the total affinity of nucleic acids (NA) to enzymes. This often results in unjustified overestimation of the role of specific enzyme--NA contacts in affinity and specificity of enzyme action. In recent years we have developed new approaches to analysis of the mechanisms of protein--nucleic acid interactions allowing quantitative estimation of the relative contribution of virtually every nucleotide unit (including individual structural elements) to the total affinity of enzymes to long DNA and RNA molecules. It is shown that the interaction between enzymes and NA on the molecular level can be successfully analyzed by the methods of synthesis and analysis, that is, step-by-step simplification or complication of the structure of a long NA-ligand. This approach allows the demonstration that complex formation including formation of contacts between enzymes and specific NA units can provide neither high affinity of the enzymes to NA nor the specificity of their action. Using a number of sequence-independent replication and repair enzymes specifically recognizing a modified unit in DNA and also some sequence-dependent topoisomerization and restriction enzymes as examples, it was shown that virtually all nucleotide units within the DNA binding cleft interact with the enzyme, and high affinity mainly (up to 5-7 of 7-10 orders of magnitude) is provided by many weak additive interactions between these enzymes and various structural elements of the individual NA nucleotide units. At the same time, the relative contribution of specific interactions to the total affinity of NA is rather small and does not exceed 1-2 orders of magnitude. Specificity of enzyme action is provided by the stages of the enzyme-dependent NA adaptation to the optimal conformation and directly of catalysis: kcat increases by 3-7 orders of magnitude when changing from nonspecific to specific NA. In the present work we summarized our experience in studies of enzymes by the method of step-by-step complication of the ligand structure and performed a detailed analysis of the features of this approach and its possibilities for the study of protein--nucleic acid interactions on the molecular level.', 11864175: 'OBJECTIVE: To analyse the quality of ordering, collection and transport of specimens for microbiological analysis by a department of orthopedic surgery.

Because nucleic acid amplification is exquisitely sensitive, theoretically capable of detecting as little as a single gene copy, and highly specific, it offers the opportunity to use noninvasive sampling (ie, urine). This ability in turn means that these tests might be used in nontraditional settings, such as schools and in the field, which may be very helpful in providing services to homeless adolescents. However, none of these tests is approved or recommended by the manufacturers for rectal specimens from adults, and they are not approved for rectogenital specimens from children. In addition to medical implications, the identification of a sexually transmitted disease (STD), especially in a young child, also has legal implications. Because of the legal implications, the highest specificity is needed and is more important than is sensitivity in this situation.

A recent article by Moore et al. (MEA) reported a number of theoretical and practical concerns with BAMM. Major claims from MEA are that (i) BAMM\\'s likelihood function is incorrect, because it does not account for unobserved rate shifts; (ii) the posterior distribution on the number of rate shifts is overly sensitive to the prior; and (iii) diversification rate estimates from BAMM are unreliable. Here, we show that these and other conclusions from MEA are generally incorrect or unjustified. We first demonstrate that MEA\\'s numerical assessment of the BAMM likelihood is compromised by their use of an invalid likelihood function. We then show that \"unobserved rate shifts\" appear to be irrelevant for biologically plausible parameterizations of the diversification process. We find that the purportedly extreme prior sensitivity reported by MEA cannot be replicated with standard usage of BAMM v2.5, or with any other version when conventional Bayesian model selection is performed. Finally, we demonstrate that BAMM performs very well at estimating diversification rate variation across the ${\\\\sim}$20% of simulated trees in MEA\\'s data set for which it is theoretically possible to infer rate shifts with confidence. Due to ascertainment bias, the remaining 80% of their purportedly variable-rate phylogenies are statistically indistinguishable from those produced by a constant-rate birth-death process and were thus poorly suited for the summary statistics used in their performance assessment. We demonstrate that inferences about diversification rates have been accurate and consistent across all major previous releases of the BAMM software. We recognize an acute need to address the theoretical foundations of rate-shift models for phylogenetic trees, and we expect BAMM and other modeling frameworks to improve in response to mathematical and computational innovations.

This by itself would not justify modification of the re quirements, since preservation of the biological integrity of Mars is essential for proper exploration of the planet. However, when the physical and biological assumptions underlying the COSPAR recommendations are com pared with actual conditions on Mars, as established by recent observations, it becomes apparent that the COSPAR as sumptions are unrealistic in important respects. Specifically, the belief that eolian erosion on Mars can effect the release of spores trapped in the interior of solids in periods of time that are short compared with the time scale of the unmanned space program is unsup ported by either observation or theory. On the contrary, the analysis suggests that rates of eolian erosion on Mars are very low. Similarly, present knowledge of the Martian environment opposes the view that terrestrial microorganisms would readily contaminate the planet. The combination of dryness, lack of oxygen, and high ultraviolet flux makes the surface of Mars peculiarly unsuit able for the multiplication of terrestrial organisms. Recent studies give little sup port to the proposal that significant areas of geothermal activity exist on Mars. These various findings suggest that the COSPAR-recommended constraints could be substantially relaxed without compromising to any significant degree the biological condition of Mars. In particular, a distinction needs to be made between microorganisms trapped in solids and those on exposed sur faces of landed spacecraft. Surface sterility is an unconditional require ment, in the sense that it is imposed by considerations unrelated to the nature of the Martian environment. Sterilization of the interior of solids to the extreme level recommended by COSPAR, however, is based on the as sumption that entrapped organisms con stitute a substantial hazard to the ecology of Mars. This assumption now seems unjustified, and the need for a high degree of interior sterility is doubt ful. Current spacecraft-sterilization pol icies should be revised accordingly.', 22567063: StringElement('Many clinical trials have a crossover design.

We dropped this assumption and computed the expected power and expected sample size to evaluate the performance of the procedure under the omniscient model. When there is uncertainty in the HC response rate but this uncertainty is not considered, Makuch and Simon's method produces a sample size that gives a considerably lower power than that specified. Even the larger sample size obtained from the randomized design formula and applied to the HC setting does not guarantee the advertised power in the HC setting. We developed a new uniform power method to search for the sample size required for the experimental group to yield an exact power without relying on the estimated HC response rate being perfectly correct. The new method produces the correct uniform predictive power for all permissible response rates. The resulting sample size is closer to the sample size needed for the randomized design than Makuch and Simon's method, especially when there is a small difference in response rates or a limited sample size in the HC group. HC design may be a viable option in clinical trials when the patient selection bias and the outcome evaluation bias can be minimized. However, the common perception of the extra sample size savings is largely unjustified without the strong assumption that the observed HC response rate is equal to the true control response rate.

While there is a large number of follow-up studies attempting to estimate sensitivity, specificity, or the predictive values of follow-up tests, the methodological aspects of validation are rarely addressed adequately in these publications, and the estimations of validity are often not well-founded. In the first part of this paper we analyze aspects of validity and validation studies. In particular, the following problems are addressed: a) Validity depends on the context; in particular, it depends on the characteristics of the population, the embedding of the test in a diagnostic strategy, the uncertainty of the test itself, the gold standard, and the criterion for positive test results. b) Global, time-independent measures of validity are hardly adequate. In particular, any attempt to incorporate a positive lead-time in the definition of the sensitivity is incompatible with an exhaustive classification matrix and with a meaningful definition of predictive values. c) Published estimations of sensitivity mostly suffer from numerous biases. First, there is work-up bias, which arises if positive and negative test-results are verified in a different way (in fact, this implies the use of two different gold standards). Next, test-review bias may occur unless the determination of the test result and the gold standard are mutually blinded. Finally, in quantitative tests, like tumor markers, there is a risk of resubstitution bias if the sample used for defining the cutoff level is identical to the validation sample. Several practical recommendations are given for designing validation studies. In the second part, problems of the efficacy of follow-up programs in regard to patient survival are discussed. Five necessary conditions must be satisfied in order to make such an effect possible. Taking these aspects into account, it can be shown that the usual arguments advanced in favor of diagnostic monitoring are not stringent. As for the design of studies on the efficacy of cancer surveillance, non-randomized studies are inconclusive given that they suffer from a variety of specific biases. It can be shown that the demand, often found in recent publications, that comparative studies of more versus less intensive monitoring be designed so as to permit the detection of a survival advantage in the subgroup of patients who relapse, is unjustified.

The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and Centre for Health Economics at the University of York were commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article provides a description of the company submission, the ERG review and the resulting NICE guidance TA289 issued in June 2013. The ERG critically reviewed the evidence presented in the manufacturer's submission and identified areas requiring clarification, for which the manufacturer provided additional evidence. The main clinical effectiveness data were derived from two phase III, multicentre, randomised controlled trials (RCTs): Controlled myelofibrosis study with oral JAK inhibitor treatment (COMFORT)-II compared ruxolitinib with best available therapy (BAT), and COMFORT-I compared ruxolitinib with placebo. These RCTs demonstrated that ruxolitinib confers significant benefits in terms of spleen size reduction and improvement in symptom burden. In the COMFORT-II trial, a reduction in spleen volume of \\u226535\\xa0% was achieved in 28\\xa0% of ruxolitinib-treated patients compared with 0\\xa0% of patients in the BAT group (p\\xa0<\\xa00.001) at 48\\xa0weeks, and there was a mean change in spleen volume of -30.1 versus +7.3\\xa0% (p\\xa0<\\xa00.001). Ruxolitinib also provided significant improvements in myelofibrosis-associated symptoms and health-related quality-of-life compared with BAT and placebo. The ERG concluded that ruxolitinib appears to reduce splenomegaly and its associated symptoms, but that there was considerable uncertainty surrounding the manufacturer's cost-effectiveness estimates due to limitations in the manufacturer's model. The manufacturer's model did not allow for disease progression, did not accurately capture symptomatic relief, had several implausible or unjustified assumptions, and there were several parameter choices that the ERG found sub-optimal. ERG sensitivity analyses found that nearly all plausible adjustments to the model reduced the cost effectiveness of ruxolitinib. It is very likely that the base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of \\xa373,980/quality-adjusted life-year presented by the manufacturer represents a best-case scenario. The NICE Appraisal Committee concluded that ruxolitinib was clinically effective, but could not be considered a cost effective use of National Health Service (NHS) resources for treating disease-related splenomegaly or symptoms in adults with myelofibrosis. Ruxolitinib is not recommended for the treatment of disease-related splenomegaly or symptoms in adult patients with primary myelofibrosis (also known as chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis), post-polycythaemia vera myelofibrosis and post-essential thrombocythaemia myelofibrosis in NICE TA289.\", 25352397: 'In 2008, Zwart and colleagues observed that the fraction of the structures deposited in the PDB alleged to have \"pseudosymmetry\" or \"special noncrystallographic symmetry\" (NCS) was about 6%, and that this percentage was rising annually. A few years later, Poon and colleagues found that 2% of all the crystal structures in the PDB belonged to higher symmetry space groups than those assigned to them. Here, I report an analysis of the X-ray diffraction data deposited for this class of structures, which shows that most of the \"pseudosymmetry\" and \"special NCS\" that has been reported is in fact true crystallographic symmetry (CS). This distinction is important because the credibility of crystal structures depends heavily on quality control statistics such as Rfree that are unreliable when they are computed incorrectly, which they often are when CS is misidentified as \"special NCS\" or \"pseudosymmetry\". When mistakes of this kind are made, artificially low values of Rfree can give unjustified confidence in the accuracy of the reported structures.', 15876302: \"We are all aware today of the growing interest in continuing medical education (CME) programmes in many European Countries and it is important to understand why and how CME could become an international reality.

The Universal Definition of MI brought about a shift in the diagnostics of MI, from an approach primarily based on electrocardiography (ECG) to one primarily based on biomarkers. Currently, detection of a rise and/or fall in concentration or activity of myocardial necrosis biomarkers, preferentially cTns, with at least one value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL), is the essential component for the diagnosis of MI. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays with their superior analytical performance were designed to further facilitate clinical decision making. The ability of hs-cTn assays to detect measurable cTn concentrations in at least 50% of healthy individuals, along with their improved precision (expressed as coefficient of variation \\u226410% at the 99th percentile URL) associated with increased recognition of changing values, leads to enhanced risk stratification of patients with suspected MI, and also enables them to be used as prognostic tools potentially useful in other patient subsets. In this comprehensive review, we aim to integrate updated laboratory and clinical knowledge regarding hs-cTn assays in order to promote their optimal use in daily practice. We primarily focus on the role of hs-cTn assays in patients with suspected MI, discussing recommended diagnostic algorithms and result interpretation. Emphasis is also placed on the release of cTns following myocardial injury, the characteristics of antibodies used in available cTn immunoassays, and analytical performance of hs-cTn assays. In this paper, we also review potential challenges related to the selection of a healthy reference population in determining 99th percentile values, biological variation of hs-cTns, inequality between hs-cTn assays, and outline the current status of cTnI standardization. Finally, we discuss in detail the diagnostic and prognostic value of hs-cTn assays, including non-coronary causes of cTn elevation, the potential benefits and risks of point-of-care testing, and the unjustified skepticism of some clinicians regarding implementation of hs-cTn assays. In everyday clinical practice, hs-cTn assays are an important diagnostic advance, predominantly for patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS), with suspected non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). In the NSTE-ACS setting, recently introduced short diagnostic algorithms using hs-cTn assays integrated with careful clinical and ECG assessment were found to substantially reduce the time to final diagnosis, shorten visits to the emergency department and allow earlier safe discharge of low risk subjects. Hs-cTn assays have significantly higher sensitivity and negative predictive value for NSTEMI in comparison to contemporary cTn tests, particularly in early NSTE-ACS presenters. However, due to frequently occurring mild hs-cTn elevations, they are also associated with lower specificity and reduced positive predictive value when compared to previous generations of assays. Our review underscores the need for the education of clinicians and medical laboratory professionals regarding appropriate use and interpretation of hs-cTn assays. Adequate training and clinical experience in using these tests are essential to translate the improved analytical performance of hs-cTn assays into enhanced risk stratification and hopefully better patient outcomes.', 11487450: 'Most clinical trials on antioxidants using vitamin E or beta-carotene have failed to note any significant change in cardiovascular endpoints.

Despite efforts to explain its high incidence, the perception remains that a significant number of hysterectomies are unjustified.

The pathology report is expected to verify the surgical indication in 66% of the cases. The other 34% of hysterectomy specimens are not expected to show tissue pathology based on the listed indication.

The mean duration of ceftriaxone therapy in our study was 11.47\\xa0days, with a range of 1-52\\xa0days. More than two-thirds (80.2%) of ceftriaxone use were found to be inappropriate and majority of unjustified ceftriaxone use emanated from inappropriate frequency of administration (78.3%), absence of culture and sensitivity test (68.7%), and duration of therapy (47%). Empiric treatment with ceftriaxone and the presence of coadministered drugs was significantly associated with its inappropriate use. The present study revealed a very high rate of inappropriate use of ceftriaxone which may potentially lead to emergence of drug-resistant microorganisms and ultimately exposes the patient to treatment failure and increased cost of therapy.\", 11645225: 'In April 1992 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced it was restricting the availability of silicone gel-filled breast implants to women enrolled in clinical trials.

In order for them to be effective, clinical guidelines need to be integrated with the care flow and provide patient-specific advice when and where needed. Hence, their formalization as computer-interpretable guidelines (CIGs) makes it possible to develop CIG-based decision-support systems (DSSs), which have a better chance of impacting clinician behavior than narrative guidelines. This paper reviews the literature on CIG-related methodologies since the inception of CIGs, while focusing and drawing themes for classifying CIG research from CIG-related publications in the Journal of Biomedical Informatics (JBI).

Few studies have compared the influence of using different monitors on dosage decisions. We determined the comparability of data generated by two portable PT monitors, Coaguchek S, (Roche Diagnostics Boehringer-Mannheim) and Hemochron Jr (International Technidyne Corporation Ltd.), with that of a reference laboratory. Simultaneous International Normalized Ratio (INR) measurements (portable monitor and laboratory) were performed in 193 consecutive patients receiving warfarin for at least 3 months. Agreement of measurements was assessed by both regression analysis and influence on dosage decisions in accordance with pre-defined criteria. The Coaguchek S versus laboratory INR regression line (n = 111; r2 = 0.88; P < 0.001) was close to the line of identity, while that of the Hemochron Jr (n = 82; r2 = 0.61; P < 0.001) was not. The overall proportion of dual INR measurements that fulfilled the clinical criteria of agreement was 90% for the Coaguchek S compared with 62% for the Hemochron Jr (P < 0.0001). For laboratory INRs 2.0-2.5, 2.6-4.0 and > 4.0, the proportions of portable measurements that satisfied the clinical criteria for the Coaguchek S versus the Hemochron Jr were 96 versus 63% (P < 0.001), 81 versus 45% (P < 0.04), and 67 versus 17% (P < 0.85), respectively. Warfarin dosing based solely on the portable devices would have resulted in unjustified dose increments in 22% of the patients with the Hemochron Jr device compared with 8% with the Coaguchek S monitor (chi2 = 4.43; P = 0.035).

At present, ACs manage patients chiefly on antivitamin K antagonists (AVKs), but patient population has already changed in the last few years, because of an increase of treatments with other anticoagulant drugs, which require different management systems. The strong increase in the number of patients at AC, mainly on long-term treatment, has determined the development of web management, through telemedicine systems, improving the quality of life and maintaining the same clinical quality levels. New oral anticoagulants (NOAs) have shown to be as effective as AVK antagonists in stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation and for treatment of venous thromboembolism in addition to VTE prophylaxis in orthopaedic surgery, when administered at a fixed dose, but patient adherence and compliance are crucial for good quality treatment. At present, lacking data from the real world, an oversimplification of treatment with NOAs could cause unjustified risks for patients and also a possible future underuse of good drugs. For these reasons the vigilance must be high and ACs can have a crucial role in defining which is the best management for NOA patients and how to do it, as it happened for AVKs.', 24922466: 'Abstract Purpose. The use of benzodiazepines remains a source of controversy. Some prescribers believe that they are beneficial and espouse their use; others regard their risk:benefit ratio as too adverse for any but occasional use. This review considers these viewpoints based on the appropriate literature. Survey. The recent English-language literature relating to this topic was surveyed. The publications proved too heterogeneous for a formal meta-analysis, so a descriptive review is provided. Overview. Surveys of benzodiazepine use provide data mainly from the UK, Europe and North America. Prescribing patterns varied widely but long-term usage is common and sometimes the norm. Conclusions. Long-term prescription of benzodiazepines still takes place despite general warnings from the medical and other professions and drug regulatory bodies that long-term use is unjustified both from the lack of a systemic database establishing such efficacy and a large literature documenting the risks of long-term usage, such as dependence. The young and the old are particularly at risk. Continued monitoring is essential, but the regulatory authorities may need to take a more active role in curbing such undesirable practice.', 24766821: \"As new antiangiogenic therapies have been introduced and added to the therapeutic arsenal against various types of cancer, previously unknown adverse effects have been detected. These effects negatively impact patients' quality of life and can even make it necessary to suspend treatment. Adverse skin reactions occur in 90% of patients treated with angiogenesis inhibitors. In some cases, a correlation has been observed between the severity of reactions and treatment efficacy and tumor response. It is therefore extremely important that dermatologists be able to recognize and manage these reactions. Moreover, in order to avoid the unjustified withdrawal of potentially life-extending treatments, dermatologists must be able to differentiate between non-life-threatening reactions and life-threatening reactions that necessitate the suspension of treatment. In this review article, we analyze the main cutaneous adverse effects of the most common antiangiogenic agents.\", 10795372: 'Although ozone therapy has been used as an alternative medical approach for four decades, it has encountered scepticism, if not outright objection, by orthodox medicine. This prejudice is not unjustified because ozone therapy often has been used without rational basis or appropriate controls. With the advent of precise medical ozone generators, it is now possible to evaluate some mechanisms of action and possible toxicity. In contrast with the respiratory tract, human blood exposed to appropriate ozone concentrations is able to tame its strong oxidant properties and neither acute nor chronic side effects have ensued in millions of patients treated with ozonated autohaemotherapy. This paper summarises studies aimed at clarifying biological effects, defining any possible damage, the therapeutic window, and suitable doses able to express therapeutic activity. Although an unfashionable and unpopular approach, it is hoped that orthodox medicine will help to critically assess the validity of ozone therapy.', 28150134: 'After three large neutral trials in which renal artery revascularization failed to reduce cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality, renal artery stenting became a therapeutic taboo. However, this is probably unjustified as these trials have important limitations and excluded patients most likely to benefit from revascularization. In particular, patients with severe hypertension were often excluded and resistant hypertension was either poorly described or not conform to the current definition. Effective pharmacological combination treatment can control blood pressure in most patients with renovascular hypertension. However, it may also induce further renal hypoperfusion and thus accelerate progressive loss of renal tissue. Furthermore, case reports of patients with resistant hypertension showing substantial blood pressure improvement after successful revascularization are published over again.

The proceedings advocate that mandatory \"behavioral teratology\" testing be made part of regulations governing approval of new drugs and chemicals. This conclusion is unjustified either by the CBTS proceedings or by the present status of \"behavioral teratology.\" First, there is little basis for accepting the validity of testing in developmental psychopharmacology, since so few agents acknowledged to lack the presumed toxic effects are explicitly identified and systematically tested. Second, findings from the CBTS itself can be construed as having indicated poor reliability: Amphetamine, the only drug examined in the CBTS, was selected for study expressly because of prior positive data, yet the study found it to be inactive. Third, the presumed \"sensitivity\" of behavioral measures is shown to be irrelevant. Fourth, and perhaps most important, the CBTS does not consider the public health risks of mandating nonvalid procedures within regulations.

An extraction method is presented based on ion exchange chromatography which yields 70-80% of highly purified antibodies. This method is quick and simple to perform. Furthermore, the substitution of mammalian IgG by avian IgY is demonstrated in two different test systems for quantitation of serum proteins relevant for diagnostic and medical basic research, respectively. The influence of adjuvant on the egg laying capacity is discussed, and the development of antibody titers is demonstrated.

It is argued in this article that this reclassification is empirically and morally implausible because sex reassignment surgery is incompatible with two major views of enhancement. It is incompatible with the nontherapeutic view because it does not improve or augment, above average, any physical or mental trait or function. It is incompatible with the welfarist view because this view, contrary to the transgender scholars's demands, is compelled to retain the standard practice of providing sex reassignment surgery in order to ensure the optimal balance between its availability, beneficence, and possible harmfulness.\", 2210190: \"The irritable intestine is one of the most frequently encountered complaints in medical practice. Although treatment is generally difficult, a therapeutic strategy which can be used in most cases is proposed. Most patients with these symptoms do not seek medical attention. The motivation for medical consultation can however be of prime importance for adequate treatment. The attending physician must first establish the reality of disease by detailed history-taking, physical examination and sigmoidoscopy. Promoting factors such as dysentery, medications, alimentation, emotions or any other major event in the patient's life must be identified. The physician must reassure and console the patient accordingly. Bran-containing diets are reliable adjuvants for most patients. Follow-up is important to guarantee patient compliance and understanding. The essential risk in the irritable bowel syndrome is the doubtfulness which hovers over the disease entity and can be responsible for patient anxiety, or prompt expensive investigations, undesirable effects of medication or even unnecessary surgery. If the patient's complaints remain unchanged at the second medical visit, other diagnostics should be considered, thus avoiding unjustified investigations. Continued empathy with the patient is important. Medication, either for their placebo or specific symptomatic action (e. g. antidiarrheics) should be considered as well. The physician has to reassure and console the patient who does not improve. The patient can then be directed to a specialized unit, but only on the physician's specific orders.\", 11225494: u'The guidelines of the German Ministery of Food, Agriculture and Forestry outlining a Salmonella surveillance programme, \"Leitlinien f\\xfcr ein Programm zur Reduzierung des Eintrags von Salmonellen durch Schlachtschweine in die Fleischgewinnung\" (February 5th, 1998), provide a staggered spot-check size depending on the annual production of slaughtery pigs. A classification of farms into three quality categories (< 20%, 20-40%, and > 40%) is performed by salmonella antibody levels detected in meat samples using ELISA. Beside a fundamental inquiry into the salmonella status, the programme ought to lead to a decreased burden on slaughtery pigs and finally to a reduced salmonella entry into meat handling and processing companies. The spot-check plan is based on an unfavourable initial position and does not consider the real situation of salmonella load in pig fattening farms. For many farms the procedure will lead to an unjustified expenditure of examinations. In simple model calculations it is shown how a significant reduction of testing amount can be reached and statistical reliability is guaranteed, too. At the same time, we attempt to find a compromise between optimal spot check size and practicability. For reasons of free enterprise, an additional category would be desirable containing farms without any positive antibody titres in the samples. The results achieved so far indicate that a large number of German slaughter pig producers would fall into this category, without the necessity of a higher examination effort.', 6586784: \"Unbiased examiners' errors have little effect on the outcome of a clinical trial, provided that they are not larger than 10%.

Professional intervention is mostly responsible for the SU component - the direct transition from sound surface to DMF. These surfaces are lost for reasons other than caries activities per se. It should not be included in the measure of caries experience in clinical trials. The component UU represents the surfaces that show incipient caries at two consecutive examinations. It represents mostly past history and has little bearing on current caries activities. Since the DMFS = IU + SU + UU, and the contributions of IU as a rule are small, the use of DMFS as a measure of caries experience in clinical trials is unjustified. The NCI = SI + IU deals directly with the stage where the cariostatic agent is supposed to be working.

A 2-day workshop with genotoxicity experts from academia, regulatory agencies and industry was hosted by the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM) in Ranco, Italy from 24 to 25 June 2008. The objectives of the workshop were to discuss how to reduce the number of animals in standard genotoxicity tests, whether the application of smarter test strategies can lead to lower animal numbers, and how the possibilities for reduction can be promoted and implemented. The workshop agreed that there are many reduction options available that are scientifically credible and therefore ready for use. Most of these are compliant with regulatory guidelines, i.e. the use of one sex only, one administration and two sampling times versus two or three administrations and one sampling time for micronucleus (MN), chromosomal aberration (CA) and Comet assays; and the integration of the MN endpoint into repeat-dose toxicity studies. The omission of a concurrent positive control in routine CA and MN tests has been proven to be scientifically acceptable, although the OECD guidelines still require this; also the combination of acute MN and Comet assay studies are compliant with guidelines, except for sampling times. Based on the data presented at the workshop, the participants concluded that these options have not been sufficiently utilized to date. Key factors for this seem to be the uncertainty regarding regulatory compliance/acceptance, lack of awareness, and an in many cases unjustified uncertainty regarding the scientific acceptance of reduction options. The workshop therefore encourages the use and promotion of these options as well as the dissemination of data related to reduction opportunities by the scientific community in order to boost the acceptance level of these approaches. Furthermore, experimental proof is needed and under way to demonstrate the credibility of additional options for reduction of the number of animals, such as the integration of the Comet assay into repeat-dose toxicity studies.', 12923304: 'Comparative studies of DNA in recent populations and characterisation of ancient hereditary material have contributed very interesting facts to our understanding of evolution of modern mankind.

However, they do have a number of disadvantages including invariable menstrual disturbance and a delay in the return of fertility. One formulation of DMPA, Depo-Provera, is probably the most extensively investigated single hormonal contraceptive ever made. These studies indicate that it is remarkably safe and does not face any more unresolved issues than the combined pill, intrauterine device or tubal sterilization.

There is no universally accepted set of criteria regarding the appropriate indications for hysterectomy. The main indications for hysterectomy include the following conditions: uterine leiomyomas, dysfunctional uterine bleeding, endometriosis/adenomyosis, chronic pelvic pain and genital prolapse. Current literature, however, routinely recommends conservative management of most nonmalignant gynecologic conditions, with hysterectomy reserved for refractory cases.

There has been little scientific study of these preparations but much emotion and rhetoric has been expended both for and against them. Potential advantages of fixed combination preparations include: increased compliance, synergy and increased efficacy, and reduced side effects and cost. Potential disadvantages include: inflexible fixed dose ratio, incompatible pharmacokinetics, increased toxicity, and physician and pharmacist ignorance of content. There are a few combinations of undisputed value such as oral contraceptives, levodopa with decarboxylase inhibitors, and pyrimethamine with sulphadoxine. In other cases fixed-dose combinations may have value in strictly specified circumstances, but are probably overprescribed. There is also widespread, unjustified use of combinations in over-the-counter preparations which may have unrecognised adverse effects. Combinations should only be used if each component is necessary for the desired effect and if the advantages outweigh the added risks of using 2 or more drugs. Before prescribing combination drugs, clinicians should always ask themselves a series of questions of which the most important is whether the patient needs each drug in a particular combination, or if 1 component alone would be adequate.

It is organised in a questions-and-answers format. There are obvious benefits to health from medical uses of radiation, in x-ray diagnostics, interventional radiology, nuclear medicine, and radiotherapy. However, there are well-established risks from high doses of radiation (radiotherapy, interventional radiology), particularly if improperly applied, and possible deleterious effects from small radiation doses (such as those used in diagnostics). Appropriate use of large doses in radiotherapy prevents serious harm, but even low doses carry a risk that cannot be eliminated entirely. Diagnostic use of radiation requires therefore such methodology that would secure high diagnostic gains while minimising the possible harm. For assessment of the risk, a quantitative measure of exposure is a necessary prerequisite. Therefore, dosimetric quantities are explained and defined (absorbed dose, effective dose). Basic facts are presented on mechanisms of action of ionising radiations on living matter. Undesired deleterious effects in man are categorised into two categories. The first one comprises sequelae resulting from massive cell killing (the so-called deterministic effects), requiring a high dose for their manifestation (exceeding the threshold dose). The second category includes those effects originating from mutational changes in the cellular DNA. These may eventually lead to development of radiation-induced cancer and to hereditary changes, transmitted to descendants of exposed individuals after irradiation of their gonads. Data on the magnitude of threshold doses for cell killing effects are presented. On the basis of experimental, clinical, and epidemiological evidence, assessment is also given of the probability with which cancers and hereditary mutations may be induced by doses of various magnitudes, most likely without a threshold dose (below which no effect would obtain). The text provides ample information on opportunities to minimise doses, and therefore the risk from diagnostic uses of radiation. This objective may be reached by avoiding unnecessary (unjustified) examinations, and by optimising the procedures applied both from the standpoint of diagnostic quality and in terms of reduction of the excessive doses to patients. Optimisation of patient protection in radiotherapy must depend on maintaining sufficiently high doses to irradiated tumours, securing a high cure rate, while protecting the healthy tissues to the largest extent possible. Problems related to special protection of the embryo and fetus in the course of diagnostic and therapeutic uses of radiation are presented and practical solutions are recommended.

Physicians who order tests excessively put an unjustified burden on the laboratory. This overuse does not contribute to the quality of medical care, does not shorten hospital stay, nor reduce mortality. In clinical departments of another large university hospital there were differences of up to 82% in the number of tests performed, despite similar size and function of the departments. Among the reasons for overuse of laboratory tests is lack of an incentive for patient, physician or clinical department to reduce costs. The fragmentation of laboratory services, the conflicting interests of hospitals, as well as the multitude of personal, institutional and professional interests, also contribute to the variety and excess of superfluous laboratory tests. Analysis leads to suggestions for simple methods to contain the number and cost of laboratory services. Introduction of a reimbursement structure and introduction of new test request forms without a \"menu\" of tests, and education of practitioners in appropriate test-ordering would promote more appropriate utilization of laboratory services. The educational initiatives would provide guidelines for the clinician as to optimal test selection, the availability of cost-efficient tests, and optimal utilization of the laboratory. Based on decision-analysis methodologies, available test profiles should be restructured to match clinical problems, treatment, and patterns of clinical thinking. Improved access to information and computer-based analysis of data should improve test selection. The suggested methods of reducing unnecessary test ordering, and strategies for more discerning use of laboratory services will undoubtedly improve the practice of medicine and improve the laboratory-physician relationship.', 12507599: StringElement('In France, no case of transfusion-transmitted malaria has been reported since 1994, reflecting the efficiency of the blood donations screening. However, an insufficiently specific serological assay leads to an unjustified loss of red cell units.', attributes={u'Label': u'UNLABELLED'}), 10923768: 'Clinical criteria alone are insufficient to allow a diagnosis of intravascular catheter-related sepsis (CRS). A definite diagnosis of CRS usually requires removal of the catheter for quantitative catheter tip culture. However, only about 15-25% of central venous catheters (CVC) removed because infection is suspected actually prove to be infected, and the diagnosis is always retrospective. Other diagnostic tests, such as differential quantitative blood cultures from samples taken simultaneously from the catheter and a peripheral vein, have been proposed to avoid unjustified removal of the catheter and the potential risks associated with the placement of a new catheter at a new site: a central-to-peripheral blood culture colony count ratio of 5:1 to 10:1 is considered indicative of CRS. Despite its high specificity, the latter diagnostic technique is not routinely used in clinical practice because of its complexity and cost. The measurement of the differential time to positivity between hub blood (taken from the catheter port) and peripheral blood cultures might be a reliable tool facilitating the diagnosis of CRS in situ. In an in vitro study, we found a strong relationship between the inoculum size of various microorganisms and the time to positivity of cultures. When the times to positivity of cultures of blood taken simultaneously from central and peripheral veins in patients with and without CRS were examined, we found that earlier positivity of central vs peripheral vein blood cultures was highly correlated with CRS. Using a cut-off value of +120 min, the \"differential time to positivity\" of the paired blood samples, defined as time to positivity of the peripheral blood minus that of the hub blood culture, had 91% specificity and 94% sensitivity for the diagnosis of CRS. This method may be coupled with other techniques that have high negative predictive value, such as skin cultures at the catheter exit site. This diagnostic test can be proposed for routine clinical practice in most hospitals using automatic devices for blood cultures positivity detection. Endoluminal brushing of the catheter is considered sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of CRS, but the risk of embolisation or subsequent bacteraemia should be considered. Gram staining and the acridine-orange leucocyte cytospin test on through-catheter blood culture have been proposed for rapid diagnosis of CRS without catheter removal. The technique, which requires 100 microl catheter blood and the use of light and ultraviolet microscopy, is considered simple, rapid (30 min) and inexpensive. In conclusion, diagnostic tools such as paired blood cultures or Gram staining and the acridine-orange leucocyte cytospin test should allow a diagnosis of CRS without catheter removal in cancer patients.', 3099090: 'Consideration of the autocatalytic synthesis of ribosomal proteins leads to a criterion for the infectivity of a foreign proteinaceous species in terms of the biochemical rate constants governing the propagation of errors during the translation of genetic information in a model system. Evidence pertaining to the suggestion that scrapie and its analogues are caused by proteinaceous infectious agents (prions) which replicate by invading the translation process and altering ribosomal specificity is examined. It is found that anomalous aetiological features of scrapie infection are explained by the model. An analysis suggesting that the possibility of prion replication undermines the basis of current molecular biological theory is provided and it is concluded that the exclusive identification of biological information with nucleic acid sequences is unjustified.', 10793429: 'In dual chamber pacemakers, atrial sensing performance is decisive for maintenance of AV synchrony. Particularly, the efficacy of mode switching algorithms during intermittent atrial tachyarrhythmias depends on the sensitive detection of low potential amplitudes. Therefore, a high atrial sensitivity of 0.18 mV, commonly used in single lead VDD pacemakers, was investigated for its efficacy and safety in DDD pacing. Thirty patients received dual chamber pacemakers and bipolar atrial screw-in leads for sinus node syndrome or AV block; 15 patients suffered from intermittent atrial fibrillation. Pace makers were programmed to an atrial sensitivity of 0.18 mV. Two weeks, 3, 9, and 15 months after implantation, P wave sensing threshold and T wave oversensing thresholds for the native and paced T wave were determined. The myopotential oversensing thresholds were evaluated by isometric contraction of the pectoral muscles. Automatic mode switch to DDIR pacing was activated when the mean atrial rate exceeded 180 beats/min. The patients were followed by 24-hour Holter monitoring. Two weeks after implantation, mean atrial sensing threshold was 1.81 +/- 0.85 mV (range 0.25-2.8 mV) without significant differences during further follow-up. Native T wave sensing threshold was < 0.18 mV in all patients. In 13% of patients, paced T waves were perceived in the atrial channel at the highest sensitivity. This T wave sensing could easily be avoided by programming a postventricular atrial refractory period exceeding 300 ms. Myopotential oversensing could not be provoked and Holter records showed no signs of sensing dysfunction. During a 15-month follow-up, 1,191 mode switch events were counted by autodiagnostic pacemaker function. Forty-two of these events occurred during Holter monitoring. Unjustified mode switch was not observed. In DDD pacemakers, bipolar atrial sensing with a very high sensitivity is efficient and safe. Using these sensitivity settings, activation of the mode switch algorithm almost completely avoids fast transmission of atrial rate to the ventricle during atrial fibrillation.', 11758039: \"The authors used vignettes to solicit each participant's estimate of the likelihood of help and his/her recommendation for or against helping a student who needed to borrow another student's class notes. The study had a 2 (Hindu vs. Muslim participant) x 2 (participant's gender) x 2 (liking vs. disliking relationship) x 2 (justified vs. unjustified need for help) x 2 (low vs. high cost of helping) factorial design with 15 participants per cell. Estimated likelihood of help was higher among the female than among the male participants, with the liking than with the disliking relationship, and with the low rather than with the high cost of helping. The Hindu participants gave lower estimates of the likelihood of help than did the Muslim participants with the disliking relationship and with the unjustified need for help. Intracommunal helping, irrespective of contextual variations, may have been a stronger social norm for the Muslim than for the Hindu participants, probably because of the former's minority status in India and, more important, the Islamic prescription of communal brotherhood. Even though both communities are deemed collectivist, the Indian Muslim participants' helping norms appeared to be more obligation oriented and less option oriented than those of the Indian Hindu participants.\", 16787935: 'Defenders of tax preferences for nonprofit hospitals and health plans, including Mark Schlesinger and Brad Gray, contend that nonprofits deserve government support because they provide greater \"community benefit\" than their for-profit counterparts.

It's prevalence in India continues to range from 70 to 90%. Although anemia is multifactorial in etiology, preventative efforts have predominantly focused on increasing iron intake, primarily through supplementation in pregnant and lactating women. Policy thrust for childhood anemia is only recent. However, program implementation is dismal; only 3.8-4.7% of preschoolers receive iron-folate supplements. There is an urgent need for effective governance and implementation. Policy makers must distinguish anemia from iron deficiency, and introduce additional area-specific interventions as an integrated package.Increased iron intake may yield maximum benefit but will only address up to half the burden. In 6-59 months old children, instead of 100 days' continuous dosing with iron-folate syrup in a year, a directly supervised intermittent supplementation (biweekly; ~100 days per year) merits consideration. Multiple micronutrient powders for home fortification of foods in 6-23 months old infants do not appear viable. Additional interventions include delayed cord clamping, earlier supplementation in low birth weight infants, appropriate infant and young child feeding guidelines, and intermittent supervised supplementation in children and adolescents through school health programs. Use of double (iron-folate)-fortified salt in mid-day meal programs deserves piloting.Important area-specific, non-iron interventions include targeted deworming, and prevention and treatment of hemoglobinopathies, malaria and other common infections.

Two orthopedic examiners individually examined all patients, recording clinical diagnosis and the merit of MRI evaluation in each case.

Effect-size and mean-score changes were calculated for each agent separately as well as pooled effect sizes and mean changes on the basis of the data reported by Kirsch et al. The weighted mean improvement was (depending on the method of calculation) 10.04 or 10.16 points on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) in the drug groups, instead of 9.60, and thus the correct drug-placebo difference is 2.18 or 2.68 instead of 1.80. Kirsch et al. failed to report that that the change in HAMD score was 3.15 or 3.47 points for venlafaxine and 3.12 or 3.22 for paroxetine, which are above the NICE threshold. Still the figures for fluoxetine and nefazodone are low. Thus it seems that the Kirsch et al.'s meta-analysis suffered from important flaws in the calculations; reporting of the results was selective and conclusions unjustified and overemphasized. Overall the results suggest that although a large percentage of the placebo response is due to expectancy this is not true for the active drug and effects are not additive.

The contentions that physician-industry collaboration is problematic are not based on evidence. They depend on unjustified generalization from inevitable, sometimes egregious, but vanishingly uncommon adverse outcomes of industry-physician interaction without reference to how so much more commonly these interactions add value. Furthermore, the claim that physician-industry collaboration is unprofessional is refuted by rational scrutiny. Indeed, the term \"conflict of interest\" itself is vague, inviting subjectivity and deserving to be rejected. The unwarranted success of conflict of interest regulation has prevailed because of the failure of physicians, educators, and innovators, through apathy and intimidation, to pay attention to its fallacies and resist its dangers. It has arisen from activist ambitions and from misalignment between the purposes of medical practitioners, educators, and innovators and those of administrators in medical journals and in academic medical centers. The media and politicians have not appreciated these misalignments and have accepted conflict of interest arguments at face value.

This agreement and others are part of the treaty that established the World Trade Organization (WTO). The WTO superseded the GATT as the umbrella organization for international trade (WTO, 1998a). The SPS agreement's main intent is to provide guidelines and provisions to member countries to facilitate trade while taking measures to protect human, animal or plant life or health. The agreement dictates that all sanitary measures must be scientifically based and not more restrictive than required to avoid the risk identified. The agreement recommends the use of international standards from the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), Codex Alimentarius (CAC) and the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) as the basis for import requirements. If a country chooses to apply more restrictive measures than those in the international standards, it has to justify its position through a risk analysis, thus avoiding the use of sanitary and phytosanitary measures as unjustified barriers to trade. More than ever, veterinary services worldwide are faced with having to fulfill a crucial role in protecting their country's animal health status, provide sound surveillance information on the occurrence of diseases within their territories, and conduct scientifically valid risk analyses to establish justified import requirements. During the past two decades, most countries have experienced resource reduction in their veterinary services. The effect of these policies has been severe, in many cases leading to an inability of veterinary services to conduct their disease prevention and control duties. There is a clear inconsistency between the demands placed on veterinary services and the current level of funding and support they are receiving, particularly in the developing world. This paper analyzes the implications in complying with the SPS agreement and explores the role of veterinary epidemiology in developing viable alternatives that can enhance the veterinary services' ability to perform under the current economic reality. The key provisions of the SPS agreement are regionalization, risk analysis, harmonization, equivalence and transparency. The paper focuses on the contribution of epidemiology in each of these areas in the effective implementation of the SPS agreement.\", 26712665: 'In June 2015, invitations were sent by email to 151 APAME journals to participate in an online survey with an objective of gaining insight into the common publication misconduct encountered by APAME editors.

The relationship between personality and academic performance has long been explored, and a recent meta-analysis established that measures of the five-factor model (FFM) dimension of Conscientiousness have similar validity to intelligence measures. Although currently dominant, the FFM is only one of the currently accepted models of personality, and has limited theoretical support. In contrast, the Eysenckian personality model was developed to assess a specific theoretical model and is still commonly used in educational settings and research. AIMS. This meta-analysis assessed the validity of the Eysenckian personality measures for predicting academic performance. SAMPLE. Statistics were obtained for correlations with Psychoticism, Extraversion, and Neuroticism (20-23 samples; N from 8,013 to 9,191), with smaller aggregates for the Lie scale (7 samples; N= 3,910). METHODS. The Hunter-Schmidt random effects method was used to estimate population correlations between the Eysenckian personality measures and academic performance. Moderating effects were tested using weighted least squares regression. RESULTS. Significant but modest validities were reported for each scale. Neuroticism and Extraversion had relationships with academic performance that were consistent with previous findings, while Psychoticism appears to be linked to academic performance because of its association with FFM Conscientiousness. Age and educational level moderated correlations with Neuroticism and Extraversion, and gender had no moderating effect. Correlations varied significantly based on the measurement instrument used. CONCLUSIONS. The Eysenckian scales do not add to the prediction of academic performance beyond that provided by FFM scales. Several measurement problems afflict the Eysenckian scales, including low to poor internal reliability and complex factor structures. In particular, the measurement and validity problems of Psychoticism mean its continued use in academic settings is unjustified.', 11694685: StringElement(\"The treatment of pediatric patients with drugs in hospitals is being impeded by a shortage in the availability of licensed drugs in an appropriate formulation.

We have introduced a method to assess the population representativeness of related clinical trials using electronic health record (EHR) data.

The present study reports secondary analyses from a similar, preexisting data set in which treatment-by-severity interactions are systematically investigated with depressed outpatients treated either with nondirective psychotherapy, behaviour therapy, pharmacotherapy, or relaxation/placebo. Despite multiple severity measures and variable severity cut scores, no treatment was differentially effective in improving more severely depressed patients. Also, there was little difference across symptom severity levels in the proportions of recovered patients between treatment groups. Finally, dynamic cluster analysis demonstrated that the proportion of pharmacotherapy nonresponders (20%) did not differ from the proportion of nonresponders in behaviour therapy or placebo groups. It is concluded that this failure to replicate the NIMH trial findings can not be attributed to treatment differences, populations or statistical power. The suggestion that pharmacotherapy be the treatment of choice for more severely depressed outpatients appears to be unjustified on the basis of available evidence.', 18815599: StringElement('Workplace bullying is a growing concern amongst health professionals.

We studied 1.077 consecutive patients admitted to the General Hospital of Vienna who were treated for suspected acute MI with thrombolytic agents between January 1992 and December 1998. In 39 patients (3.6%) MI was ruled out on the basis of persistently normal creatine kinase (CK) levels. By means of chart review and database inquiry 28 (72%) of these patients were finally diagnosed as having an acute coronary syndrome (coronary group); 11 patients (non-coronary group) had other diagnoses (pericarditis in 5 cases). Comparison of the coronary vs. the non-coronary group showed no differences in risk factors, in the history of cardiac events and vital signs at the time of admission. Statistically significant differences were found in age [61 (IQR 50-70) years in the coronary group vs. 47 (IQR 47-55) years in the non-coronary group, p = 0.009], in gender distribution (p = 0.007), in the ST-depression score [4 (IQR 1-5) mm vs. 0 (IQR 0-0) mm, p < 0.0001], in the difference between highest CK level and CK level at admission [21 (IQR 8-35) U/I vs. 0 (IQR 0-0) U/I, p < 0.0001] and in the time difference from admission to highest CK level [6 (IQR 3-10) hours vs. 0 (IQR 0-0) hours, p < 0.0001].

Receptorial scintigraphy with radio-labeled analogues (Octreoscan) is the first choice investigation for staging and follow-up of endocrine GEP tumors, thanks to the high sensitivity in revealing the primary tumor and metastases, and for its capability to reveal lesions that are not identified by other imaging methods. Moreover, somatostatin analogues uptake by tumors allow us to use radiopharmaceutical compounds for advanced disease treatment. Between the radio-labeled drugs until now studied, interesting results have been obtained by DOTA-lanreotide (MAURITIUS), DOTA0 Tyr3-octreotide (DOTATOC) and DOTA0 Tyr3-octreotate, bound to beta-emitting radio-isotope suitable for therapeutic use. In the field of the pharmacological therapy of GEP tumors, the clinical trials show that somatostatin analogues reduce the symptoms related to functionally active tumors and stabilize or slow tumor growth improving the patient quality of life. Although somatostatin analogues alone could not be able to cure GEP tumors, their early utilization in association with surgical debulking of primary tumor and metastases, embolization or chemoembolization, and interferon, chemotherapy and radio-metabolic therapy (mainly directed to the destruction of micrometastases), increases the possibility of a radical therapeutic intervention. The continuous evolution of pharmacological research provides always new analogues (octreotide LAR, lanreotide, vapreotide, BIM-23244, BN 81644, PTR-3173, BIM-23A387, SOM-230, etc.) with different pharmacokinetic and receptorial properties and acting with more effectiveness in the different individual clinical situations.

In order to test this notion, we used the perceived distance between one\\'s chronological age and the age assigned to the social categories of \"older driver\" and \"old person\" as an indicator of age-group dissociation or identification, respectively. Self-serving evaluations were expected depending on the distance between chronological and subjective age estimates. In addition to this, we tested gender and age effects on the specific evaluations. A sample of 350 participants aged 19-88 completed an online questionnaire on negative and positive stereotypes about older drivers and road safety measures. Results indicated in general a more positive than negative view of older drivers; approval with measures to increase road safety by regulating older drivers was comparatively low. Female participants tended to agree more with negative stereotypes and regulative measures than male participants. Regression analyses revealed as well that increasing chronological age was associated with less agreement with negative stereotypes and measures for road safety. Differences between chronological age and subjective age estimates of when a person is old or an old driver were differentially related with the criteria. The closer the chronological age and subjective age estimates were the lower was the agreement with negative stereotypes and measures to regulate road safety.

Oral NSAIDs are not very patient friendly, as they cause various gastrointestinal adverse effects like bleeding, ulceration, and perforation. To enhance the tolerability of diclofenac and decrease the common side effects, aceclofenac (ACE) was developed by its chemical modification. As expected, ACE is more well-tolerated than diclofenac and possesses superior efficacy but is not completely devoid of the NSAID-tagged side effects.

Os was included in the ICHD II Appendix as a diagnostic criterion of M. It disappeared in ICHD-3 beta. To understand this choice, we reviewed the literature after 2004. Methods This was a systematic review. We searched in PubMed, MEDLINE and Cochrane library for \"osmophobia\", \"odour/odorphobia AND headache\", \"odour/odor hypersensitivity AND headache\" and \"olfactory hypersensitivity AND headache\". Results 112 papers cited Os as an accompanying symptom of headache; 16 focused on Os in M diagnosis. With the data from 40 articles, we calculated the pooled prevalence of Os in 14,360 patients (2281 pediatric) affected by M (n\\u2009=\\u200912,496) and TTH (n\\u2009=\\u20091864). In M, the prevalence was 48.5% (CI 95% 41.4 to 55.8%) in adults and 23.4% (CI 95% 15.7 to 33.4%) in pediatric patients; in TTH, the prevalence was 8.9% (CI 95% 4.6 to 13.5%) in adults and 7.9% (CI 95% 3.3 to 18.1%) in pediatric patients. Ten of these papers allowed us to calculate the sensibility and specificity of Os in differential diagnosis between M and TTH. In adults, the value of specificity was 94.1% (CI 95% 88.9 to 96.9%), and sensitivity was 51.4% (CI 95% 38.4 to 64.2%). In pediatric patients, specificity was 92.0% (CI 95% 81.9 to 96.7%), and sensitivity was 22.1% (CI 95% 10.1 to 41.8%).

Combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy has yielded encouraging results in patients with locally advanced diseases. Our increased knowledge of cancer at the molecular level has transformed our understanding of tumor radiation resistance. Preclinical models have shown that several biologic agents designed to target specifically these molecular processes are radiosensitizing agents. Many of these agents are in the process of clinical evaluation with radiotherapy. The translation of these findings into the clinical setting will be feasible only if early phase I trials demonstrate their safety when combined with ionizing radiation. The combination of new drugs and radiation might not necessarily be equivalent to the toxicity of the new drug plus the usual toxicity of radiation. The doses and schedule to be explored for the new drug might vary from those assessed for the new drug alone. Inappropriate evaluation of a combination regimen can result in unjustified abandonment of a combination, or adoption of a regimen at toxic dose levels because of poor toxicity monitoring. Beside the 'in field' radiation dose-dependent symptoms, 'outside the field' symptoms that are not dose dependent might be identified.

Initial experiments to protect the purified protein against these changes were unsuccessful and unless further attempts are more encouraging, fresh-frozen plasma may be the only current economic source of opsonically active fibronectin.

This in-depth interview study conducted in three UK acute hospital organisations in 2003-2004 explored how professional boundaries affected efforts to improve routine practice by acute pain services (small specialist teams set up to drive improvements in postoperative pain management through education, training, standard-setting and audit). The study found that many anaesthetists and to a lesser extent nursing staff saw postoperative pain management as a new and unjustified addition to their professional role. Professional identities and strong fears about the risks of treatments meant that health professionals resisted attempts by the acute pain services to standardise practice and to change medical and nursing roles in relation to postoperative pain management. Efforts by the acute pain services to improve practice were further hindered by inter-professional boundaries (between the medical and nursing professions) and by intra-professional boundaries (within the medical and nursing professions). The inter-professional boundaries led to the acute pain services devoting a substantial part of their time to performing a 'go-between' function between nurses and doctors. The intra-professional boundaries hindered collaborative working among doctors and limited the influence that the acute pain service nurses could have on improving the practice of other nurses. Further work is needed to address the underlying fears that can lead to resistance around role changes and to develop effective strategies to minimise the impact of professional boundaries on patient care.\", 15127242: 'This brief overview discusses which of the diagnostic options are more reliable and effective for breast cancer imaging with a view to avoiding the unjustified use of techniques that are suboptimal. The technological development of diagnostic imaging has been very impressive, and both radiological (mammography, ultrasonography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging) and nuclear medicine tools (bone scan, planar and SPECT scintigraphy, sentinel node biopsy, positron emission tomography) have helped to overcome past limitations in the detection of small lesions. Furthermore, new approaches have been developed that permit successful differential diagnosis of doubtful lesions and rapid identification of systemic metastases, and allow non-invasive characterisation of the biology of cancer tissue. There is evidence that these advances may have helped in optimising therapeutic strategies. Importantly, the metabolic information provided by nuclear medicine procedures may be combined with the anatomical data supplied by radiological techniques in order to assist in predicting tumour response, planning radiotherapy and monitoring patient outcome. It is difficult to formulate conclusive diagnostic guidelines for application in the work-up of breast cancer, because while the role of some examinations, such as mammography and ultrasonography, is well established, that of others, such as magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography, is still a matter of debate. There is a need for further prospective evaluations with appropriate clinical trials designed to evaluate the impact of these approaches in improving survival and quality of life.', 28809933: 'Shallow water zooxanthellate coral reefs grade into ecologically distinct mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs) deeper in the euphotic zone. MCEs are widely considered to start at an absolute depth limit of 30m deep, possibly failing to recognise that these are distinct ecological communities that may shift shallower or deeper depending on local environmental conditions. This study aimed to explore whether MCEs represent distinct biological communities, the upper boundary of which can be defined and whether the depth at which they occur may vary above or below 30m. Mixed-gas diving and closed-circuit rebreathers were used to quantitatively survey benthic communities across shallow to mesophotic reef gradients around the island of Utila, Honduras. Depths of up to 85m were sampled, covering the vertical range of the zooxanthellate corals around Utila. We investigate vertical reef zonation using a variety of ecological metrics to identify community shifts with depth, and the appropriateness of different metrics to define the upper MCE boundary. Patterns observed in scleractinian community composition varied between ordination analyses and approaches utilising biodiversity indices. Indices and richness approaches revealed vertical community transition was a gradation. Ordination approaches suggest the possibility of recognising two scleractinian assemblages. We could detect a mesophotic and shallow community while illustrating that belief in a static depth limit is biologically unjustified. The switch between these two communities occurred across bathymetric gradients as small as 10m and as large as 50m in depth. The difference between communities appears to be a loss of shallow specialists and increase in depth-generalist taxa. Therefore, it may be possible to define MCEs by a loss of shallow specialist species. To support a biological definition of mesophotic reefs, we advocate this analytical framework should be applied around the Caribbean and extended into other ocean basins where MCEs are present.', 19162233: \"Evolutionary Terminology Auditing (ETA) is a novel way to assess the quality of terminologies using reality as benchmark.

Influenza virus appears in ever changing and new antigenic forms against which there is little or no immunity. Past failures in the battle against the disease may have been due to poor vaccines and limited vaccination strategies: vaccination of narrowly limited populations with vaccines that often are only poorly antigenic; frequent changing from one vaccine strain to another and the inherent problem of inadequate vaccine supplies for timely wide-scale public health campaigns; and the unjustified expectation that influenza virus vaccines will afford protection against non-influenza virus-induced influenza-like disease. Potent whole virus influenza vaccines should be given a chance in broad-scale vaccination programs designed to interrupt the spread of the virus and provide an immunological base against future virus variants.', 12577499: 'Magnesium sulphate (MgSO4) is with a proved effectiveness in cases of praeclampsia/eclampsia, but its use as a tocolytic is discussed in the last few years. That is why we had for an object to study its effect as a tocolytic in cases of abortions and premature labours. The study is prospective and if is made in I-st obstetric clinic of High Medical School--Pleven. Treatment with Cormagnesin was carried out to pregnant women for suppressing the uterine activity. Cormagnesin 200 (1 amp-10 ml) contains 1000 mg MgSO4, and Cormagnesin 400 (1 amp-10 ml) contains 2000 mg MgSO4. The medicine was administered in dosage of 4 or 5 g for 30 min, and after that if there were any uterine contractions the infusion was carried on with additional 5 g MgSO4 for 6 to 12 h. The total dosage was from 4 to 60 g MgSO4. The authors reported on very good effect in cases with pains and increased uterine tone--18 (36.73%), as well as in cases with pains and irregular uterine contractions 5 (10.21%), while the treatment was without any effect in cases with uterine contractions on 15-20 min, increased uterine tone, bleeding and Pelvic score 1-3 points in spite of high dosages of MgSO4 and longer duration of treatment. The authors made the conclusion, that the subjective complaints should not be accepted as an indication for administration of MgSO4, and MgSO4 should be administered in cases with increased uterine tone and irregular uterine contractions. Every genital bleeding and suspicion for placental abruption should be defined more precisely, because lately diagnosed placental abruption and unjustified expectation for suppression of uterine activity by MgSO4, may lead to increase of perinatal morbidity and mortality. In spite of the controversial data about MgSO4 as a tocolytic, its administration is justified and necessary.', 23401181: u'In many medical studies, researchers widely use composite or long ordinal scores, that is, scores that have a large number of categories and a natural ordering often resulting from the sum of a number of short ordinal scores, to assess function or quality of life. Typically, we analyse these using unjustified assumptions of normality for the outcome measure, which are unlikely to be even approximately true. Scores of this type are better analysed using methods reserved for more conventional (short) ordinal scores, such as the proportional-odds model. We can avoid the need for a large number of cut-point parameters that define the divisions between the score categories for long ordinal scores in the proportional-odds model by the inclusion of orthogonal polynomial contrasts. We introduce the repeated measures proportional-odds logistic regression model and describe for long ordinal outcomes modifications to the generalized estimating equation methodology used for parameter estimation. We introduce data from a trial assessing two surgical interventions, briefly describe and re-analyse these using the new model and compare inferences from the new analysis with previously published results for the primary outcome measure (hip function at 12\\u2009months postoperatively). We use a simulation study to illustrate how this model also has more general application for conventional short ordinal scores, to select amongst competing models of varying complexity for the cut-point parameters.', 18229989: 'This preliminary study evaluated the effectiveness of psychotherapy treatment for adult clinical depression provided in a natural setting by benchmarking the clinical outcomes in a managed care environment against effect size estimates observed in published clinical trials. Overall results suggest that effect size estimates of effectiveness in a managed care context were comparable to effect size estimates of efficacy observed in clinical trials. Relative to the 1-tailed 95th-percentile critical effect size estimates, effectiveness of treatment provided in this setting was observed to be between 80% (patients with comorbidity and without antidepressants) and 112% (patients without comorbidity concurrently on antidepressants) as compared to the benchmarks. Because the nature of the treatments delivered in the managed care environment were unknown, it was not possible to make conclusions about treatments. However, while replications are warranted, concerns that psychotherapy delivered in a naturalistic setting is inferior to treatments delivered in clinical trials appear unjustified.', 29313768: 'Clinicians at quaternary centers see part of their mission as providing hope when others cannot. They tend to see sicker patients with more complex disease processes. Part of this mission is offering longshot treatment modalities that are unlikely to achieve their stated goal, but conceivably could. When patients embark on such a treatment plan, it may fail. Often treatment toward an initial goal continues beyond the point at which such a goal is feasible. We explore the progression of care from longshot to fantasy using two pediatric cases. This progression may be differentiated into four distinct stages of care related to the potential of achieving the initial goals of care. Physicians are often ill prepared for the progression of treatments from a longshot hope to an unfeasible and, therefore, typically unjustified intervention. We present a structured approach to guide clinicians at referral institutions where these situations may be common. The transition of care from \"longshot\" to \"fantasy\" is an inherent part of quaternary care for the sickest of patients that has been underexplored. Physicians are often poorly equipped to approach that transition. We advocate this approach to the shift from longshot to fantasy with the belief that such a structured method will have multiple benefits, including: reduced suffering for the patient; decreased emotional burden on patient and family; decreased provider moral distress; increased likelihood of seeking high quality palliative care earlier; and provision of honest and straightforward information to patients and their families.', 27443946: StringElement('To describe the results of increasing availability and quality of caesarean deliveries and anaesthesia in rural Tanzania.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'OBJECTIVE', u'Label': u'OBJECTIVE'}), 3666669: 'A questionnaire containing a list of 36 questions and nine \"fear factors\" was sent to 139 patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

The most important questions selected were possibilities of remission of the disease, and of developing cancer (47% and 43% of all answers respectively). Women judged questions regarding cancer, sex life, side effects of diagnostic techniques or drugs to be important more often than men, who were more interested in the cause, symptoms and natural history of the disease. Cancer was the fear factor selected most often (52%), being more important to patients with ulcerative colitis than to those with Crohn\\'s disease, who in turn were more afraid of surgery than those with ulcerative colitis. 77% of the patients felt they had little or too little information. 87% received information from their physicians, 75% wanted to continue doing so. 62% wanted additional information from booklets, 18% from self-help groups.

However, generator produced 68Ga is typically of suboptimal purity, mainly due to the breakthrough of the parent radionuclide 68Ge. Modern automated synthesis modules adopt both fractionation methods and purification methods in order to get rid of 68Ge breakthrough. Purification methods are mainly based on based on cationic prepurification even if anionic purification has been adopted as well. This work studies the efficacy of cationic prepurification using commercial STRATA-X-C, as well as distribution of the 68Ge contaminant during all steps of the synthesis of labeled peptides. Generator waste, STRATA-X-C purification cartridge, synthesis waste and the final product are quantitatively analyzed by means of high resolution gamma ray spectrometry. Our results show that current method of purification is highly effective; initial 68Ge breakthrough of the order of 1 kBq is decreased by a factor greater than 100, with removal of about 61% of the contaminant 68Ge in the first purification passage; this allow an efficient labeling, since removal of the remaining impurity happens during chelation in the reactor vessel. In conclusion, the synthesis with modular automated system resulted to reliably produce 68Ga-DOTANOC, with limited if any user intervention. 68Ge content in the final formulation results lower than 2x10(-7)%, avoiding unjustified patient irradiation due to radionuclidic impurities and satisfying quality prerequisites for radiopharmaceutical preparations.', 18072318: 'Australia has a National Medicines Policy with aims that include quality use of medicines, but policy stakeholders failed to protect Australia from the COX-2 (cyclo-oxygenase-2) inhibitor disaster.

This report analyzes the second National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study (NASCIS-2) and its subsequent reportage. NASCIS-2 was an elaborate protocol consisting of the randomized blinded use of methylprednisolone (MP), naloxone or placebo in 487 patients within 12 hours of spinal cord injury.

Carefully selected and correctly administered antibiotics can provide effective protection of the implant from bacterial colonization. The prevention of deep wound infection in joint replacement includes several procedures and measures which constitute three basic groups: 1) Promotion of patient's ability to resist infection (careful pre-operative preparation, elimination of potential infectious loci, good nutritional status, etc). 2) Optimal conditions for the operative wound (surgical technique, prophylactic antibiotics). 3) Reduction of the number of bacteria brought in the wound (control measures, super-sterile operating theatres). Clear rules for the system of prophylactic antibiotic treatment should be adopted. A program in which responsibility for antibiotic administration was shifted from the nursing staff to the anesthesiologist in the operating theatre showed improved outcomes and reduced costs. Poor timing of prophylactic antibiotic administration is one of the basic mistakes. If the wound happened to be contaminated during surgery, the first three post-operative hours would be most decisive for the development of infection. An effective bactericidal concentration of antibiotic should be present in tissues and serum immediately after surgery has begun. Therefore the appropriate time for antibiotic application is before a skin incision is made, and not after the operation has started; the highest serum and bone tissue levels appear 20 to 30 min. after intravenous antibiotic injection. To allow antibiotics to reach target tissues, they should be introduced at least 10 min. before tourniquet application. For long surgical procedures or when blood loss is high, an additional dose of antibiotics is recommended during the operation. If a sample for bacterial cultivation is required, antibiotic administration is postponed until during surgery. However, this is used only in indicated cases when deep infection is suspected and no assessment of the causative agent is available. Otherwise this approach carries a high risk of infectious complications in aseptic revision arthroplasty. Long-term, unjustified administration of antibiotics leads to an increase in resistance to the antibiotic involved. Some studies show that a day's course is as effective as a seven-day one. A shorter antibiotic course decreases the costs, reduces side-effects and minimizes the development of resistance. An optimal duration of antibiotic treatment has not been defined yet, and is still a hot issue for discussion. Many authors recommend one pre-operative antibiotic dose and, according to the kind of antibiotic, agree to its 24-hour administration in order to lower the toxic effect of antibiotic and to prevent selection of resistant microorganisms. The choice of suitable antibiotics for prophylactic treatment should be based on the range of agents causing joint replacement infections and the pharmacological properties of the drug. This should have minimal toxicity, should be well tolerated by the patient and, from the epidemiological point of view, should have a low risk of inducing resistance because of frequent use. Naturally, it is not possible to include all antibiotics against all causative agents and therefore attention should be paid, in the first place, to Gram-positive bacteria, i. e., staphylococci and streptococci, which are the most common causes of infectious complications associated with joint replacement. Because of difficulties related to the right choice of antibiotic, it is recommended to keep a record of complications in each patient in order to provide feedback and to facilitate the establishment of reliable antibiotic-based prevention. The prevention of infection in orthopedics is a comprehensive issue. It cannot be expected that prophylactic antibiotic treatment will compensate for mistakes made in operative protocols, for inadequate operative techniques, for shortcomings in operating theatre equipment or insufficient preparation of patients.\", 14641953: StringElement('To examine associations between breakfast cereal consumption and the dietary habits, nutrient intakes and nutritional status of young people, considering both nutrient adequacy and safety issues (fortification).', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'OBJECTIVE', u'Label': u'OBJECTIVE'}), 25183025: StringElement('The aim of this study was to assess the rate of discrepancies in medication reconciliation on admission patients in a trauma unit, and identifying potential risk factors associated with these discrepancies.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'BACKGROUND', u'Label': u'INTRODUCTION'}), 26942248: 'No existing weight loss drug has an acceptable harm-benefit balance.

Those individuals dying of smoking-related causes (\"phantoms\") remain at risk of AD and of death from other causes. Three scenarios were considered: no association of AD and smoking, increased risk for smokers, and decreased risk for smokers. For each simulation of a cohort study, two incidence density ratios (IDR) were computed: one including the phantoms that developed AD (thus ignoring smoking-related deaths) and another excluding them (thus mimicking real-life studies). For all scenarios, the simulations show that smoking-related death creates a bias, resulting in smokers having an understated risk of AD compared to non-smokers. The speculation that the conflicting results of case-control and cohort studies are solely due to the increased mortality in smokers thus appears unjustified. Other factors must also be considered to explain the discrepancy in results.', 86833: 'In a prospective survey jejunal biopsy samples from 11 patients with multiple sclerosis on normal diets were compared with those from controls matched for age and sex.

Comparison between sporadic AAA (SAAA) and familial AAA (FAAA) demonstrated the following differences: 1) diagnosis was made earlier in FAAA (p < 0.05) than in SAAA (64.1 versus 66 years of age respectively), 2) patients with FAAA were younger at the time of rupture (65.4 versus 75.1 years, p < 0.001), 3) the incidence of rupture was greater in FAAA than in SAAA (32.4% versus 8.7% p < 0.001), and finally 4) the relative risk of developing AAA was 18 times greater in members of a family with AAA than in the reference population.

The natural history of lobular carcinoma in situ and intraductal cancer, two of the components of minimal breast cancer, is described. The dangers of relying on a data base established on the strength of retrospective anecdotal information is underscored. Lobular carcinoma in situ has a propensity for multicentricity and bilaterality. In 25% of patients with lobular carcinoma in situ, invasive breast cancer will develop subsequently, and the majority of these tumours will be of ductal origin. The average interval from the diagnosis of lobular carcinoma in situ to the development of subsequent invasive cancer is over 15 years and both breasts are at equal risk. Based on this information, the use of bilateral prophylactic mastectomy is unjustified. In contrast to lobular carcinoma in situ, 25% to 50% of patients with intraductal carcinoma will subsequently have infiltrating cancer, at an average of 10 years after the initial biopsy. Although the putative incidence of multicentricity is 50%, virtually all subsequent invasive cancers occur not only in the same breast but in the same quadrant as the initial lesion.

Also reported is the attenuation of perceived exertion and enhancement of affect during prolonged exercise following CHO ingestion. However, no studies to date have assessed the impact of the type of CHO ingested on affective responses during moderate intensity exercise, lasting 60 min or less. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of consuming a galactose (GAL) CHO drink versus a glucose (GLU) CHO or placebo (PLA) drink before and during exercise on affect and perceived exertion. Nine recreationally active females undertook three trials, each consisting of running for 60 min at 65% VO2max followed immediately by a 90 min rest period. Prior to (300 ml) and at every 15 min during exercise (150 ml), participants consumed either a GLU or GAL drink each containing 45 g of CHO, or an artificially-sweetened PLA drink. Ratings of pleasure-displeasure and perceived activation were measured throughout exercise and the rest period and measures of perceived exertion were measured during exercise. Plasma glucose and serum insulin were significantly greater throughout exercise and rest following the GLU trial compared with the GAL and PLA trials (P<0.05). Measures of perceived activation and pleasure-displeasure were not enhanced nor RPE reduced as a result of ingestion of a CHO solution. In conclusion, the GAL beverage elicited a more favourable metabolic profile in the exercising females but this did not translate into an enhanced affective profile. Indeed, CHO ingestion had no noticeable effect on the assessed psychological indices during 60 min of moderate-intensity exercise in females. It is suggested that the maintenance of a positive affective profile may be explained more by the level of hydration as opposed to fuel availability. Therefore, those seeking to use beverages containing CHO to enhance their exercise experience may take note of these findings as this practise appears unjustified.', 23455542: StringElement('This was to determine the sero-prevalence of hepatitis C viral (HCV) antibodies in pregnant women attending the first antenatal clinic and assess the epidemiologic correlates of women anti-HCV positive.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'OBJECTIVE', u'Label': u'PURPOSE'}), 557900: 'The effect of an educational program on the use of antibiotics was studied in a university-affiliated Veterans Administration Hospital.

In the past decade, research efforts have produced quantifiable risk-based safety margins for protection zones. These margins are based on well-vulnerability criteria (e.g., travel times, exposure times, peak concentrations) and take model and parameter uncertainty into account. There are three main reasons why practitioners still refrain from applying these new techniques. (1) They fear the additional areal demand of probabilistic safety margins; (2) probabilistic approaches are allegedly complex, not readily available and require huge computing resources, and (3) uncertainty bounds are fuzzy, whereas final decisions are binary. The primary goal of this paper is to show that these reservations are unjustified. We present a straightforward, computationally affordable framework that offers risk-informed decision support for robust and transparent wellhead delineation under uncertainty. We show that reliability levels can be increased by exchanging delineated low-risk areas for previously nondelineated high-risk areas.

The highest risk occurs in the trade of live birds. It is important to assess and manage these risks to ensure that global trade does not result in the dissemination of NAI. However, it is also important that the risk of infection is not used as an unjustified trade barrier. The role of the regulatory authorities is thus to facilitate the safe trade of animal products according to international guidelines. Nevertheless, the balance between acceptable risk and safe trade is difficult to achieve. Since the movements of poultry and birds are sometimes difficult to trace, the signature or 'identity card' of each isolated virus can be very informative. Indeed, sequencing the genes of H5N1 and other avian influenza viruses has assisted greatly in establishing links and highlighting differences between isolates from different countries and tracing the possible source of introduction. Recent examples from Asia, Europe and Africa, supported by H5N1 molecular fingerprinting, have demonstrated that the sources of introduction can be many and no route should be underestimated.\", 17470321: StringElement('Appendectomy is the most common non-elective surgery.

We studied a homogenous group of healthy, young, and fit military recruits to represent a cross section of our country's population. We analyzed all knee magnetic resonance images of soldiers who subsequently had primary arthroscopic knee surgery within a 3-month period from 1997-1998. The results were compared with surgical findings of four structures: medial meniscus, lateral meniscus, anterior cruciate ligament, and articular cartilage. Of the 1185 arthroscopies and 633 magnetic resonance images of the knee performed in 14 institutions, 139 paired magnetic resonance imaging arthroscopic reports met our inclusion criteria. The results showed a false positive rate of 65% for the medial meniscus, 43% for the lateral meniscus, 47.2% for the anterior cruciate ligament, and 41.7% for articular cartilage disease when compared with surgical findings.

However, all of these methods, even double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges (DBPCFC), may sometimes be misleading. This overview describes several pitfalls for standard diagnostic methods such as problems with irritative skin reactions mimicking IgE-mediated symptoms, the problem of non-IgE-mediated reactions, pitfalls arising from the way foods are prepared or processed, effects of the route of exposure, the role of augmentation factors lowering the threshold value for clinical reactions, the noncomparability of specific IgE decision points, the influence of the timing of diagnostic measures. In addition, the problem of alternative diagnostic measures is discussed. In conclusion, there are several pitfalls in the diagnostic work-up of food allergy, which may be misleading for the physician.

A cohort of 102 cows with on-farm surgical diagnostic of RDA or AV was obtained from June 2009 through December 2011. Blood was drawn from coccygeal vessels before surgery and plasma LAC was immediately measured by using a portable clinical analyzer. Dairy producers were interviewed by phone 30 d following surgery and the outcome was determined: a positive outcome if the owner was satisfied of the overall evolution 30 d postoperatively, and a negative outcome if the cow was culled, died, or if the owner reported being unsatisfied 30 d postoperatively. The area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve for LAC was 0.92 and was significantly greater than the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve of heart rate (HR; 0.77), indicating that LAC, in general, performed better than HR to predict a negative outcome. Furthermore, the ability to predict a negative outcome was significantly improved when LAC measurement was considered in addition to the already available HR data (area under the curve: 0.93 and 95% confidence interval: 0.87, 0.99). Important inflection points of the misclassification cost term function were noted at thresholds of 2 and 6 mmol/L, suggesting the potential utility of these cut-points. The 2 and 6 mmol/L thresholds had a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for predicting a negative outcome of 76.2, 82.7, 53.3, and 93.1%, and of 28.6, 97.5, 75, and 84%, respectively. In terms of clinical interpretation, LAC \\u22642 mmol/L appeared to be a good indicator of positive outcome and could be used to support a surgical treatment decision. The treatment decision for cows with LAC between 2 and 6 mmol/L, however, would depend on the economic context and the owner's attitude to risk in regard to potential return on its investment. Finally, performing a surgical correction on commercial cows with RDA or AV and a LAC \\u22656 mmol/L appeared to be unjustified and these animals should be culled based on their high probability of negative outcome.\", 15819657: \"Despite initiatives to raise the awareness of patient autonomy among healthcare providers, the use of physical restraints on frail or confused older patients continues to be a common practice in many healthcare settings.

This retrospective review evaluates the efficacy and usefulness of limited one-shot IVP in penetrating abdominal trauma patients who are suspected of having urological injuries. The charts of 40 patients with penetrating abdominal trauma who had one-shot IVP performed in the emergency room at presentation were reviewed. Of the total, 36 patients had gunshot wounds and only 4 patients had stab wounds. Mean Penetrating Abdominal Trauma Index was 15.7, with 47.5 per cent of patients in shock. Only 2 out of 10 urological injuries were detected by one-shot IVP. The positive predictive value of limited one-shot IVP was only 20 per cent, with sensitivity 25 per cent and specificity 76.2 per cent. The results of the one-shot IVP did not influence the decisions for laparotomy in any of the 35 (87.5%) patients who underwent exploratory laparotomy. In the two patients with positive one-shot IVPs who had urological injuries, the decision to operate was again determined by the presence of other associated intra-abdominal injuries. Eighty per cent of patients with normal one-shot IVP findings had renal injuries not detected by one-shot IVP, and 20 per cent of patients with abnormal IVP findings had no intraoperative evidence of renal injury. The presence of gross hematuria appeared to correlate with the presence of significant urological injuries. We therefore conclude that limited one-shot IVP is of no significant value in assessing penetrating abdominal trauma patients who subsequently undergo exploratory laparotomy for other associated intra-abdominal injuries, and indeed, the delay imposed, before definitive operative intervention in potentially unstable patients, is unjustified.', 3498137: 'Eleven percent of the 272 women aged 25-45 years admitted consecutively to a neurologic department in 1980-1984 had undergone hysterectomy. The population was divided into two groups according to the discharge diagnoses. Among women with discharge diagnoses usually associated with no objective neurologic findings, the frequency of hysterectomy was 14%, compared with 5.4% in women discharged with diagnoses indicating organic neurologic disease. Gynecologic and psychiatric admissions were more frequent in the former than in the latter group. Of the 30 hysterectomized women, only six had had malignant or premalignant changes in the uterus, whereas in 22 cases the removed organs had been normal. These results suggest that a somatization disorder might have been the underlying cause for the hysterectomy as well as for the symptoms and complaints leading to referral to the neurologic service.

Differences in levels of O6-guanine methylation produced by these alkylating agents, has been interpreted as indicating that O6-methylguanine is the DNA lesion specifically responsible for their mutagenic and carcinogenic effects. Because of the heterogeneity of molecular events which can result in forward mutation this conclusion seems unjustified. The development and characterisation of a reverse assay from 6-thioguanine resistance and HAT medium sensitivity (TG(R) and HAT(S)), to 6-thioguanine sensitivity and HAT medium resistance (TG(S) and HAT(R)) HGPRT(-)-->HGPRT+ in V79 cells, has allowed us to test the above hypothesis in a more specific way. Ethyl methane sulphonate, a weak carcinogen and MNU, both of which produce significant levels of O atom alkylation, were similarly effective mutagens in the reverse direction. At equitoxic doses, DMS was 40-60 fold less efficient. There was however, no quantitative correlation between numbers of revertants induced and measured levels of O6-alkylguanine. From these and other observations it is concluded that O6-alkylguanine is not the only potentially mutagenic lesion in mammalian cells.', 11193258: u'The census of cripples (\"Reichskr\\xfcppelz\\xe4hlung\") in the German Reich plays a central role in the development of orthopaedic surgery. Local censuses conducted by protestant ministers had already pointed out the great number of disabled children without appropriate care. It was the achievement of Konrad Biesalski, who was an orthopaedic surgeon, and of Eduard Dietrich, a Prussian government official, that a nation-wide census for disabled people was conducted. The concerns of the Reich-health-administration, which had complained about the way the survey was to be made, were neglected. These concerns were not all unjustified. Both the planning of the census itself and the technical interpretation of the obtained numbers were full of errors. The number of cripples in need of a place in an asylum were very exaggerated. Biesalski is to be held responsible for this systematic error. For him the census was only a way to influence the public opinion and had no scientific value. The public was worried by the great numbers of cripples in need of medical care and the foundation of asylums for cripples was added to the social political agenda. Along with these asylums came the promotion of orthopaedic surgery. The law, which laid the foundation for these institutions, the \"law for the welfare of the cripples in Prussia\" of 1920, would have never been passed, if it had not been for Biesalski\\'s manipulated numbers.

There is ongoing debate about the real burden of inappropriateness in laboratory diagnostics. The media coverage of this issue has also recently led to either over- or under-emphasizing the clinical, organizational and economic consequences. This is quite problematic, inasmuch as some reliable data are available in the current scientific literature, showing that inappropriateness of laboratory testing can be as high as 70%. This is especially evident for, though not limited to, cancer biomarkers testing, in which the practice of avoidable tests ordering is dramatically magnified. The reasons beyond inappropriateness are many and multifaceted, entailing wrong habits, resistance to changes, poor culture, insufficient education and healthcare inefficiencies. There are many unfavorable consequences attributable to avoidable testing, including unjustified incremental costs, derangement of laboratory efficiency and potential patient safety issues. The tentative solutions to this important problem necessitate that policymakers, local hospital administrators, laboratory professionals, clinicians, patients' associations and diagnostic companies join the efforts and embark in the same landmark effort for disseminating a better culture of appropriateness.\", 11994029: 'The long and growing list of non-antiarrhythmic drugs associated with prolongation of the QT interval of the electrocardiogram has generated concern not only for regulatory interventions leading to drug withdrawal, but also for the unjustified view that QT prolongation is usually an intrinsic effect of a whole therapeutic class [e.g. histamine H(1) receptor antagonists (antihistamines)], whereas, in many cases, it is displayed only by some compounds within a given class of non-antiarrhythmic drugs because of an effect on cardiac repolarisation. We provide an overview of the different classes of non-antiarrhythmic drugs reported to prolong the QT interval (e.g. antihistamines, antipsychotics, antidepressants and macrolides) and discusses the clinical relevance of the QT prolonging effect. Drug-induced torsade de pointes are sometimes considered idiosyncratic, totally unpredictable adverse drug reactions, whereas a number of risk factors for their occurrence is now recognised. Widespread knowledge of these risk factors and implementation of a comprehensive list of QT prolonging drugs becomes an important issue. Risk factors include congenital long QT syndrome, clinically significant bradycardia or heart disease, electrolyte imbalance (especially hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, hypocalcaemia), impaired hepatic/renal function, concomitant treatment with other drugs with known potential for pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic interactions (e.g. azole antifungals, macrolide antibacterials and class I or III antiarrhythmic agents). This review provides insight into the strategies that should be followed during a drug development program when a drug is suspected to affect the QT interval. The factors limiting the predictive value of preclinical and clinical studies are also outlined. The sensitivity of preclinical tests (i.e. their ability to label as positive those drugs with a real risk of inducing QT pronglation in humans) is sufficiently good, but their specificity (i.e. their ability to label as negative those drugs carrying no risk) is not well established. Verapamil is a notable example of a false positive: it blocks human ether-a-go-go-related (HERG) K(+) channels, but is reported to have little potential to trigger torsade de pointes. Although inhibition of HERG K(+) channels has been proposed as a primary test for screening purposes, it is important to remember that several ion currents are involved in the generation of the cardiac potential and that metabolites must be specifically tested in this in vitro test. At the present state of knowledge, no preclinical model has an absolute predictive value or can be considered as a gold standard. Therefore, the use of several models facilitates decision making and is recommended by most experts in the field.', 11723698: 'Clinical guidelines are being developed for the purpose of reducing medical errors and unjustified variations in medical practice, and for basing medical practice on evidence. Encoding guidelines in a computer-interpretable format and integrating them with the electronic medical record can enable delivery of patient-specific recommendations when and where needed. Since great effort must be expended in developing high-quality guidelines, and in making them computer-interpretable, it is highly desirable to be able to share computer-interpretable guidelines (CIGs) among institutions. Adoption of a common format for representing CIGs is one approach to sharing. Factors that need to be considered in creating a format for sharable CIGs include (i) the scope of guidelines and their intended applications, (ii) the method of delivery of the recommendations, and (iii) the environment, consisting of the practice setting and the information system in which the guidelines will be applied. Several investigators have proposed solutions that improve the sharability of CIGs and, more generally, of medical knowledge. These approaches can be useful in the development of a format for sharable CIGs. Challenges in sharing CIGs also include the need to extend the traditional framework for disseminating guidelines to enable them to be integrated into practice.

Data from the 2007 National Immunization Survey showed that 90% of children 19 to 35 months of age have received recommended doses of each of the following vaccines: inactivated poliovirus (IPV), measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), varicella-zoster virus (VZB), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). For diphtheria and tetanus and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine, 84.5% have received the recommended 4 doses by 35 months of age. Nevertheless, the Healthy People 2010 goal of at least 80% coverage for the full series (at least 4 doses of DTaP, 3 doses of IPV, 1 dose of MMR, 3 doses of Hib, 3 doses of HBV, and 1 dose of varicella-zoster virus vaccine) has not yet been met, and immunization coverage of adolescents continues to lag behind the goals set forth in Healthy People 2010. Despite these encouraging data, a vast number of new challenges that threaten continued success toward the goal of universal immunization coverage have emerged. These challenges include an increase in new vaccines and new vaccine combinations as well as a significant number of vaccines currently under development; a dramatic increase in the acquisition cost of vaccines, coupled with a lack of adequate payment to practitioners to buy and administer vaccines; unanticipated manufacturing and delivery problems that have caused significant shortages of various vaccine products; and the rise of a public antivaccination movement that uses the Internet as well as standard media outlets to advance a position, wholly unsupported by any scientific evidence, linking vaccines with various childhood conditions, particularly autism.

It takes the recent public discussion about 800&emsp14;m runner Caster Semenya as a starting point. At the World Championships in Athletics 2009 in Berlin, Germany, Semenya was challenged by competitors as being a so called 'sex impostor'. A medical examination to verify her sex ensued. The author analyses whether athletes like Semenya could claim a right not to know that is generally acknowledged in human genetics and enforced by international and national genetic privacy laws. The relevance of this right for genetic diagnosis in sports is discussed. To this end, the interests of the athlete concerned and of third parties are balanced according to the expected benefits and harms.Harm is documented in a number of cases and includes unjustified disqualification, severe sex and gender identity crisis, demeaning reactions, social isolation, depression and suicide. Benefits are dubious as most cases of intersex are considered irrelevant for sports competition. It has to be concluded that the benefits to be gained from 'gender verification' in sports via genetic testing do not outweigh the grave individual disadvantages.

However, the danger, now as then, is that in the search for improvement, comparative measures of mortality and morbidity are often overinterpreted, resulting in judgments about the underlying quality of care. Such judgments can translate into performance management strategies in the form of capricious sanctions (such as star ratings) and unjustified rewards (such as special freedoms or financial allocations). The resulting risk of stigmatising an entire institution injects huge tensions into health-care organisations and can divert attention from genuine improvement towards superficial improvement or even gaming behaviour (ie, manipulating the system). These dangers apply particularly to measures of outcome and throughput. We argue that comparative outcome data (league tables) should not be used by external agents to make judgments about quality of hospital care. Although they might provide a reasonable measure of quality in some high-risk surgical situations, they have little validity in acute medical settings. Their use to support a system of reward and punishment is unfair and, unsurprisingly, often resisted by clinicians and managers.

(4) Finally, as an added benefit, there was a 60% reduction in expenditures for lost time and replacement wages, resulting in a cumulative ten-year savings of more than 4.1 million dollars. The program accomplished the goal of ensuring quality care in a prospective concurrent fashion. As an additional benefit, the program also reduced unjustified lost time and compensation costs through early functional return, efficient use of diagnostic studies, and avoidance of surgery whenever possible. Future emphasis on health-care delivery in the workers' compensation setting should concentrate on high-quality medical care, which will, in turn, lead to secondary cost savings.\", 20462571: 'Quality Design Activities of Good Clinical Practice guidelines or protocols and clinical pathways (CP) include those clinical plans intended for the patients with a particular disease. They must be based on the clinical evidence, the analysis of the process, and the consensus of the professionals involved in the care of the patient.

In fact we are speaking quality design activities with the same objectives of decreasing the unjustified variability and helping in the decision making on a specific clinical problem.

Due to the lack of BSE-positive control samples, however, full assay validation at the level of individual test runs and continuous monitoring of test performance on-site is difficult. Most rapid tests use synthetic prion protein peptides, but it is not known to which extend they reflect the assay performance on field samples, and whether they are sufficient to indicate on-site assay quality problems. To address this question we compared the test scores of the provided kit peptide controls to those of standardized weak BSE-positive tissue samples in individual test runs as well as continuously over time by quality control charts in two widely used BSE rapid tests. Our results reveal only a weak correlation between the weak positive tissue control and the peptide control scores. We identified kit-lot related shifts in the assay performances that were not reflected by the peptide control scores. Vice versa, not all shifts indicated by the peptide control scores indeed reflected a shift in the assay performance. In conclusion these data highlight that the use of the kit peptide controls for continuous quality control purposes may result in unjustified rejection or acceptance of test runs. However, standardized weak positive tissue controls in combination with Shewhart-CUSUM control charts appear to be reliable in continuously monitoring assay performance on-site to identify undesired deviations.', 12145491: 'In their sections on mood disorders, both ICD-10 and DSM-IV represent considerable advances on ICD-9 in drawing affective disorders together in one section, distinguishing bipolar disorder from unipolar, including dysthymia and using clear definitions. Problems with ICD-10 include complexity, use of different clinical and research definitions, emphasis on single versus recurrent episodes and the lack of some clinically useful subtypes. DSM-IV is less complex but assigns separate unjustified categories of medical and substance-induced mood disorders, and fails to code its useful qualifiers. Both classifications preserve categories for psychotic depression and melancholia/somatic syndrome, which are better coded in ICD-10. The severity distinctions could usefully be extended to a milder category of minor depression. It is also recommended that the two classifications be brought together, with small differences in definitions ironed out and a single set used both clinically and for research, the simpler DSM-IV organisation, the omission of the categorisations of single versus recurrent and mood disorder due to general medical or substance abuse disorders, and the inclusion of coding for some subtypes such as seasonal and postpartum.', 1297400: 'After thousands of painful long-lasting migraine or extremely violent cluster headache attacks no one has yet traced histological inflammatory or degenerative alterations of the interested tissues able to explain such dreadful pain. Therefore it has seemed logical to include these pains among the unjustified aimless, non finalized types of pain. Furthermore, clinical characteristics of automatism, explosiveness and the course of these pains resemble other aimless pains like those of organic deafferentation (phantom pain) which appear in a desensitized limb after denervation or even in amputated subjects. Intense and long lasting pains in opioid abstinence, mainly located in the chest and in the hip, also have all the characteristics of aimless pain. Idiopathic cephalic pain, together with deafferentation or opioid-abstinence pain, seems to be due to a dysafferentation which, through different channels, follows an analogous mechanism. This mechanism seems to be due to a deficit of autoanalgesia which in both organic deafferentation (phantom limb) and in opioid-abstinence can be related to the disuse of afferences\\' modulation. In idiopathic headache such a failure of autoanalgesia is likely to be due to a genetic, idiopathic mechanism. Headaches are characterized by a clear deficiency of autoanalgesia which may manifest itself not only at the level of the cephalic segment, which is so rich in afferences, but it may even involve the whole body. Even if pain is the compulsory phenomenon to diagnose headache, one must consider that migraine is a symptomatic triad in which vegetative and emotional phenomena also emerge. These phenomena are interindependent and not interdependent as each of them may appear as a first manifestation of an attack; one must therefore consider the possibility of a \"unicum movens\". Serotonin was taken into consideration because of its action which interests all or nearly all vegetative-emotional pain transmitting pathways. Today\\'s identification of four types and various sub-types of 5-HT receptors has revealed the extraordinary eclecticism of this transmitter which within migraine\\'s clinical expression underscores that migraine sufferers are characterized by a marked sensitivity to all the drugs capable of acutely or chronically interacting with serotonin metabolism and binding with many serotonin receptor types and sub-types. So even if the migraine sphinx still proposes its enigma, researchers--with their incurable curiosity--may not only find more and more accurate and effective medication for many human beings but also start penetrating a mystery, a great challenge to human imagination.', 18020863: '1,2 dimethylhydrazine (DMH) rat model has been proven to be a valuable animal model of colorectal cancer. Because of its morphological similarity to human colorectal cancer, DMH rat model was used to produce information in histology and biochemistry of tumours development as well as on factors that retard or enhance tumorigenesis. Nevertheless, it has been shown that DMH model has limitations, which raise the question, whether experiments evaluating effect of ethanol on DMH model are ethically justified. In this paper authors summarize experimental results evaluating effect of ethanol consumption on DMH rat model with aim to prevent unnecessary duplication of animal experimentation or execution of ethically unjustified animal experiments in the future and to warn scientists that results from studies evaluating ethanol on DMH rat model can not be generalized to humans.', 736254: 'Topic adrenaline with cocaine has been used commonly for intranasal vasoconstriction to facilitate surgery and to control haemorrhage. Pharmacologically the drug combination is known to be a potentially dangerous interaction. This investigation studied whether either drug could be used separately rather than in combination, to achieve the same purposes. One hundred cases were randomized into four groups using 1:1000 Adrenaline, 5% Cocaine, 10% Cocaine and 5% Cocaine/1:1000 Adrenaline as the topical vasoconstriction regimes. The results showed that the vasoconstrictor effect was not significantly different within the four groups; topical 1:1000 Adrenaline resulted in more haemorrhage compared to the other three regimes; comparing the other three regimes the blood loss was not significantly different. The conclusion is that the Adrenaline/Cocaine mixture has no advantage and its potentially dangerous interaction makes it unnecessary and unjustified. Topical 5% Cocaine is recommended because it achieves the aims with the least side-effects.', 3048455: 'Antacids have served us well for over a century. The attitude in the late 1950s to 1970s that antacids should be taken only on demand was unjustified and was based on what can be seen nowadays as misinterpretation of scientific data. Twelve recent endoscopic controlled studies have confirmed the efficacy of antacids in the healing of duodenal ulcer, achieving about 75% healing in 4 weeks. Like H2-receptor antagonists, the efficacy of antacids in the healing of gastric ulcers is controversial, most probably related to the even greater pathogenetic heterogeneity of this condition. Antacids should be given at least four times a day and at least 1 hour after meals, since their therapeutic success most likely depends on neutralization of postprandial acid secretion. In vivo, the newer tablet forms are indistinguishable from the liquid forms in terms of neutralizing efficiency and healing efficacy. The ideal dose is one that neutralizes 400 mmol of acid. Combination with an anticholinergic drug is effective and a recent report suggests that this may lead to longer remission than with H2-receptor antagonists. As a long-term therapy, antacids appear to work but need to be taken in multiple daily doses, a regimen which is unlikely to meet with long-term patient compliance. The success of antacids in duodenal ulcer healing should alert us to the importance of controlling the meal-stimulated acid secretion in ulcer therapy, and to the hard fact that acid is a non-permissive factor in ulcer healing.', 23540744: u'Cardiotoxicity due to cancer treatment is of rising concern, for both cardiologists and oncologists, because it may have a significant impact on cancer patient management and outcome. The most typical manifestation of cardiotoxicity is a hypokinetic cardiomyopathy leading to heart failure. However, the spectrum of the toxic effects that can impair the cardiovascular system may also include acute coronary syndromes, hypertension, arrhythmias, and thromboembolic events. Patients undergoing cancer treatment are more vulnerable to cardiovascular injuries, and their risk of premature cardiovascular disease and death is higher than that of the general population. Prevention of cardiotoxicity remains the most important strategy, and several measures, including cardiac function monitoring, limitation of chemotherapy dose, use of anthracycline analogues and cardioprotectants, and early detection of myocardial cell injury by biomarkers, have been proposed. The response to modern heart failure therapy of cancer treatment-induced cardiomyopathy has never been evaluated in clinical trials, and currently there are no definitive guidelines. Although it is likely that medications used for other forms of cardiomyopathy, particularly angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and \\u03b2-blockers, may be highly effective, there is still some unjustified concern regarding their use in cancer patients. Specific guidelines that take cardiologic conditions of cancer patients into account are currently lacking and need to be developed.', 8614922: StringElement('Effective methods to monitor length of stay can help reduce unnecessary hospital stay without adversely affecting the quality of care.

While the contribution of diffusion is well understood, the influence of density gradient-driven natural convection on the mass transport in electrochemical systems is not. To date, it has been assumed to be relevant only for high concentrations of redox-active species and at long experimental time scales. If unjustified, this assumption risks misinterpretation of analytical data obtained from scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) and generator-collector experiments, as well as analytical sensors utilizing macroelectrodes/microelectrode arrays. It also affects the results expected from electrodeposition. On the basis of numerical simulation, herein it is demonstrated that even at less than 10 mM concentrations and short experimental times of tens of seconds, density gradient-driven natural convection significantly affects mass transport. This is evident from in-depth numerical simulation for the oxidation of hexacyanoferrate (II) at various electrode sizes and electrode orientations. In each case, the induced convection and its influence on the diffusion layer established near the electrode are illustrated by maps of the velocity fields and concentration distributions evolving with time. The effects of natural convection on mass transport and chronoamperometric currents are thus quantified and discussed for the different cases studied.', 28626435: 'Scientific evidence has recently been used to assert that certain psychological phenomena do not exist. Such claims, however, cannot be made because (1) scientific method itself is seriously limited (i.e., it can never prove a negative); (2) non-existence of phenomena would require a complete absence of both logical (theoretical) and empirical support; even if empirical support is weak, logical and theoretical support can be strong; (3) statistical data are only one piece of evidence and cannot be used to reduce psychological phenomena to statistical phenomena; and (4) psychological phenomena vary across time, situations and persons. The human mind is unreproducible from one situation to another. Psychological phenomena are not particles that can decisively be tested and discovered. Therefore, a declaration that a phenomenon is not real is not only theoretically and empirically unjustified but runs counter to the propositional and provisional nature of scientific knowledge. There are only \"temporary winners\" and no \"final truths\" in scientific knowledge. Psychology is a science of subtleties in human affect, cognition and behavior. Its phenomena fluctuate with conditions and may sometimes be difficult to detect and reproduce empirically. When strictly applied, reproducibility is an overstated and even questionable concept in psychological science. Furthermore, statistical measures (e.g., effect size) are poor indicators of the theoretical importance and relevance of phenomena (cf. \"deliberate practice\" vs. \"talent\" in expert performance), not to mention whether phenomena are real or unreal. To better understand psychological phenomena, their theoretical and empirical properties should be examined via multiple parameters and criteria. Ten such parameters are suggested.', 29535253: \"The present paper scrutinises the European authorities' assessment of the carcinogenic hazard posed by glyphosate based on Regulation (EC) 1272/2008. We use the authorities' own criteria as a benchmark to analyse their weight of evidence (WoE) approach. Therefore, our analysis goes beyond the comparison of the assessments made by the European Food Safety Authority and the International Agency for Research on Cancer published by others. We show that not classifying glyphosate as a carcinogen by the European authorities, including the European Chemicals Agency, appears to be not consistent with, and in some instances, a direct violation of the applicable guidance and guideline documents. In particular, we criticise an arbitrary attenuation by the authorities of the power of statistical analyses; their disregard of existing dose-response relationships; their unjustified claim that the doses used in the mouse carcinogenicity studies were too high and their contention that the carcinogenic effects were not reproducible by focusing on quantitative and neglecting qualitative reproducibility. Further aspects incorrectly used were historical control data, multisite responses and progression of lesions to malignancy. Contrary to the authorities' evaluations, proper application of statistical methods and WoE criteria inevitably leads to the conclusion that glyphosate is 'probably carcinogenic' (corresponding to category 1B in the European Union).\", 25748506: 'The consumption of mineral water has been increasing because of the frequent and unjustified reports of the water supply contamination.

Especially in targeted and non-targeted profiling approaches, including metabolomics analysis, these objectives are not easy to achieve; however, robust and reproducible measurements and low coefficients of variation (CV) are crucial for successful metabolomics approaches. Nevertheless, all efforts from the analysts are in vain if the sample quality is poor, i.e. if preanalytical errors are made by the partner during sample collection. Preanalytical risks and errors are more common than expected, even when standard operating procedures (SOP) are used. This risk is particularly high in clinical studies, and poor sample quality may heavily bias the CV of the final analytical results, leading to disappointing outcomes of the study and consequently, although unjustified, to critical questions about the analytical performance of the approach from the partner who provided the samples.

Major causes of polytherapy include the presence of multiple disease states, thereby necessitating multiple drug therapy, particularly in patients with chronic debilitating disorders; increasing demand for health care; therapeutic advances as well as excessive prescribing (which may be related to poor coordination between practitioners). Polypharmacy may result in: increased rates of adverse drug reactions, as a frequent consequence of drug-drug interactions; errors in medication-taking, including poor compliance due to drug-associated untoward effects and medication errors; both direct and indirect additional costs for the health insurance scheme.

In animals, acute alcohol loading inhibits toxic metabolic activation of paracetamol whilst chronic alcohol administration results in cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2E1 induction with increased toxic metabolic activation of paracetamol by CYP2E1 and increased hepatotoxicity. However, due to species differences in CYP expression, activity and induction, it is not possible extrapolate the results of these animal studies to clinical situations in humans. Isoenzymes are also responsible for the metabolic activation of paracetamol in humans and human studies to date have not convincingly demonstrated increased toxic metabolic activation of paracetamol in patients with chronic alcoholism. Acute alcohol ingestion at the time of a paracetamol overdose is probably protective and the timing and chronicity of alcohol intake is therefore crucial in the interpretation of the effects of alcohol on paracetamol overdose. One of the problems in the interpretation of the literature to date is that insufficient information is available on the timing of alcohol intake in relation to the ingestion of paracetamol. Whilst it is possible that chronic exposure to excessive amounts of alcohol does predispose patients with paracetamol overdose to hepatotoxicity, a critical review of the literature reveals that the evidence to date does not support this. A prospective, controlled study is required.

Cells from individuals with FA show a pronounced sensitivity to DNA interstrand crosslink (ICL)-inducing agents, which manifests as G2-M arrest, chromosomal aberrations and reduced cellular survival. To date, mutations in at least 15 different genes have been identified that cause FA; the products of all of these genes are thought to function together in the FA pathway, which is essential for ICL repair. Rapidly following the discovery of FA genes, mutant mice were generated to study the disease and the affected pathway. These mutant mice all show the characteristic cellular ICL-inducing agent sensitivity, but only partially recapitulate the developmental abnormalities, anaemia and cancer predisposition seen in individuals with FA. Therefore, the usefulness of modelling FA in mice has been questioned. In this Review, we argue that such scepticism is unjustified. We outline that haematopoietic defects and cancer predisposition are manifestations of FA gene defects in mice, albeit only in certain genetic backgrounds and under certain conditions. Most importantly, recent work has shown that developmental defects in FA mice also arise with concomitant inactivation of acetaldehyde metabolism, giving a strong clue about the nature of the endogenous lesion that must be repaired by the functional FA pathway. This body of work provides an excellent example of a paradox in FA research: that the dissimilarity, rather than the similarity, between mice and humans can provide insight into human disease. We expect that further study of mouse models of FA will help to uncover the mechanistic background of FA, ultimately leading to better treatment options for the disease.', 23841891: 'The exquisitely sensitive single antigen bead (SAB) technique was shown to detect human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies in sera of healthy male blood donors.

We tested pretransplant sera of 534 patients on the kidney waiting list using complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and SAB in parallel. Evidence of HLA antibodies was obtained in 5% of patients using CDC, 14% using ELISA, and 81% using SAB.

High-MFI-value antibodies were found in some of these patients with HLA specificities that are rather common in general population, consideration of which would lead to unjustified exclusion of potential kidney donors.

Furthermore, IL-17A antigen is undetectable in LCH lesion lysates with western blotting, immunoprecipitation, spectral analysis, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Western blots, immunoprecipitation, and ELISA experiments also demonstrate that antibodies used in original studies that established the IL-17A hypothesis for pathogenesis of LCH recognize nonspecific proteins.

Following a quality-of-use review of all consecutive courses of antimicrobial drugs prescribed during four weeks, an educational program was conducted and an antibiotic order form introduced. After four years, an identical review was performed. In the first review, 109 (31%) of 347 patients were prescribed antimicrobial drugs. Only 40% of the prescriptions were considered definitely appropriate, and 13% were considered unjustified. There was a certain degree of underutilization, and only 67% of clinical isolates were susceptible to empirical therapy. In the review performed after intervention, 164 (21%) of 796 patients were given antimicrobial drugs. Defined daily doses per 100 bed days increased from 59.8 to 72.6. Fifty-three percent of the prescriptions were judged optimal, and only 9% were judged unjustified. Ninety percent of the clinical isolates were susceptible to empirical therapy. After one year, compliance with the antibiotic order forms on a voluntary basis reached 77%, documenting 86% of antimicrobial drug costs. As a result, the antibiotic order form will be useful for surveillance, if logistic support is provided by the pharmacy. The combination of several measures leads to improved quality of use. As correctly predicted by the first evaluation, improvement in quality resulted in increased drug consumption by fewer patients and a higher cost per bed day.', 25726430: StringElement(\"Systematic reviews of literature are increasingly important in healthcare.

No important differences are clearly apparent among the benefits of different beta blockers, although some are more convenient than others (or have slightly fewer side effects), and it appears that those with appreciable intrinsic sympathomimetic activity may confer less benefit. If monitored, the side effects of long-term therapy are not a major problem, as when they occur they are easily reversible by changing the beta blocker or by discontinuation of treatment. By contrast, although very early IV short-term beta blockade can definitely limit infarct size, more reliable information about the effects of such treatment on mortality will not be available until a large trial (ISIS) reports later this year, with data on some thousands of patients entered within less than 4 hours of the onset of pain. Our aim has been not only to review the 65-odd randomized beta blocker trials but also to demonstrate that when many randomized trials have all applied one general approach to treatment, it is often not appropriate to base inference on individual trial results. Although there will usually be important differences from one trial to another (in eligibility, treatment, end-point assessment, and so on), physicians who wish to decide whether to adopt a particular treatment policy should try to make their decision in the light of an overview of all these related randomized trials and not just a few particular trial results. Although most trials are too small to be individually reliable, this defect of size may be rectified by an overview of many trials, as long as appropriate statistical methods are used. Fortunately, robust statistical methods exist--based on direct, unweighted summation of one O-E value from each trial--that are simple for physicians to use and understand yet provide full statistical sensitivity. These methods allow combination of information from different trials while avoiding the unjustified direct comparison of patients in one trial with patients in another. (Moreover, they can be extended of such data that there is no real need for the introduction of any more complex statistical methods that might be more difficult for physicians to trust.) Their robustness, sensitivity, and avoidance of unnecessary complexity make these particular methods an important tool in trial overviews.', 23315587: 'Hospitals around the world are under increasing pressure to optimize the economic efficiency of treatment processes. Imaging is responsible for a great part of the success but also of the costs of treatment. In routine work an excessive supply of imaging methods leads to an \"as well as\" strategy up to the limit of the capacity without critical reflection. Exams that have no predictable influence on the clinical outcome are an unjustified burden for the patient. They are useless and threaten the financial situation and existence of the hospital. In recent years the focus of process optimization was exclusively on the quality and efficiency of performed single examinations. In the future critical discussion of the effectiveness of single exams in relation to the clinical outcome will be more important. Unnecessary exams can be avoided, only if in addition to the optimization of single exams (efficiency) there is an optimization strategy for the total imaging process (efficiency and effectiveness). This requires a new definition of processes (Imaging Pathway), new structures for organization (Imaging Center) and a new kind of thinking on the part of the medical staff.

Taking into account these standards, the two main tasks of prison physicians in Germany are the following: 1.) Prison physicians have to treat and, if possible, cure patients--just as physicians outside the prisons do. 2.) By expressing their opinion and by taking initiatives, prison physicians have to contribute, to the observance of health standards in connection with the determination of confinement conditions (hygiene, cleanliness, physical exercise, ventilation, nutrition) and to develop them further. They also have to raise the prisoners' awareness of the fact that they should care about their health. These tasks are differentiated from requests that are unduly made to prison physicians by external authorities. Prison physicians are not court experts and the duties which they have to perform as physicians in charge of the treatment of prisoners do not include the rendering of opinions on questions relating to a person's fitness to undergo detention or to stand trial. This task is incumbent on experts, whom the courts have to find and appoint elsewhere than among prison physicians. Decisions regarding the determination of specific confinement conditions in a particular case or the granting of privileges to prisoners have to be taken by the prisons' managerial staff or the administration and not by the prison physicians, who, however, are frequently called in either by prisoners for the purpose of asserting alleged claims or by the prisons' managerial staff for the purpose of rejecting claims which the staff regard as unjustified.\", 27497610: u'Intravenous (IV) thrombolysis is the treatment in ischemic stroke, but only the minority of patients receive this medication.

The Vision Amniotic Leak Detector (ALD) is a panty liner that can diagnose amniotic fluid as a cause of vaginal wetness. It was evaluated by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as part of the Medical Technologies Evaluation Programme. The sponsor (CommonSense Ltd) identified five studies, of which three were deemed within scope by the External Assessment Centre (EAC). Two of these three used an inappropriate comparator. The EAC recalculated the diagnostic accuracy of Vision ALD using speculum examination as the comparator: sensitivity of 97% (95% CI 93-99%), negative predictive value of 96% (95% CI 92-98%). A negative result would therefore allow patients to be discharged with confidence. In the sponsor's cost-consequence model only patients with a positive Vision ALD result would have a speculum examination, producing a cost saving of around \\xa310 per patient.

The most frequent complications of this arrhythmia are thromboembolic events, primarly ischemic stroke. In comparison with patients in sinus rhythm, stroke affected nAF patients have more severe clinical course and significantly higher mortality rate, and the survivors have significantly lower recovery rate and more serious permanent mental and physical impairments. The administration of anticoagulants to patients with nAF significantly reduces the incidence of stroke, while those who were stroke affected during the anticoagulant therapy show better treatment outcomes. Therefore, professional associations guidelines recommend the anticoagulant treatment for the majority of patients with nAF. The fear of bleeding caused by anticoagulants results in their frequently unjustified omission from the therapy in patients with high thromboembolic risk.

To examine different parameters, the kinetics of killing and regrowth of Escherichia coli (MIC, 0.013 microg/ml) were studied in vitro by simulating a series of ciprofloxacin monoexponential pharmacokinetic profiles. Initial ciprofloxacin concentrations varied from 0.02 to 19.2 microg/ml, whereas the half-life of 4 h was the same in all experiments. The following parameters were calculated and estimated: the time to reduce the initial inoculum (N0) 10-, 100-, and 1,000-fold (T90%, T99%, and T99.9%, respectively), the rate constant of bacterial elimination (k(elb)), the nadir level (Nmin) in the viable count (N)-versus-time (t) curve, the time to reach Nmin (t(min)), the numbers of bacteria that survived (Ntau) by the end of the observation period (tau), the area under the bacterial killing and regrowth curve (log N(A)-t curve) from the zero point (time zero) to tau (AUBC), the area above this curve (AAC), the area between the control growth curve (log N(C)-t curve) and the bacterial killing and regrowth curve (log N(A)-t curve) from the zero point to tau (ABBC) or to the time point when log N(A) reaches the maximal values observed in the log N(C)-t curve (I(E); intensity of the effect), and the time shift between the control growth and regrowth curves (T(E); duration of the effect). Being highly sensitive to the AUC, I(E), and T(E) showed the most regular AUC relationships: the effect expressed by I(E) or T(E) increased systematically when the AUC or initial concentration of ciprofloxacin rose. Other parameters, especially T90%, T99%, T99.9%, t(min), and log N0 - log Nmin = delta log Nmin, related to the AUC less regularly and were poorly sensitive to the AUC. T(E) proved to be the best predictor and t(min) proved to be the worst predictor of the total antimicrobial effect reflected by I(E). Distinct feedback relationships between the effect determination and the experimental design were demonstrated. It was shown that unjustified shortening of the observation period, i.e., cutting off the log N(A)-t curves, may lead to the degeneration of the AUC-response relationships, as expressed by log N0 - log Ntau = delta log Ntau, AUBC, AAC, or ABBC, to a point where it gives rise to the false idea of an AUC- or concentration-independent effect. Thus, use of I(E) and T(E) provides the most unbiased, robust, and comprehensive means of determining the antimicrobial effect.', 14574768: 'A population of 9974 healthy male subjects (aged 15-45 years) was screened for congenital dyschromatopsia.

The ERG report is based on the manufacturer's submission (MS) to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence as part of the single technology appraisal process. In the submission, quality-of-life data [Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life (PAC-QOL) and Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms (PAC-SYM) questionnaires] from trials of prucalopride were extrapolated to EQ-5D (European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions) data and used to inform effectiveness in an economic model. Response rates to prucalopride were derived from observed response rates in trials, defined as the proportion of patients achieving an average of three or more spontaneous complete bowel movements over the 4- or 12-week trial periods. Adult (18-64 years) and elderly (\\u2265 65 years) patients were considered separately in the model. Cost-effectiveness was determined from estimated improvements in EQ-5D and anticipated response rates, adjusted for baseline severity of chronic constipation. The ERG considered that the patients participating in these trials were not representative of those in the licensed indication. They were not all refractory to laxatives, and baseline EQ-5D scores showed a large spread in quality of life, with many patients experiencing little baseline dissatisfaction. The mapping of quality-of-life data from trials (PAC-QOL and PAC-SYM data) to EQ-5D was unclear and invalidated. The assumption of the long-term effectiveness and safety of prucalopride to 1 year was considered unjustified. There was no justification or sources given for coefficients used to predict effectiveness in the economic model, and no costs other than the cost of prucalopride were incorporated into the model. Owing to the many areas of uncertainty, particularly the effectiveness of prucalopride in the licensed patient group and its long-term effectiveness and safety, it was considered that the MS provided no evidence for whether prucalopride is effective or not in women with laxative-refractory chronic constipation. Further subgroup analysis of the actual patient group of interest may have better guided decision-making.

It will be difficult to avoid labeling like \"May contain peanuts\" used with and without reason. In the long run, unjustified warnings will not help the allergic consumer but will create more confusion than guidance.', 6692073: 'The strategy of high-dose intramuscular haloperidol as routinely applied in a general hospital psychiatric ward to 74 successive patients, 33 of whom stayed only up to seven days, and a further 34 up to 15 days, led to a complete recovery in only six, and complete lack of change in 23.

In 2000, the number of breast cancer deaths in female was 9,171. In 1996, the aged adjusted incidence rate of breast cancer was 38.9, top among all of female cancers and the estimated number of female breast cancer patients was 29,448 in Japan. Therefore, efficient breast cancer screening system is urgently needed. In April 2000, breast screening using biennial mammography in combination with clinical breast examination instead of annual clinical breast examination alone was introduced for women aged 50 and over in Japan. However, the compliance of screening using mammography was less than 1% in the fiscal 2000 year. On the other hand, the compliance of screening with clinical breast examination alone was 6.5% in same period. These compliances were significantly lower than that of about 65% in the USA. Given the importance of the control of quality in screening mammography, a central committee for the quality control of mammographic screening has been established in order to educate doctors and radiographers and to assess image apparatus in each facility. As of April 2002, 1,409 out of 1,978 doctors that participated in the training program had obtained either grade A (instructor level) or grade B (adequate level). G\\xf8tzche and Olsen reassessed previous meta-analyses of screening mammography and concluded that screening for breast cancer with mammography was unjustified. Subsequently, reviews by U. S. Preventive Services Task Forces and the WHO reconfirmed the effectiveness of screening mammography in reducing breast cancer mortality. These controversies show the importance of assessment of screening mammography effectiveness in Japan.', 18240752: \"Food allergy is not the primary cause ofatopic dermatitis. This is illustrated in 3 patients with atopic dermatitis, a girl aged 6 months and 2 boys aged 6 and 7 months, respectively, who were referred to our outpatient clinic for evaluation for possible food allergies. All 3 patients were receiving hypoallergenic formula because their parents or health care providers suspected that the atopic dermatitis was caused by a cows' milk allergy. After sufficient explanation of the causes of atopic dermatitis and thorough clarification and use of topical therapy, a remarkable improvement in the severity of the atopic dermatitis was noted. Only 1 patient was allergic to cows' milk as confirmed by a double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge, but there was no association with the level of eczema activity. It is a common misconception that food allergies and atopic dermatitis are always causally related. In recent years it has become clear that atopic dermatitis may result from defective skin barrier function, for which topical treatment is essential. Unjustified focus on food allergies as the primary cause ofatopic dermatitis increases the risk of unnecessary elimination diets and malnutrition. Only infants with acute allergic symptoms directly related to ingestion, i.e. urticaria and gastrointestinal symptoms, should be evaluated for food allergies by a double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge.\", 29486321: 'Oxytocin (OT) is an endogenous neuropeptide that, while originally thought to promote trust, has more recently been found to be context-dependent. Here we extend experimental paradigms previously restricted to de novo decision-to-trust, to a more realistic environment in which social relationships evolve in response to iterative feedback over twenty interactions. In a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled within-subject/crossover experiment of human adult males, we investigated the effects of a single dose of intranasal OT (40 IU) on Bayesian expectation updating and reinforcement learning within a social context, with associated brain circuit dynamics. Subjects participated in a neuroeconomic task (Iterative Trust Game) designed to probe iterative social learning while their brains were scanned using ultra-high field (7T) fMRI. We modeled each subject\\'s behavior using Bayesian updating of belief-states (\"willingness to trust\") as well as canonical measures of reinforcement learning (learning rate, inverse temperature). Behavioral trajectories were then used as regressors within fMRI activation and connectivity analyses to identify corresponding brain network functionality affected by OT. Behaviorally, OT reduced feedback learning, without bias with respect to positive versus negative reward. Neurobiologically, reduced learning under OT was associated with muted communication between three key nodes within the reward circuit: the orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, and lateral (limbic) habenula. Our data suggest that OT, rather than inspiring feelings of generosity, instead attenuates the brain\\'s encoding of prediction error and therefore its ability to modulate pre-existing beliefs. This effect may underlie OT\\'s putative role in promoting what has typically been reported as \\'unjustified trust\\' in the face of information that suggests likely betrayal, while also resolving apparent contradictions with regard to OT\\'s context-dependent behavioral effects.', 16909565: 'It has been suggested that transgenics and vertebrate cloning have a role to play in conservation. Now is the time to evaluate their risks and benefits, before these technologies are widely implemented in our field. Direct risks of transgenics include escape and introgression of transgenes into wild populations; weedy invasion by transgenic organisms; toxicity or pathogenicity of engineered organisms and their products; and human error in the field testing and tracking of transgenic organisms. Indirect risks include environmental effects of increased herbicide use; the danger that engineered organisms may aid the development of bioweapons; the likelihood that gene patenting will lead to the privatization of natural resources; and the diversion of support from less glamorous forms of conservation. Formal risk assessments are commonly used to evaluate transgenic procedures, but our incomplete understanding of both ecosystem processes and the action of transgenes renders most of these assessments scientifically and socially unjustified. Nevertheless, a few, low-risk applications of transgenics may be possible: for example, \"super-sterile\" ornamental cultivars. Vertebrate cloning poses little risk to the environment, but it can consume scarce conservation resources, and its chances of success in preserving species seem poor To date, the conservation benefits of transgenics and vertebrate cloning remain entirely theoretical, but many of the risks are known and documented. Conservation biologists should devote their research and energies to the established methods of conservation, none of which require transgenics or vertebrate cloning.', 26017664: u'Antimicrobial stewardship teams have been shown to increase appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy and reduce medical errors and costs in targeted populations, but the effect in non-targeted populations is still unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of inappropriate antibiotic use in a large university hospital and identify areas in which antimicrobial stewardship will be the most effective. In a point prevalence survey we assessed the appropriateness of antibiotic therapy using an electronic surveillance system in combination with a standardized method for duration of therapy, dosage, dosage interval, route of administration, and choice of antibiotic drug. Patients using at least one antibiotic drug were included. Among 996 patients admitted in the surveyed wards, 337 patients (33.8\\xa0%) used one or more antibiotic drugs. Two hundred and twenty-one patients (22.2\\xa0%) used antibiotic medication therapeutically, with a total of 307 antibiotic prescriptions. Antibiotic therapy was deemed inappropriate in 90 (29.3\\xa0%) of these prescribed antibiotics, with an unjustified prescription as the most common reason for an inappropriate prescription. Use of fluoroquinolones and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and a presumed diagnosis of fever of unknown origin, urinary tract infection, and respiratory tract infection were associated with inappropriate antibiotic therapy. Our study provides insight into the (in)appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions in a tertiary care center in the Netherlands and identifies areas for improvement. The use of an electronic surveillance system for this point prevalence study is easy and may serve as a baseline measurement for the future effect of antibiotic stewardship.', 10292484: 'Should laissez faire prevail as to the private-market supply of the AIDS antibody test?

Ceftriaxone was found to be the most frequently prescribed antibiotic as an empirical therapy. 102 (77.86%) patients received Ceftriaxone, followed by ampicillin. The antibiotics were probably used on the basis of clinical condition rather than the result of blood culture, as yield of blood culture was quite low. Conclusion. Our study showed an unjustified use of antibiotics regardless of the admission and discharge diagnosis in acute febrile illnesses.

To produce a model of acute infection, the animals were infected by tularemia (2 x LD50) using Gaiskiy-15 strain of the infectious agent. A viral disease was produced by infecting mice by the equine encephalomyelitis (EEM) virus. The animals were infected 24 h after irradiation. The survival of animals was used as an end point.

There remain many unresolved correspondence problems that arise from attempts to associate functional areas with specific neuroanatomy and to compare both function and anatomy across patient groups. Problems can result from ignorance of the underlying neurology which is then compounded by unjustified inferences drawn from the results of NRR. Usually the magnitude, distribution, and significance of errors in NRR are unknown so the errors in correspondences determined by NRR are also unknown and their effect on experimental results cannot easily be quantified. In this paper we review the principles by which the presumed correspondence and homology of structures is used to drive registration and identify the conceptual and algorithmic areas where current techniques are lacking. We suggest that for applications using NRR to be robust and achieve their potential, context-specific definitions of correspondence must be developed which properly characterise error. Prior knowledge of image content must be utilised to monitor and guide registration and gauge the degree of success. The use of NRR in voxel-based morphometry is examined from this context and found wanting. We conclude that a move away from increasingly sophisticated but context-free registration technology is required and that the veracity of studies that rely on NRR should be keenly questioned when the error distribution is unknown and the results are unsupported by other contextual information.', 11193627: 'The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) has existed and dealt with trade issues since 1947. However, to take on the question of to what extent can we set fair and science-based rules allowing countries to have the sovereign right to set measures for protecting public, animal and plant health and food safety, while not creating unjustified barriers to trade was the challenge of the Uruguay Round negotiators. The outcome of this seven-year exercise was the SPS Agreement discussed here. A number of key issues are addressed: transparency including notification, special and differential treatment for developing countries, harmonization, equivalence, regionalization, risk analysis, and other matters. Early warning and exposure of these issues has encouraged countries to resolve their problems quickly. Some of the issues that should be taken into consideration during this next round are the following: biotechnology, aquaculture, consumer concerns, animal welfare, the environment, organic foods, morality in trade, compliance with the WTO, compensation, and the precautionary principle. Compliance with the decision of the WTO is an area of grave concern, especially if developed and powerful countries continue to threaten the survival of the WTO system through lengthy and costly legal interpretations and appeals of dispute settlements without serious efforts by all parties to find win-win solutions. In spite of these problems, over all we must recognize the significant gains in trade thanks to the SPS Agreement.

The side effects were extremely rare. The antimicrobial activity of ofloxacin after its clinical use for 5 years did not practically change. The drug clinical and bacteriological efficacy in different groups of the patients ranged within 85-91 and 74-80 per cent respectively depending on the process severity. The failure of the therapy was as a rule associated with an insufficient surgical treatment of the purulent foci. It was more frequent in the patients with arteriosclerotic and diabetic gangrene of the lower extremities when due to various reasons the initial surgical operations were not radical. The short treatment courses (for not more than 5-7 days) or an early use of the drug tablets instead of the intravenous injections resulted from an insufficient experience with ofloxacin during the first years of its use. Such an unjustified tactics did not provide stable elimination of the pathogen.

Admitting the intention to have intercourse, together with a perceived association between condom use and disease prevention, were the main concerns. There was some indication of gender differences in these findings. Furthermore, this negative reaction is perceived to be exacerbated according to the partner's reputation, the potential for harming one's own reputation and whether there is a desire for a longer-term relationship with this partner. The most important outcome of the interviews was that these concerns about a partner's negative reaction were largely unjustified, with the vast majority of participants showing only positive responses to scenarios of future partners initiating discussions with them about contraception.

They involve names based on biological properties, sequence differences and geographical, country or place-association designations, or any combination of these. This type of nomenclature is becoming increasingly unsustainable as numbers of sequences of the same virus from new host species and different parts of the world increase. Moreover, this increase is accelerating as world trade and agriculture expand, and climate change progresses. Serious consequences for virus research and disease management might arise from incorrect assumptions made when current within-species phylogenetic group names incorrectly identify properties of group members. This could result in development of molecular tools that incorrectly target dangerous virus strains, potentially leading to unjustified impediments to international trade or failure to prevent such strains being introduced to countries, regions or continents formerly free of them. Dangerous strains might be missed or misdiagnosed by diagnostic laboratories and monitoring programs, and new cultivars with incorrect strain-specific resistances released. Incorrect deductions are possible during phylogenetic analysis of plant virus sequences and errors from strain misidentification during molecular and biological virus research activities. A nomenclature system for within-species plant virus phylogenetic group names is needed which avoids such problems.

Samples of European origin were typically described with greater specificity than samples of other origin. However, findings from European samples were nearly always compared to samples described as \"Caucasian\" and sometimes generalized to all Caucasians or to all humans. These findings suggest that care with population description, while important, may not fully address analytical concerns regarding the interpretation of variable study outcomes or ethical concerns regarding the attribution of genetic observations to broad social groups. Instead, criteria which help investigators better distinguish justified and unjustified forms of population generalization may be required.', 27757962: StringElement('Australian law allows for altruistic surrogacy but prohibits compensation of surrogates beyond their expenses, or the use of professional surrogacy agencies.

Patients were prospectively identified between April and October 2010 with a pharmacy order for intravenous hydralazine. Demographic and clinical information, including pretreatment blood pressure (BP), change in BP and heart rate within 2 hours after administration of hydralazine, and adverse events were obtained. Ninety-four patients (mean age, 69 \\xb1 18 years, 48% women, 89% with known hypertension) received 201 intravenous hydralazine doses (mean dose of 11.4 \\xb1 4.3 mg). Only 4 (2%) patients had evidence of an urgent hypertensive condition. Following hydralazine, BP was reduced by 24/9 \\xb1 29/15 mmHg and heart rate increased by 4 \\xb1 13 beats per minute. Changes from baseline in BP were related to baseline BP. Seventeen patients experienced an adverse event, the most common being hypotension (n = 11). Intravenous hydralazine is commonly prescribed for non-urgent cases of hypertension in the hospitalized patient. While changes in systolic BP are related to baseline BP values, they are highly variable, and associated with hypotension. Thus, this agent may not be useful for treating hypertension in many hospitalized patients and may cause harm if used inappropriately.', 11400594: \"Reproductive cloning in adults/children evokes unfavourable reactions. Direct objections are that cloning is unnatural, that it affects human dignity and violates the individual's right to genetic uniqueness. Consequential objections concern unjustified health risks for the progeny, unjustified psychosocial risks for the clone child and the risk of cloning for eugenetic purposes. There is consensus that reproductive cloning of existing persons is unjustify as yet because of the health risks for the offspring. Reproductive cloning of embryos is possible by means of nucleus transplantation and of embryo splitting. The ethical analysis of reproductive cloning of embryos depends on the purposes and applications. At least some of the moral objections against cloning of adults/children are not or not completely applicable to reproductive cloning of embryos. Conditions to be put to reproductive cloning of embryos are efficacy, safety and, at least for the time being, avoidance of asynchrony in transferring identical embryos. The ethical aspects of its application in the context of genetical reproductive techniques must be evaluated separately.

Consequently, there is a need to continuously monitor and to improve the safety assessment of marketed drugs. Nonetheless, pharmacovigilance practice frequently lacks causality assessment. Here, we report the case of flupirtine, a centrally acting non-opioid analgesic. We re-evaluated the plausibility and causality of 226 unselected, spontaneously reported hepatobiliary adverse drug reactions according to the adapted Bradford-Hill criteria, CIOMS score and WHO-UMC scales. Thorough re-evaluation showed that only about 20% of the reported cases were probable or likely for flupirtine treatment, suggesting an incidence of flupirtine-related liver injury of 1\\u2236100,000 when estimated prescription data are considered, or 0.8 in 10,000 on the basis of all 226 reported adverse drug reactions. Neither daily or cumulative dose nor duration of treatment correlated with markers of liver injury. In the majority of cases (151/226), an average of 3 co-medications with drugs known for their liver liability was observed that may well be causative for adverse drug reactions, but were reported under a suspected flupirtine ADR. Our study highlights the need to improve the quality and standards of ADR reporting. This should be done with utmost care taking into account contributing factors such as concomitant medications including over-the-counter drugs, the medical history and current health conditions, in order to avoid unjustified flagging and drug warnings that may erroneously cause uncertainty among healthcare professionals and patients, and may eventually lead to unjustified safety signals of useful drugs with a reasonable risk to benefit ratio.', 19682544: 'Preliminary data suggest that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the brain may produce a modest slowing of disease progression in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that rTMS given as continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), repeated monthly for one year, would affect ALS progression. We performed a double blind, placebo-controlled trial. Twenty patients with ALS were randomly allocated to blinded real or placebo stimulation. cTBS of the motor cortex was performed for five consecutive days every month for one year. Primary outcome was the rate of decline as evaluated with the revised ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R). Treatment was well tolerated. There was no significant difference in the ALSFRS-R score deterioration between patients treated with real or placebo stimulation. ALSFRS-R mean scores declined from 32.0 (SD 7.1) at study entry to 23.1 (SD 6.3) at 12 months in patients receiving real cTBS and from 31.3 (SD 6.9) to 21.2 (SD 6.0) in those receiving placebo stimulation.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the results of routine bronchoscopy performed in patients with peripheral lung nodule of 5-40 mm in diameter. From 60 patients with peripheral lung nodule, who underwent routine diagnostic fiberoptic bronchoscopy between 2003 - 2005, we selected 36 patients in whom the final discrimination between malignant and benign tumor was achieved based on either pathological examination or radiological criteria (lack of growth within 2 years of radiological follow up). There were 22 (61%) patients with malignant tumor and 14 (39%) with benign nodule. All malignant tumors were lung carcinomas. In 10 of these patients we found macroscopic abnormalities during bronchoscopy and in 9 of them pathologic examination of specimens collected during the procedure could confirm malignant tissue. In two patients with benign lung nodule a second lung lesion (in different lung lobe) which proved to be lung cancer was identified during fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of fiberoptic bronchoscopy in the diagnosis of peripheral lung nodules were 41%, 100%, and 64% respectively. Abandoning fiberoptic bronchoscopy in the diagnostic algorithm in patients with peripheral lung nodules seems unjustified, although its limitations should be taken into account.', 20819373: 'Concerns about foodborne salmonellosis have led many countries to introduce microbiological criteria for certain food products. If such criteria are not well-grounded in science, they could be an unjustified obstacle to trade. Raw poultry products are an important part of the global food market. Import and export ambiguities and regulatory confusion resulting from different Salmonella requirements were the impetus for convening an international group of scientific experts from 16 countries to discuss the scientific and technical issues that affect the setting of a microbiological criterion for Salmonella contamination of raw chicken. A particular concern for the group was the use of criteria implying a zero tolerance for Salmonella and suggesting complete absence of the pathogen. The notion can be interpreted differently by various stakeholders and was considered inappropriate because there is neither an effective means of eliminating Salmonella from raw poultry nor any practical method for verifying its absence. Therefore, it may be more useful at present to set food safety metrics that involve reductions in hazard levels. Such terms as \"zero tolerance\" or \"absence of a microbe\" in relation to raw poultry should be avoided unless defined and explained by international agreement. Risk assessment provides a more meaningful approach than a zero tolerance philosophy, and new metrics, such as performance objectives that are linked to human health outcomes, should be utilized throughout the food chain to help define risk and identify ways to reduce adverse effects on public health.', 15734191: 'Causal inference of exposure-response relations from data is a challenging aspect of risk assessment with important implications for public and private risk management. Such inference, which is fundamentally empirical and based on exposure (or dose)-response models, seldom arises from a single set of data; rather, it requires integrating heterogeneous information from diverse sources and disciplines including epidemiology, toxicology, and cell and molecular biology. The causal aspects we discuss focus on these three aspects: drawing sound inferences about causal relations from one or more observational studies; addressing and resolving biases that can affect a single multivariate empirical exposure-response study; and applying the results from these considerations to the microbiological risk management of human health risks and benefits of a ban on antibiotic use in animals, in the context of banning enrofloxacin or macrolides, antibiotics used against bacterial illnesses in poultry, and the effects of such bans on changing the risk of human food-borne campylobacteriosis infections. The purposes of this paper are to describe novel causal methods for assessing empirical causation and inference; exemplify how to deal with biases that routinely arise in multivariate exposure- or dose-response modeling; and provide a simplified discussion of a case study of causal inference using microbial risk analysis as an example. The case study supports the conclusion that the human health benefits from a ban are unlikely to be greater than the excess human health risks that it could create, even when accounting for uncertainty. We conclude that quantitative causal analysis of risks is a preferable to qualitative assessments because it does not involve unjustified loss of information and is sound under the inferential use of risk results by management.', 16876979: 'As yet, in vitro assessment of the immunotoxic potency of respiratory agents is not possible. The complexity of the endpoint and the respiratory tract, and the limited availability of well-documented respiratory agents are the main reasons. The evidence that epithelial cells (ECs) are triggered by compounds to express in vitro surface proteins and soluble mediators, has stimulated their use for developing tests for respiratory immunotoxicity. A variety of airway ECs and EC-lines have been assessed, but the available information seems to point at human alveolar cells (e.g., A549) as the most convenient cell type. EC-based test formats with various degrees of complexity have been assessed. Sofar, promising results were obtained using a 3D model using the human A549 lung cell line. Dendritic cells (DCs) have been subjected to intensive research. However, currently available tests are not well suited to discern among the potency of sensitizers. Potential explanations include the lack of standardised protocols for the generation of DCs, no good standards for estimating the quality of in vitro derived DC-cultures, and limited dynamics of the currently used end-points. Alveolar macrophages (AMs) have so far received less attention. This may proof unjustified as macrophages may link innate responses to adaptive immunity. The observation that ECs, DCs and AMs affect each other, suggests that test formats are required combining at least two of these cell types if ranking of compounds according to their sensitising potency is the aim. In addition, the capacity of compounds to cross a cellular membrane is an important property of an immunotoxic compound, which can be assessed only in 3D reconstituted human tissue models. While promising data have been reported for the skin, immunocompetent 3D reconstituted human lung remains to be evaluated for respiratory immunotoxicity. Obviously, the success of any of these simplified test (as compared to the complexity of the immune response) is highly dependent on the availability of early stage biomarkers (expressed at mucosal barrier level) that are predictive for relevant immunotoxicity mechanisms occurring down-stream of the immune response. As yet, such biomarkers are not yet available.', 23627189: StringElement('The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate drug interactions and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in the older patients admitted to the emergency department (ED) and to characterize risk factors.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'OBJECTIVE', u'Label': u'PURPOSE'}), 28509626: \"Wide rejection of conventional hormone therapy (HT) after the initial publication of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) led to unjustified use of custom-compounded bioidentical hormones. In the USA, it became an unregulated drug manufacturer industry in disguise, without proper control and making false claims and misleading advertisements. Manufacturing quality is not ensured. Unspecific harm from compounding has occurred on a large scale, such as deaths from infected products and end-stage renal failure plus carcinoma due to confusion between different Chinese herbs. Oral estrogens increase venous thromboembolic and ischemic stroke events, even more when overdosed; these excess risks can be avoided by non-oral administration, readily accessible in custom-compounded HT by administering estradiol through diverse routes (of which transdermal is the best documented). Another risk specific to custom-compounded HT, resulting from estrogen/progestogen imbalance, might be excess endometrial carcinomas. HT can be optimized by continuously combining transdermal estradiol with progesterone (when required). Registered preparations do exist for such a more physiological treatment and therefore must be preferred. Custom compounding is only seldom legitimate, for example in case of allergy (such as to peanut oil) or to prescribe different combinations, doses or components (e.g. estriol, dehydroepiandrosterone or testosterone), even when not approved by local regulatory authorities despite being scientifically acceptable.\", 29445569: 'The recent hype surrounding the antimelanogenic properties of glutathione has resulted in physicians frequently administering it as a \"wonder\" drug for skin lightening and treatment of hyperpigmentation, especially in ethnic populations with darker skin tones. This phenomenon has seen a recent surge owing to aggressive marketing and capitalization of pharma-cosmeceutical companies. However, the unbridled and prodigal use of it, especially as a parenteral formulation, seems unjustified, given the lacunae in our knowledge about its antimelanogenic potential, limited clinical evidence favoring its role in skin lightening, and the statutory ban/advisory issued by certain federal agencies. Even though parenteral glutathione is approved only for severe liver disorders and for prevention of chemotherapy associated neurotoxicity, the lack of statutory laws governing the use of systemic glutathione in most countries has contributed to its unchecked use for skin lightening. The current clinical evidence of intravenous glutathione for skin lightening is limited to a single study with a dubious study design and apparently flawed analysis of results, casting doubt on the drug\\'s efficacy and reported adverse effects. Two studies evaluating oral/sublingual administration and one trial involving the use of topical glutathione reported good safety profile and appreciable but reversible results on skin tone.

(b) A well-designed, placebo-controlled, study of gold (Empire Rheumatism Council, 1960, 1961) provides strong evidence that the drug has a beneficial effect lasting about 18 months. It does not establish any advantage beyond that period. Two reports which claim to show a favourable influence of gold on radiological progression are suspect because of faults in trial design. (c) There has been only one placebo-controlled study of penicillamine (Multicentre Trial Group, 1973). This also provides evidence of medium-term efficacy. No information is available about x-ray progression. (d) Studies of other drugs for which 'disease-modifying' activity has been claimed (antimalarials, antiproliferative agents, corticosteroids, etc.) have similarly provided evidence only of medium-term efficacy. With information now available it is possible to identify some of the reasons why these trials have failed to answer the fundamentally important question of whether the drugs can modify the long-term course of RA. (a) Trial designs have concentrated on following process measures (e.g., ESR) rather than outcome measures (e.g., disability and deformity). Observers have thus come to accept the former as being important in themselves, to the neglect of the latter. (b) Psychological pressures to provide relief for patients, combined with unjustified assumptions about the long-term efficacy of these drugs, have produced a climate of expectations amongst both clinicians and patients which makes it difficult to sustain long-term trials against placebo. (c) Traditional radiological assessment methods have proved insensitive. (d) Recent advances in clinical trial design and analysis (developed largely in specialties outside rheumatology) were not available at the time of most of these trials. At this stage clinical trials of 'disease-modifying' drugs should seek to answer the following questions: (a) Is it worth giving drugs such as gold and penicillamine for periods longer than 6 months? (b) How long does the effect of such treatment last? (c) Is any information obtainable before or during treatment which predicts favourable or unfavourable responses?

All 27 patients attained the minimal effective dose, ranging from 0.5 to 2 mg daily, which controlled the frequency and intensity of symptoms with minimal side effects. At daily maintenance doses of 2, 1, and 0.5 mg the frequencies of attacks per weeks of therapy were 1/14.6, 1/7.2, and 1/8.2 wk, respectively. Side effects with maintenance therapy included menstrual abnormalities and virilization in four females and elevation of serum creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) in five males. In six patients on maintenance doses of stanozolol, serum levels of testosterone, free thyroxin (T4), and thyroxin binding globulin (TBG) (four males), and of estradiol, progesterone, T4, and TBG (two females) were normal. Slightly low serum levels of progesterone and TBG were found in two females who had normal menstrual cycles. Statistically significant elevations above pretherapy levels of serum inhibitor to the activated first component of complement function and C4 protein and function occurred when patients were on maintenance therapy, but these measurements remained below the lower limit of normal range.

The last problem - i.e., the damage of the device from a power injection - is not an unjustified fear, but a reality. A warning by the US Food and Drug Administration of July 2004 reports around 250 complications of this kind, referring to both port and central venous catheters and peripherally inserted central catheter systems, which occurred over a period of several years; in all cases, the damage occurred during the injection of contrast material by means of power injectors for computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging procedures. Though the risk associated with the use of ports in radiodiagnostics is thus clear, it has been suggested that administration of the contrast material via the port may have some advantage in terms of image quality, increased comfort for the patient, and maybe more accurate reproducibility of the patient's own follow-up exams. This contention needs to be supported by evidence. Also, since many cancer patients who need frequent computed tomography studies already have totally implantable systems, it would seem reasonable to try to define how and when such systems may safely be used. The purpose of this consensus statement is to define recommendations based on the best available evidence, for the safe use of implantable ports in radiodiagnostics.\", 26099226: StringElement('In kidney transplantation, the use of Anti-Thymocyte Globulins (ATG) as induction therapy has been described as a possible treatment for reducing the prevalence of Delayed Graft Function (DGF).

The availability of an emesis basin for every patient in the postanesthesia recovery unit is a reflection of the limited success with the available therapeutic techniques.257 There had been little change in the incidence of postoperative emesis since the introduction of halothane into clinical practice in 1956. However, newer anesthetic drugs (e.g. propofol) appear to have contributed to a recent decline in the incidence of emesis. Factors associated with an increased risk of postoperative emesis include age, gender (menses), obesity, previous history of motion sickness or postoperative vomiting, anxiety, gastroparesis, and type and duration of the surgical procedure (e.g., laparoscopy, strabismus, middle ear procedures). Anesthesiologists have little, if any, control over these surgical factors. However, they do have control over many other factors that influence postoperative emesis (e.g., preanesthetic medication, anesthetic drugs and techniques, and postoperative pain management). Although routine antiemetic prophylaxis is clearly unjustified, patients at high risk for postoperative emesis should receive special considerations with respect to the prophylactic use of antiemetic drugs. Minimally effective doses of antiemetic drugs can be administered to reduce the incidence of sedation and other deleterious side effects. Potent nonopioid analgesics (e.g., ketorolac) can be used to control pain while avoiding some of the opioid-related side effects. Gentle handling in the immediate postoperative period is also essential. If emesis does occur, aggressive intravenous hydration and pain management are important components of the therapeutic regimen, along with antiemetic drugs. If one antiemetic does not appear to be effective, another drug with a different site of action should be considered. With the availability of new antiserotonin drugs, the incidence of recurrent (intractable) emesis could be further decreased. Research into the mechanisms of this common postoperative complication may help in improving the management of emetic sequelae in the future. As suggested in a recent editorial, improvement in antiemetic therapy could have a major impact for surgical patients, particularly after ambulatory surgery.

After correcting for the global growth in publications, the amount of papers performing a generic SA has notably increased over the last decade. Even if OAT is still the most largely used technique in SA, there is a clear increase in the use of GSA with preference respectively for regression and variance-based techniques. Even after adjusting for the growth of publications in the sole modelling field, to which SA and GSA normally apply, the trend is confirmed. Data about regions of origin and discipline are also briefly discussed.

In our country there are an estimated 40 million amalgam fillings in place. The mercury present in these fillings has caused health concerns over the last 160 years that amalgam has been used in decayed teeth. The fears have always proven to be unjustified and no harmful effects have ever been demonstrated in dental patients. Mercury can be found in several forms. In dentistry, only the metallic form is used, while inorganic and organic compounds are also present in the environment. The metallic form is absorbed in the human body mostly through the lungs. Once mercury reaches toxic levels inside the body, it will interfere with cell metabolism. Most important among the target organs are the brain, the liver and the kidneys. Elimination occur through urine and feces. Mercury is universally found in blood and urine. The concentration depends on absorption by air, water, nutrition, medication (including dental fillings) and occupational hazards. There are four kinds of objectives to dental amalgam: oral galvanism, toxicity, allergenicity and ecological grievances. Disorders from oral galvanism are difficult and delicate to evaluate as the actual currents are very small. Furthermore, no significant difference can be found in current intensity between patients with and without complaints. Finally patients with complaints often present other oral disorders, the treatment of which most often eliminates all complaints that could be attributed to oral galvanism. Toxicity is dose dependent. Industrial safety rules indicate that the amount of mercury absorbed from dental amalgam fillings is far below the safety level. HgB and HgU levels in patients with amalgam fillings are situated well below the acceptable levels. Allergic disorders are observed in patients with amalgam fillings but far less than expected in view of the wide spread use of dental amalgam. The problem of mercury spilling from dental amalgam fillings into the environment will be resolved by strict legislation in the near future. In this context, it can be stated that the use of dental amalgam is safe and justified. Furthermore, it is also advisable as no other material can meet the actual dental needs as efficiently as can dental amalgam.', 19056190: StringElement('Most antibiotic therapies are initiated in the emergency unit (EU).

The results showed that mucoregulators are frequently prescribed by GPs for children and adults with AB, or in AECB. This high prescribing rate is due to the belief of the GPs that these drugs are effective and well tolerated, which is confirmed by the literature.

Often, the prescription of these drugs with little toxicity is unjustified because of insecurity about the diagnosis of the clinician; 'drugs of fear' [4]. In our surveys, some 15% of the antibiotic prescriptions in surgical and internal medicine wards were considered unjustified [5,6].

In this paper, aspects of the quality of antimicrobial prescribing in the hospital setting will be discussed.\", 26941087: 'There are unique challenges in the treatment and prevention of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) with antithrombotics in elderly patients: elderly patients usually require multiple drugs due to comorbidities, are highly susceptible to adverse drug reactions and drug-drug interactions, may have cognitive problems affecting compliance and complications, are especially exposed to the risk of falls and, most importantly, ageing is an independent risk factor for bleeding. Antithrombotic drugs, alone or in association, further and variously amplify age-related bleeding risk. Moreover, age-related changes in primary haemostasis may potentially affect the pharmacodynamics of some antiplatelet drugs. Thus, elderly subjects might be more or less sensitive to standard antiplatelet regimens depending on individual characteristics affecting antiplatelet drug response. Importantly, elderly patients are a rapidly growing population worldwide, have the highest incidence of ACS, but are poorly represented in clinical trials. As a consequence, evidence on antithrombotic drug benefits and risks is limited. Thus, in the real-world setting, older people are often denied antithrombotic drugs because of unjustified concerns, or might be over-treated and exposed to excessive bleeding risk. Personalized antithrombotic therapy in elderly patients is particularly critical, to minimize risks without affecting efficacy.', 23662241: 'Allografting patients with human leukocyte antigens (HLA) which are recognized by preformed antibodies constitutes the main cause for hyper-acute or acute rejections. In order to select recipients without these donor-specific antibodies, the complement-dependent cytotoxicity crossmatch (CDC-CM) assay was developed as a standard procedure about forty years ago. The negative outcome of pretransplant crossmatching represents the most important requirement for a successful kidney graft survival. The artificially positive outcomes of CDC-based crossmatches due to the underlying disease Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), however, may lead to the unjustified refusal of adequate kidney grafts. Two prospective female recipients destined for a living as well as for a cadaver kidney donation, respectively, exhibited positive CDC-based crossmatch outcomes although for both patients no historical immunizing events were known. Furthermore, solid phase-based screening or antibody differentiation analyses never led to positive results. Immediate reruns of the CDC-based crossmatch assays using the alternative antibody monitoring system (AMS-)crossmatch ELISA resulted in unequivocally negative outcomes. Consequently both transplantations were performed without any immunological complications for the hitherto follow-up time of 25 and 28 months, respectively. We here show two case reports demonstrating an alternative methodical approach to circumvent CDC-based artefacts and point to the urgent need to substitute the CDC-based crossmatch procedure at least for special groups of patients.', 6391458: 'Pain which may otherwise be considered as unnecessary and unreasonable may apparently be justified by the purpose for which the act causing the pain was carried out. When deciding whether or not cruelty has occurred, the court may consider, inter alia: the element of sport associated with the incident; measures taken to alleviate the pain and suffering; whether the infliction of the pain was justified and lawfully excused in that it was inflicted in the protection of personal property or of other animals or persons, who were actually being attacked or under real threat of imminent attack when the act causing the pain took place. In order to be lawfully excused on these grounds, the measures taken to protect personal safety and property must be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the actual or threatened attack; local custom and belief; the care, skill and competence with which the act was performed; an honest belief held by the doer of the act that the act would lead to benefits to the animal, to the owner of the animal or to society generally. These criteria indicate that cruelty occurs when pain has been caused by an omission to remedy or alleviate the effects of a positive act, by the doing of the act, where the act or omission has been done intentionally or as the result of negligence, or where the pain is unnecessary and unjustified and the doer of the act knows that the act is unnecessary and unjustifiable.', 3118758: 'The possibility of re-using mitomycin C (MMC) containing solutions after intravesical instillation in the urinary bladder is evaluated in view of the chemical stability of the drug. Generalized positive conclusions about the re-use of these solutions are unjustified due to the possible variation in the urinary pH of individual patients. Only in cases where the urinary pH during treatment is greater than 6 may re-use be considered, provided that bacterial contamination can be avoided. In cases where the pH is too low (i.e. less than 6) a considerable degradation occurs during instillation (about 34% at pH 5) and storage during 1 week at 4 degrees C (about 25% at pH 5). On the other hand, considering the acid activation pathway, induction of a low urinary pH during treatment might enhance the efficiency, although re-use in this case is impossible.', 12611240: UnicodeElement(u'Multiauthorship and unjustified authorship have been documented in journals with wide international circulation but this has not been thoroughly studied in journals from developing countries.

Associative theorists have devoted much energy to establishing what representations are involved in any given learning paradigm and the rules that determine the degree to which the link is strengthened. They have paid less attention to the question of what determines that a representation will be activated, assuming, for the case of classical conditioning, that presentation of an appropriately intense stimulus from an appropriate modality will be enough. But this assumption is unjustified. I present the results of experiments on the effects of stimulus exposure in rats that suggest that mere exposure to a stimulus can influence its perceptual effectiveness -- that the ability of a stimulus to activate its representation can be changed by experience. This conclusion is of interest for two reasons. First, it supplies a direct explanation for the phenomenon of perceptual learning -- the enhancement of stimulus discriminability produced by some forms of stimulus exposure. Second, it poses a theoretical challenge in that it seems to require the existence of a learning mechanism outside the scope of those envisaged by current formal theories of associative learning. I offer some speculations as to how this mechanism might be incorporated into such theories.', 20528072: \"One measure commonly used to assess posttraumatic stress disorder is the PTSD Checklist (PCL). Lang and Stein (2005) extracted 4 subsets of PCL items, validating 2 of them for possible use in screening in primary care settings. The viability of the 4 item subsets was evaluated psychometrically in the present study with a sample of Hurricane Katrina survivors (N = 337). Corrected item-total and corrected item-cluster correlations were calculated and compared with those obtained by Lang and Stein. In addition, the sensitivity, specificity, and overall correct classification of the 4 item subsets were evaluated. With methodology approximating Lang and Stein's work, the current data would lead to the development of different screening versions of the PCL. Although some psychometric support was achieved (e.g., high sensitivity), use of the Lang and Stein PCL item subsets for screening natural disaster survivors appears unjustified on the basis of the present data.\", 10860211: '\"Run-in\" and \"washout\" periods involving the withholding of medication are widely used in drug research trials in pursuit of both patient safety and scientific reliability. Such no-medication periods can be justified ethically provided that they are apparent to patients, who can thereby properly consent to undergoing them. Less widespread, but still common, is the practice of \"single blinding\" no-medication periods, concealing them from patients by means of placebo. Whilst all placebos involve a measure of concealment, their use is typically justified in drug research trials (i) by their preserving the uncertainty generated by the random allocation of different treatments within a drug trial; and (ii) by the researchers openly declaring both the randomisation process and the chances of receiving placebo. In the single blind placebo \"run-in\" or \"washout\", neither of these conditions is met. This paper considers three possible defences of the practice of using single blind placebo \"run-ins\" or \"washouts\" and finds them all to fail; the practice appears ethically unjustified.', 15363764: 'Opioids have an unjustified reputation for causing mania in cats, but with refinements in dosing they are now used successfully in this species. The mu-opioid agonists are generally considered the best analgesics. Morphine (0.1-0.3 mg/kg) is effective in a clinical setting. Methadone (up to 0.5 mg/kg) has a similar profile to morphine. Pethidine (Demerol, meperidine; 2-5 mg/kg) is a useful analgesic with a faster onset but shorter duration of action than morphine. Oxymorphone and hydromorphone (0.05-0.1 mg/kg) are widely used in the USA. These opioids are more potent (up to 10 times), and longer acting than morphine in cats. Butorphanol (0.1-0.4 mg/kg) is a mu-opioid antagonist that produces its analgesic actions through kappa agonist activity. It rapidly reaches a ceiling effect, is short acting and is a weaker analgesic than pure mu opioids. Buprenorphine (0.01-0.02 mg/kg), a partial mu-agonist, is the most popular opioid used in small animal practice in the UK, other parts of Europe, Australia and South Africa. In clinical studies it has produced better analgesia than several other opioids and appears to be highly suitable for perioperative pain management in cats. NSAIDs are also used in cats for pain management, although cats metabolise these differently from other species. With appropriate dosing, carprofen (1-4 mg/kg) and meloxicam (0.3 mg/kg) have proved highly effective with few side effects. The use of ketoprofen (2 mg/kg), tolfenamic acid (4 mg/kg) and vedaprofen (0.5 mg/kg) has been reported in cats. Other less traditional analgesics such as ketamine, medetomidine and local anaesthetics are also used for clinical pain management.

With the discovery of nuclear receptors for retinoic acid additional functions are likely to be found. The recommended dietary allowances (RDA) for vitamin A, including provitamin A carotenoids, vary greatly between countries. This may be explained by difficulties in establishing needs: Homeostatic mechanisms tightly control absorption, storage, release and transport of vitamin A to target tissue, and plasma concentrations do not reflect status unless there is vitamin A deficiency or excess. In the United States RDAs were established on the basis of vitamin A depletion-repletion studies with radio-labelled retinol. Intake requirements were calculated to amount to 1,000 micrograms retinol equivalents (RE) for men, 800 micrograms RE for non-pregnant as well as pregnant women and 1,300 micrograms RE for lactating women. Dietary intake studies in different countries have shown that it is in principle possible to obtain these values from the diet either as preformed vitamin A or in the form of provitamin A carotenoids or both. Risk groups for inadequate intakes include low-income groups and younger persons following weight-reducing and other unbalanced diets. Since experience with recommended intake values in the United States has been excellent, attempts at reducing these levels are unjustified and should be resisted. At intakes of up to three RDA values (approximately 3,000 micrograms RE) no unwanted side-effects are to be expected. Even higher doses, if not taken chronically, have been well tolerated, e.g. in deprived populations with low liver reserves. The suggestion derived from a case-control study that vitamin A taken at supplemental doses of 2,400 micrograms RE may be teratogenic have not been confirmed by several other studies. But it is judicious to follow the recommendations of the American Pediatric Society that women should not exceed a total daily intake of 3,000 micrograms RE. In developing countries where acute and chronic vitamin A deficiency is endemic causing xerophthalmia and blindness and increasing the prevalence of infectious diseases and death in children, special efforts are being made by WHO/UNICEF to provide programs for the eradication of vitamin A deficiency by immediate treatment and by long-term changes in dietary practices.', 7462601: 'Strains of Treponema hyodysenteriae capable of inducing swine dysentery in specific pathogen-free pigs were compared with other spirochaetes from the porcine alimentary tract by biochemical and serological tests and by electrophoresis of their proteins. Carbohydrate fermentation and esculin hydrolysis were similar in all the spirochaetes. Indole was produced by T. hyodysenteriae and by some of the other spirochaetes. Analysis of the fatty acids produced from glucose showed a difference between T. hyodysenteriae and other spirochaetes only in the amount of n-butyric acid produced. The indirect fluorescent antibody test showed extensive cross-reactions between all the spirochaetes unless antisera were first absorbed. A microtitre agglutination test and a growth-inhibition test were both more specific; strains of T. hyodysenteriae could be distinguished from the other spirochaetes using unabsorbed sera. Both tests revealed some antigenic heterogeneity among strains of T, hyodysenteriae. The cell proteins of a single strain of T. hyodysenteriae gave an electrophoretic pattern distinct from those of the other spirochaetes. Two of the six spirochaetes not associated with swine dysentery, PWS/B and PWS/C, were indistinguishable serologically and electrophoretically. The other four strains were serologically distinct from one another and from PWS/B and PWS/C. Only two of these spirochaetes were examined electrophoretically, but each gave a different pattern from PWS/B and PWS/C. The diversity observed among spirochaetes not associated with swine dysentery indicates that their suggested inclusion in a single species, T. innocens, may prove to be unjustified.', 9459403: 'Recent data suggests that culture isolations and susceptibility profiles are overlooked, misinterpreted and are not a major determinant in the process of selecting anti-bacterial therapy. Compliance with empiric antibiotic protocols, relationship between blood culture results, change and selection of secondary antibiotic regimens and effect on outcome and length of hospitalization were assessed prospectively in 134 episodes of community-acquired bacteraemia due to urinary tract infection in adults. Empiric antibiotic protocols were correct in 112 episodes (83.6%), excessive in 12 episodes (8.95%) and inappropriate in 10 (7.5%) episodes, with no significant difference in outcome or length of hospitalization. Excluding early deaths, the adequacy of the initial antibiotic therapy was clearly associated with mortality (four deaths out of eight episodes treated incorrectly vs. 21/117 treated appropriately [P = 0.029]), but not with length of hospitalization. Antibiotic change was theoretically required in 92/119 (77.3%) episodes (27 [29.3] incorrect regimen, 65 [70.65%] excessive regimen), but actual change was made in only 43 episodes, of which three protocols were changed from a correct to an incorrect regimen, and one patient continued to receive an incorrect regimen. Eighteen out of 34 changes in excessive protocols were still excessive. Adequacy of secondary antibiotic treatment was clearly associated with outcome (5/10 vs. 4/109 [P<0.001]). Excessive protocols were not associated with better outcome or shorter hospital stay. Change of antibiotic regimen was associated with the presence of background diseases (5.6-fold increase) and inversely with hospitalization on the urology ward (0.254), but no independent factors associated with correct or incorrect secondary regimens could be identified. Although the compliance rate with empiric protocols was satisfactory, in many bacteraemic episodes blood culture results and antibiotic sensitivity profiles are overlooked, leading to higher mortality and excessive, unjustified use of expensive and broad-spectrum antibiotics. We could not identify factors associated with this disregard of susceptibility profiles.', 7218892: 'In a prospective study we compared the ability of two quality assessment methods--the standard criteria list and the criteria map--to predict the appropriateness of the disposition decision for 421 patients with chest pain who presented to two emergency departments. To evaluate the quality of this decision, each patient was followed at home or in the hospital to determine whether an acute condition requiring hospital admission was present. Among the 169 discharged patients, the map scores of the eight with admissible disease were significantly higher than the score for those without admissible disease (p = 0.02). For the 252 admitted patients, a similar relationship between map score and the admissible disease outcome was observed (p = 0.0001). There was no significant relationship between list score and outcome among either the admitted or the discharged patients. Multivariate logistic analyses confirmed the importance of the map score as a predictor of admissible disease. The map score was superior to the list score and to demographic variables in its ability to correctly classify patients with and without admissible disease. The demonstrated relationship between map score and patient outcome enables the map to be used in a quality assurance system.

Cancer represents a spectrum of diseases, and posttreatment impairments may vary from none, in the majority of cases, to major functional disability. Employers understandably have difficulty recognizing the variability that exists, both in terms of functional capacity and prognosis, and they are often unaware of the improved prognosis for many cancers. Today, many patients receive adjuvant chemotherapy or prolonged intermittent treatment and need to adjust their work schedule to allow for this. Some people need job training or vocational counseling; in many states, vocational rehabilitation agencies now have an increased interest in providing services to cancer patients. Discrimination against the cancer patient has been demonstrated; the major problems are in the area of hiring practices. Efforts need to be continued to educate employers and the public and to ensure that the rights of the cancer patient are recognized. We may, however, do our patients a disservice if we overemphasize potential problems to a degree that increases patient fear and insecurity in regard to employment. Instead, we as physicians may be able to help prevent problems by more effective communication with employers on behalf of our patients, as well as by direct patient counseling. The insurance problems of cancer patients, particularly those relating to health insurance, do require major attention. The potential productivity, as well as the quality of life, of the cancer patient are jeopardized when he or she feels unable to change jobs because of fear of loss of insurance coverage. The relatively high number of reported cancellations and changes in insurance benefits that have been reported by cancer patients also represents an area of concern, since some of these appear medically unjustified. The physician's opinion and input may be of importance in preventing or solving individual insurance problems. The physician can also help the cancer patient who has employment problems by providing information about available resources. The above-mentioned employment booklet (#4585-PS), available from the ACS, may be useful and contains information about legal resources.

Somewhat surprising was the fact that up to 36% of the interviewed physicians considered that the intrauterine device is either the most frequently used or the most recommended method. Even the quantity of reports on condoms being the most frequently used method was relatively high (8-10%). 6% of the questioned physicians stated NFP methods as being mainly used, and 10% of the physicians recommended these methods.

Calcineurin inhibitors and alkylating agents have been classical treatment strategies for such cases, but specific toxicity limits the use of these drugs. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is an inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase and thus de novo purine synthesis. Several uncontrolled clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of MMF in steroid dependent NS with or without prior use of CyP and in children with nephrotoxicity due to prolonged CyA treatment.

Since the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 enzyme is primarily involved in this metabolism, genetic polymorphisms of this enzyme, but also drug-induced CYP2D6 inhibition can result in considerably reduced endoxifen formation and as a consequence may affect the efficacy of tamoxifen treatment. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) have been effectively used for the treatment of depression and hot flashes, both of which occur frequently in tamoxifen-treated women. Due to the drug-drug interaction considerably reduced endoxifen concentrations by inhibition of CYP2D6 will be the result. Evidence of a significant influence of strong CYP2D6-inhibiting drugs on the pharmacokinetics of tamoxifen has resulted in recommendations to avoid potent CYP2D6-inhibiting antidepressants (e.g., paroxetine, fluoxetine) in patients treated with tamoxifen for breast cancer. Nevertheless, dispensing data for tamoxifen and seven regularly used SSRIs/SNRIs in the period between 2005 and 2010, obtained from a large community pharmacy database in the Netherlands (3,000,000 people), show that the potent CYP2D6-inhibiting drug paroxetine remains one of the most frequently used antidepressants in tamoxifen-treated patients. Moreover, trends in the use of SSRIs/SNRIs in the population of all women were similar with trends in women using tamoxifen. Apparently, the recommendations to avoid paroxetine in tamoxifen-treated women have not been implemented into clinical practice. Several reasons may underlie continued use of this drug-drug combination. Contrary to CYP2D6 polymorphisms, drug-induced CYP2D6 inhibition can easily be avoided, since alternative drugs are available. In clinical practice, one should strive to avoid potent CYP2D6 inhibitors as much as possible in tamoxifen-treated patients to reduce the risk of compromising the efficacy of the hormonal therapy.

Preoperative determination of HCC grade by PNB has low concordance with explant pathologic grade and low sensitivity and positive predictive value in identifying poorly differentiated tumors.

Nonetheless, its routine use in all the pretreatment node-positive patients who become cN0 after NAC is unjustified due to the unacceptably high false-negative rate, which can be improved in a subset of patients. Axillary surgery omission in selected patients with a low risk of ALN metastasis has gained more and more research interest because the SLNs are tumor-free in more than 70% of all patients.

This article reviews the progress in SLNB in patients with breast cancer.', 14567201: \"The consensus statement from the American Pain Society and American Academy of Pain Medicine states that the undertreatment of pain is unjustified [6]. It has been suggested that opioid therapy can be used effectively to treat noncancer pain in a subset of patients [26], and this is becoming more acceptable [3]. Providing sustained analgesia is an important aspect of therapy, and medications should be administered on an around-the-clock basis, because regular administration of doses maintains a constant level of drug in the body and helps prevent recurrence of pain. Ideal treatment for persistent pain is a long-acting opioid administered around the clock to prevent baseline pain, with the use of short-acting opioids as supplemental agents for breakthrough pain. Controlled-release formulations can lessen the inconvenience associated with around-the-clock administration of short-acting opioids. Sustained analgesia also can be achieved with transdermal fentanyl, which combines a strong opioid with a 72-hour release profile and the benefits of a parenteral route, avoiding first-pass metabolism. Controlled-release formulations of morphine and oxycodone are available in the United States, and hydromorphone preparations are being reviewed for approval. Clinical experience with these formulations and transdermal fentanyl indicates that these agents are equally effective in controlling pain. Studies have demonstrated improved quality of life with the transdermal route and with controlled-release morphine and oxycodone. Because of patch reapplication every 72 hours, the transdermal route also enhances compliance. Use of an opioid without the need for oral or intravenous administration and the opportunity to improve compliance are among the advantages of the transdermal route in clinical practice. The nurse has an important role in the management of patients receiving long-acting opioids for chronic noncancer pain, Facilitation of the conversion from short-acting to long-acting opioids may be the initial step. Individualization of therapy to determine which route and product best suits the patient's needs and lifestyle can be accomplished through a comprehensive nursing assessment. Titration of dose along with institution of a short-acting opioid for break-through pain may require frequent interventions that a nurse familiar with the patient can provide. Prevention and management of opioid-related adverse events are essential for effective opioid therapy. Providing patient and family education regarding administration, monitoring, and management of opioid therapy is an important nursing role. Lastly, documentation of pain level, functional status, and opioid-related adverse events is required for each contact with the patient, to make this information available to all who assist in the management of the patient's pain. Chronic noncancer pain is an experience that affects all aspects of a patient's life. Effective pain management with long-acting opioids may help the patient to focus on the positive aspects of life, decreasing the focus on pain.\", 3325732: \"It is proposed that the many sets of Regulatory Guidelines for the assessment of chemical carcinogenicity and mutagenicity should be simplified and harmonized in light of current experimental data. Data are discussed which illustrate that an absolute distinction would be drawn between assays conducted in vitro from those in vivo, and that the genotoxicity of a chemical can be adequately defined using a combination of the Salmonella mutation assay and one for the assessment of chromosome aberrations in vitro. It is specifically recommended that once a chemical has shown a clear positive response in vitro, further short-term assays should be conducted in vivo; this avoids considering the 'weight of evidence' of in vitro data, the dangers of which are illustrated. It has now been unequivocally established that not all in vitro genotoxins prove carcinogenic to mammals. It is therefore recommended that all new in vitro genotoxins should be assessed in vivo using the mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay, and if a negative response is observed, a liver genotoxicity test. At present an assay for the induction of unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) in the liver is the most well developed for this purpose. Current data indicate that an in vitro genotoxin found to be inactive in these two in vivo assays will be neither carcinogenic nor mutagenic to the germ cells of mammals. Equally, genotoxicity produced in mammals indicates a carcinogenic and mutagenic potential which can usually only be countered by appropriate chronic bioassays. The use of short-term in vivo assays in this critical role requires attention to the selection of appropriate dose-levels and routes of exposure - these issues are discussed. The above testing strategy will not detect certain animal carcinogens, some of which are specifically discussed. These carcinogens have been variously referred to in the literature as epigenetic/non-genotoxic/hormonal/toxic/ambiguous or ambivalent carcinogens. It is suggested that they present a minor potential hazard to man when compared with that of genotoxic carcinogens and that their short-term detection can only be achieved by the development of new whole mammal assays employing non-genetic endpoints. This is in contrast to the present tendency to employ additional genotoxicity assays for their detection in the unjustified belief that they possess an exquisite specificity of genotoxic action. This article represents a personal view, but the testing strategy proposed is based to a large extent on the original three-tier approach of Bridges.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\", 18772273: 'The steady increase in the number of radiologic procedures being performed is undeniably having a beneficial impact on healthcare. However, it is also becoming common practice to quantify the health detriment from radiation exposure by calculating the number of cancer-related deaths inferred from the effective dose delivered to a given patient population. The inference of a certain number of expected deaths from the effective dose is to be discouraged, but it remains important as a means of raising professional awareness of the danger associated with ionizing radiation. The risk associated with a radiologic examination appears to be rather low compared with the natural risk. However, any added risk, no matter how small, is unacceptable if it does not benefit the patient. The concept of diagnostic reference levels should be used to reduce variations in practice among institutions and to promote optimal dose indicator ranges for specific imaging protocols. In general, the basic principles of radiation protection (eg, justification and optimization of a procedure) need to be respected to help counteract the unjustified explosion in the number of procedures being performed.', 26965802: UnicodeElement(u'Carotid artery stenting (CAS) has emerged as an alternative to carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in patients at high risk for complications from surgery.

Four goal aspects are differentiated: status vs. processdiagnostics, normoriented vs. criterionoriented diagnostic, testing vs. inventarization, measurement of true scores vs. decision oriented diagnostic. Every diagnostic procedure is characterized by a specific personality theory and theory of measurement (classical vs. probabilistic test model). The diagnostic procedures traditionally used for evaluating drugs prefer status diagnostic, normoriented diagnostic, testing and measurement of true scores. Similar one-sidedness in personality theory and theory of measurement restrict validity and usefulness of psychological tests. In clinical practice we find a theoretically and empirically unjustified restriction in the selection of measurement devices on ratings and questionnaires. If we suppose multidimensionality of drug induced changes, we must apply a multimethod approach in outcome studies and use beside ratings and questionnaires behavior observations, objective tests, psychophysiological and neurophysiological measures. We propose a descriptive taxonomy of methods for planning multimethod outcome and process studies. From this taxonomy the methods of measurement for effects and side effects of drugs may be derived. The necessity of the multimethod approach is confirmed by empirical research. With this concept, the following neglected research questions become more obvious: concordance and discordance, synchrony and desynchrony of methods of measurement.

We aimed to reduce the rate of BCC by educational intervention. In parallel, we also strove to expand the use of aminoglycosides (AMG) and reduce the utilization of beta-lactam antibiotics. The rate of BCC was assessed prospectively in the study department - the Emergency Department (ED) and in control departments - Medical Departments A, B and Geriatrics. Data was collected continuously during the study period and educational interventions were performed in the ED but not in the control departments. The intervention included meetings with ED staff, emphasizing proper blood culture collection technique, and post-intervention result updates. The utilization of AMG was encouraged in cases of suspected gram-negative bacteremia. The empirical and definitive antibiotic regimen was assessed. During the study period, a 30% decrease in BCC rate [33/564 (5.9%) to 30/734 (4.1%), p=0.143] was noted in the study department whereas a small increase in BCC rate was noted in the control departments. Logistic regression analysis revealed significantly different trends in BCC rate between the study and control departments (p<0.001). Additionally, an increase in AMG utilization was observed (7% to 40%) in patients with suspected gram-negative bacteremia with normal renal function (p=0.16).

Immunoassays have become increasingly sensitive, specific and reproducible, so that clinicians have great confidence in their results. However, they do not always yield correct results because interferences still occur. In the first part of this review, immunoassay interferences are described and their mechanisms explained: matrix effects, specificity defaults, interferences from antibodies and binding proteins, or the hook effect. The hormones most frequently concerned by these pitfalls are reviewed, even as strategies used to prevent and minimize interferences. In the second part, the consequences of failure to recognize an interference are reviewed: unjustified clinical decisions (wrong diagnosis, treatment, surgery) and, more exceptionally, publication in the scientific literature of erroneous results. Clinicians may sometimes inform laboratories of an increased risk of interference. In general, clinicians are in the best position to fully validate test results; because only they know all the medical data about their patients. If there is any suspicion of discrepancy between clinical and laboratory data, they must alert the laboratory. This is the only way to better detect and, if possible, eliminate interferences and their regrettable outcomes.', 1433407: 'As the number of preventable trauma-related deaths plateaus as a result of trauma system development, new directions for quality improvement in trauma care must come from analyzing morbidity with standardized methods to establish thresholds for provider-related and disease-specific complications. To establish such thresholds and determine priorities for improvements in quality all trauma patients who died, who were admitted to the ICU or OR, who were hospitalized for more than 3 days, or who were interfacility transfers to an academic trauma service, were concurrently evaluated for 1 year. All complication events were defined, reviewed, tabulated, and classified using 135 categories of complications. These categories were subdivided into provider-specific and disease-specific complications. Provider-related complications were classified as justified or unjustified to allow identification of events with a potential for improvement. A total of 1108 patients were admitted (mean ISS, 17); there were 97 deaths. Three potentially preventable deaths were identified, 857 complication events were identified, and 285 provider-related complications were responsible for errors with potential for improvement in 59 events (21%). Disease-specific morbidity was primarily related to infection; pneumonia accounted for 36% of all infectious complications and systemic infection for only 8.6% of infectious complications. Organ failure and other major systemic complications occurred in 2%-8% of patients. This type of analysis forms the basis on which to determine thresholds of provider-specific and disease-specific morbidity in a trauma hospital and serves as a guide to direct efforts toward continuous quality improvement.', 23922496: u'At present there is no cure for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, some nonpharmacologic treatments, such as rehabilitation and lung volume reduction surgery, as well as pharmacologic intervention, can relieve some of the patient\\'s symptoms and improve quality of life, while also reducing the rate of exacerbations and hospitalizations. There needs to be a paradigm shift away from the unjustified nihilistic approach to COPD towards considering it a preventable and treatable disease. After patients quit smoking and start to lead healthier lifestyles, long-acting bronchodilators, such as long-acting beta-adrenergic agents (LABA) and long-acting antimuscarinic agents (LAMA), are recommended as the cornerstone of treatment for COPD, either as monotherapy or in combination. COPD is characterized by a reduced maximum expiratory flow and slow forced emptying of the lungs, which progress over time and are not completely reversible. In this condition, gas gets trapped in the lungs and pulmonary hyperinflation occurs. LABA and LAMA improve airway patency and deflate the lungs. Indacaterol is the first once-daily LABA approved for treatment of COPD, and is administered by inhalation through the Breezhaler\\xae device. The speed of bronchodilation is similar to that with salbutamol (ie, about five minutes) and longer (ie, 24 hours) than that with traditional LABA, with the same 12-hour effect as salmeterol and formoterol, both of which require twice-daily administration. This is why indacaterol has been called the \"ultra-LABA\". On the one hand, the fast onset of action provides immediate relief of symptoms, and on the other, its constant 24-hour bronchodilation provides \"pharmacologic stenting\" which facilitates lung emptying, thereby decreasing trapped gas and pulmonary hyperinflation. Once-daily administration of a fast and long-acting bronchodilator can improve patient adherence with therapy, which is known to be a major problem for many medical treatments. Dose-finding trials have shown that 75 \\u03bcg is the minimum dose needed to achieve clinically important improvement. However, indacaterol 150 \\u03bcg and 300 \\u03bcg achieve an even greater improvement in lung function and patient-oriented outcomes. Further, these two doses of indacaterol significantly reduce pulmonary hyperinflation, thereby improving exercise tolerance and ability to perform day-to-day activities. It is more effective on lung volumes at the 300 \\u03bcg dose than formoterol, and better than salmeterol and tiotropium at the 150 \\u03bcg dose, at least in the acute setting. It is noteworthy that few studies document these results in patients with COPD and moderate airflow obstruction. These are exactly the kind of patients our research should be concentrating on, in view of the accelerated decay in forced expiratory volume in one second at this stage of the disease. Finally, all the relevant studies show that indacaterol is consistently well tolerated by patients with COPD at every stage, and that it has a high safety profile.', 12619585: 'Only in Saint Petersburg the application of omeprazole, hiconcil and fromilid in the treatment of adult patients with duodenal ulcer could save up to 26 million rubles per year due to the decrease in the number of recurrences.

The above-mentioned calculations provide a ground for reflections on the improvement of methods of advanced training for specialists with the use of pharmacoepidemiological and pharmacoeconomic grounds for the selection of optimum remedies for the treatment of duodenal ulcer.

This study compared the extrinsic contamination rate in blood cultures when the needle was and was not changed. One hundred eight medical students obtained 182 blood specimens from each other by means of standard methods. Each specimen was inoculated into two culture bottles. The first bottle was inoculated with the needle used for phlebotomy, and the second was inoculated after needle change. Four (2.2%) of 182 bottles were contaminated when the needle was not changed, compared with one (0.6%) when the needle was changed. This small difference was not statistically significant, and the likelihood of having failed to detect a 5% difference in contamination rate was small.

Off-label, in the strictest sense of the term, is defined as all prescriptions that do not correspond to the summary of product characteristics (SPC), particularly those that fail to comply with the indications and dosage regimens defined by the marketing authorization (MA) for clear safety reasons. There are various rasons for off-label prescriptions, both conscious and unconscious. They are intended to respond to unmet medical needs, the needs of poorly studied populations or not studied at all in trials, but in relation to whom it is reasonable to extrapolate that MA would be given (common-sense prescriptions) and, additionally, to urgent public health needs (such as baclofen, pregnant women, and HIV drugs). All these prescriptions would deserve to be studied for a potential MA. However, there are off-label prescriptions that need to be restricted or even penalized in the case of compassionate prescriptions or unjustified prescriptions or prescriptions not based on any scientific grounds. Off-label prescriptions are not easy to track down because if the prescriber has to write \"off-label\" on his prescription, then clearly, in practice, he will only do so in exceptional cases. Neither the pharmacists who dispense the drug nor the Social Security that reimburses it, have access to the diagnosis (or targeted indication). Thus, in order to identify the off-label prescription, we must be able to cross reference the available databases (such as pharmacovigilance database, medicalized information system program [programme de m\\xe9dicalisation des syst\\xe8mes d\\'information, PMSI], hospital drug formularies, general sample of beneficiaries [\\xe9chantillon g\\xe9n\\xe9raliste de b\\xe9n\\xe9ficiaires, EGB] or national inter-regional Health Insurance Information System [syst\\xe8me national d\\'informations inter-r\\xe9gions d\\'Assurance maladie, SNIIRAM], sales data, and data from market surveys). The shared computerized patient file may resolve this problem. The temporary use recommendation (TUR) proposed by the Drug Safety Law will only partially deal with this problem for recently marketed molecules. This temporary and exceptional mechanism will authorize a recognized off-label prescription, which may be reimbursed and monitored for 3 years. These TURs will only concern a small portion of \"off-label\" drugs having yet a positive risk/benefit ratio (conditional MA) but this is far from matching with majority of off-label prescriptions. As such, and in order to improve the use of drugs, it is important to propose a control system for all \"off-label\" prescriptions with a dedicated committee: the \"off-label\" committee which would determine the frame of the \"off-label\" prescriptions.', 8490838: StringElement('Although radical cystectomy is accepted by most urologists as the treatment of choice for invasive carcinoma of the bladder and age alone is not considered a contraindication for radical surgery, many consider radical major operations to be unsuitable for elderly patients.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'BACKGROUND', u'Label': u'BACKGROUND'}), 20541273: StringElement('FDG-PET/CT has proven to be useful in the staging process of esophageal tumours.

Embracing the trope of \"promise\" in pharmacogenomics alongside the idea of using race as a useful interim proxy for genetic variation raises concerns that new diagnostic and therapeutic interventions may reflect or be mapped upon existing social categories of race, class, gender, and ethnicity in a harmful or dangerous manner.

While there is a concerted effort to quantify uncertainty in risk assessments, the uncertainty due to intertest variability in species effect measurements is an overlooked component. The European Union Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) guidance document suggests that multiple toxicity records for a given chemical-species combination should be aggregated by the geometric mean. Ignoring this issue or applying unjustified so-called harmonization methods weakens the defensibility of uncertainty quantification and interpretation about properties of ecological models, for example, the predicted no-effect concentration. In the present study, the authors propose a simple and broadly theoretically justifiable model to quantify intertest variability and analyze it using Bayesian methods. The value of data in ecotoxicity databases is maximized by using (interval-)censored data. An exploratory analysis is provided to support the model. The authors conclude, based on a large ecotoxicity database of acute effects to aquatic species, that the standard deviation of intertest variability is approximately a factor (or fold-difference) of 3.

Retrospective analysis of three data points in September 2014, January 2015, and February 2015 showed that on average, about a quarter (24%) of routine surgical pathology cases (26%, 19%, and 27% respectively) are not reported on time and do not meet the accepted level of the College of American Pathologists' (CAP) standard turnaround time, which states at least 90% of routine surgical pathology cases should be reported and verified within two days. Our daily observation supported by a root cause analysis exercise revealed that subprocesses including slide allocation and delivery to pathologists, slide review by pathologists, report editing by transcriptionists, and report verification by pathologists are where most delays occur. Thus, to tackle these process issues we developed a quality improvement project using the model of improvement methods to streamline the sample flow process and avoid unjustified reporting delay. The improvement ideas included developing a time log sheet to be attached with all pathology requests, and sending a daily reminder email followed by a phonecall to all pathologists to verify completed reports on the same day. These intervention elements were tested using multiple PDSA cycles resulting in a very noticeable improvement, with more than 94% of all routine cases reported in less than two days, meeting and exceeding the CAP standards. Such noticeable improvement in turnaround of surgical pathology reports will eventually lead to improving the quality and safety of patient care outcome, including diagnosing patients on time, developing the appropriate treatment plan, and avoiding unjustified complications resulting in morbidity and mortality due to delayed reports.\", 21509994: 'Stigma associated with tuberculosis (TB) is often regarded as a barrier to health seeking and a cause of social suffering. Stigma studies are typically patient-centred, and less is known about the views of communities where patients reside. This study examined community perceptions of TB-related stigma. A total of 160 respondents (80 men and 80 women) without TB in the general population of Western Maharashtra, India, were interviewed using Explanatory Model Interview Catalogue interviews with same-sex and cross-sex vignettes depicting a person with typical features of TB. The study clarified features of TB-related stigma. Concealment of disease was explained as fear of losing social status, marital problems and hurtful behaviour by the community. For the female vignette, heredity was perceived as a cause for stigmatising behaviour. Marital problems were anticipated more for the male vignette. Anticipation of spouse support, however, was more definite for men and conditional for women, indicating the vulnerability of women. Community views acknowledged that both men and women with TB share a psychological burden of unfulfilled social responsibilities.

Such a distinction is important for effective community-based interventions for early diagnosis of TB and successful treatment.', 10983276: \"The impact of the environment (air, water, food pollution) on health is a major concern in contemporary society. Unfortunately, there are relatively few objective epidemiological data on this subject and their accuracy is limited. Risks are often not quantified, whereas in public health the quantitative assessment of the various risks and benefits must provide the bases for a global strategy. Actual risks should be distinguished from putative risks and, when the risks are putative, an effort should be made to ascertain the upper and lower limits of the risk. The validity of a linear no threshold relationship for assessing putative risks should be discussed and, whenever appropriate, other relationships should be considered. Since emotional reactions often pervade environmental issues, which in turn are exploited for political or commercial reasons, it is not surprising that any statement or action may provoke violent debate. It is serious to underestimate the importance of a risk, since appropriate measures may not be put in place. However, it is equally serious to overestimate it because this can provoke unjustified fears, a pervasive unease, and a rejection of certain technologies, even to the point of discrediting science. It can lead therefore to a questioning of progress by instilling fears about any innovation, as well as facilitating the manipulation of public opinion for financial or ideological reasons, and finally to distortions in budget allocations and public health actions. Confronted with this situation, the Academy's role should be threefold. a) Whenever necessary, point out the need for an increase in appropriate fundamental research. When epidemiological data are uncertain, analyse the cause of these uncertainties and advocate appropriate development in statistical methodologies and epidemiological research, which could ascertain the upper limit of the putative risk. The lack of knowledge often results in public anxiety; this reaction should be investigated and psychosociological research must be encouraged and supported. b) Inform the scientific community and the public; fight against misinformation and sensationalism in the news, and take advantage of the Internet to this end. Encourage openness and transparency in the preparation of scientific reports and dialogue with the stakeholders. c) Better define the role and the place of experts, ensure their independence, monitor their competence and make sure they represent the various fields involved. When reports are conflicting, the Academy should be ready to organize a forum for analysing the roots of these disagreements and to delineate the limits of the uncertainties.\", 19382128: 'Although the threshold of cost effectiveness of medical interventions is thought to be 20 000- 30 000 UK pounds in the UK, and $50 000-$100 000 in the US, it is well known that these values are unjustified, due to lack of explicit scientific evidence.

In the United States and many other countries, it is standard practice that these patients remain hospitalized \"preemptively\" until blood count recovery, owing to the risk for overwhelming infections and bleeding during pancytopenia. This care policy requires hospitalization for an average of 3 to 4 weeks after completion of chemotherapy. However, highly effective oral prophylactic antimicrobials are now available, and transfusion support of outpatients has become routine in recent years. As a result, the care of patients with hematologic malignancies treated with intensive modalities is increasingly shifting from inpatient to outpatient settings. Benefits of this shift could include the reduced need for medical resources (eg, transfusions or intravenous antimicrobial therapy), improved quality of life (QOL), decreased rates of nosocomial infections, and lower costs. Increasing evidence indicates that select AML patients undergoing intensive remission induction or salvage chemotherapy can be discharged early after completion of chemotherapy and followed closely in a well-equipped outpatient facility in a safe and costeffective manner.

Since ample data on body burdens and some results of clinical and epidemiological studies on TCDD have become available, answering this question may now be attempted on the basis of a comparison of animal and human data. Quality of the data and the predictive power of the methods used must be considered, dose-response relationships must be critically evaluated, and body burdens achieved in humans and experimental animals must be taken into account. Pitfalls in attempts to extrapolate data from animal studies to humans and limitations of conclusions to be drawn from epidemiological data on humans are discussed in this presentation.', 27879292: \"Sterilisation requests made by young, child-free adults are frequently denied by doctors, despite sterilisation being legally available to individuals over the age of 18. A commonly given reason for denied requests is that the patient will later regret their decision. In this paper, I examine whether the possibility of future regret is a good reason for denying a sterilisation request. I argue that it is not and hence that decision-competent adults who have no desire to have children should have their requests approved. It is a condition of being recognised as autonomous that a person ought to be permitted to make decisions that they might later regret, provided that their decision is justified at the time that it is made. There is also evidence to suggest that sterilisation requests made by men are more likely to be approved than requests made by women, even when age and number of children are factored in. This may indicate that attitudes towards sterilisation are influenced by gender discourses that define women in terms of reproduction and mothering. If this is the case, then it is unjustified and should be addressed. There is no good reason to judge people's sterilisation requests differently in virtue of their gender.\", 11759488: StringElement('Clinical or critical pathways are a useful tool in the continuous quality improvement.

The degradation processes of various chemical classes of pesticides in plants under different conditions of use are analyzed. Formulas are developed that enable recognition and estimation of residue levels and duration of retention for \"new\" pesticides and \"old\" substances under varying treatment conditions. Estimated data are verified to provide positive assessments of the accuracy of the predictions. Mathematical modeling as a means of perception is stressed. With this method, the outlet value can be controlled by changing such inlet parameters as application rate, frequency of treatments, types of plants, and so on. Residue levels are predicted for different combinations of use conditions in various climatic-geographical regions. The method of estimation also enables the development of important standards such as post-treatment waiting intervals. A more flexible technique can be employed, in which specific periods are established for different plants under various treatment conditions. Thus, both unjustified shortened waiting intervals or unnecessarily elongated intervals periods can be avoided. The greatest value of the modeling approach is that information can be obtained on the degree of potential food contamination and major standards can be developed without the need for extensive experimental use of pesticides under actual conditions. This technique fully considers optimal use conditions for agrochemicals in terms of human requirements and protection of plants. Mathematical modeling protects the environment while enabling the speedy selection of safe parameters for pesticide use conditions nd realization of significant savings in manpower and time. Overall, this estimation method appears to be an efficient link in the broad system of preventing environmental pesticide contamination and protecting human health.', 18265995: 'Although all kinds of medications should be avoided during pregnancy, the majority of pregnant women receive at least one drug and 6% of them during the high-risk period of the first trimester. The aim of the present paper is to discuss the appropriate management of rhinologic and laryngeal conditions that may be encountered during pregnancy. A literature review from Medline and database sources was carried out. Related books and written guidelines were also included. Controlled clinical trials, prospective and retrospective studies, case-control studies, laboratory studies, clinical and systematic reviews, metanalyses, and case reports were analysed. The following drugs are considered relatively safe: beta-lactam antibiotics (with dose adjustment), macrolides (although the use of erythromycin and clarithromycin carries a certain risk), clindamycin, metronidazole (better avoided in the first trimester), amphotericin-B (especially in immunocompromised situations during the second and third trimester) and acyclovir. First-line antituberculous agents isoniazid, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and ciprofloxacine in drug-resistant tuberculosis can be also used. Non-selective NSAIDs (until the 32nd week), nasal decongestants (with caution and up to 7 days), intranasal corticosteroids, with budesonide as the treatment of choice, second generation antihistamines (cetirizine in the third trimester, or loratadine in the second and third trimester), H2 receptor antagonists (except nizatidine) and proton pump inhibitors (except omeprazole) can be used to relieve patients from the related symptoms.

From the authors\\' perspective, CAM prescriptions and most notably the extensive current endeavours to the \"integration\" of CAM into conventional patient care is problematic in several respects. Thus, several CAM measures are used, although no specific effects of medicines can be proved in clinical studies. It is extensively explained that the methods used in this regard are those of evidence-based medicine, which is one of the indispensable pillars of science-oriented medicine. This standard of proof of efficacy is fundamentally independent of the requirement of being able to explain efficacy of a therapy in a manner compatible with the insights of the natural sciences, which is also essential for medical progress. Numerous CAM treatments can however never conceivably satisfy this requirement; rather they are justified with pre-scientific or unscientific paradigms. The high attractiveness of CAM measures evidenced in patients and many doctors is based on a combination of positive expectations and experiences, among other things, which are at times unjustified, at times thoroughly justified, from a science-oriented view, but which are non-specific (context effects). With a view to the latter phenomenon, the authors consider the conscious use of CAM as unrevealed therapeutic placebos to be problematic. In addition, they advocate that academic medicine should again systematically endeavour to pay more attention to medical empathy and use context effects in the service of patients to the utmost.

Although it is generally thought that clinical trials have failed to demonstrate that cardiac rehabilitation prolongs life after a myocardial infarction, analysis of pooled data from all published studies shows that this conclusion is unjustified. (2) Can each individual patient's risk for a future cardiac event be determined? We have developed a method using serial application of Baye 's theorem to determine each patient's risk. By so doing, we can stratify patient groups by previous risk and then assess the effect of cardiac rehabilitation on altering risk without limiting the analysis to subsequent myocardial infarction and cardiac death. (3) Can regression of atherosclerosis be demonstrated? Regression of atherosclerosis has been clearly demonstrated in animal models, but new evidence suggests that it can also occur in human subjects. (4) Do all patients require monitored exercise after a myocardial infarction? Evidence documenting the safety of exercise in patients recovering from a myocardial infarction has resulted in inclusion of sick patients in cardiac rehabilitation programs and exercise of the healthier patients in unmonitored settings. Major changes in cardiac rehabilitation programs are now taking place, with the emphasis moving away from prolongation of life toward improvement in the quality of life. As a result, cardiac rehabilitation is no longer confined to exercise alone; equal emphasis is placed on dietary and psychologic aspects of patient recovery.\", 21274537: 'The strategy employed by a female to sample prospective mates determines the likelihood that a high-quality male is encountered in the search process. In general, the choosiness of females is expected to depend on the variability of quality amongst the males that are sampled. The sequential search strategy is a prominent model of search behavior that involves the use of a threshold criterion to evaluate encountered individuals. In this paper, we show that the stochastic dominance of one distribution of male quality over another at the second order is necessary and sufficient for the optimal threshold criterion to differ under two distributions of male quality when the cost to sample males is held constant and the mean quality of males under each of the distributions is identical. A difference of the variance of male quality between two distributions does not imply that one distribution stochastically dominates the other at the second order and, hence, should not, in general, be used to assess the relative variability of quality amongst prospective mates. The adjustment of the threshold criterion in response to experimental manipulations of the distribution of male quality has been inferred from induced differences of the duration of search or the number of males sampled in the search process. Here we show that such inferences are unjustified. In particular, the difference of the threshold criterion imposed by second-order stochastic dominance does not determine the distribution under which females are expected to sample a larger number of males in the search process.', 17416112: StringElement('To evaluate the quality of antimicrobial drug use in a university hospital medical department (Department of Medicine, University Hospital Rijeka, Croatia) with 279 hospital-beds in wards containing patients from endocrinology, gastroenterology, hematology, clinical immunology, cardiology and coronary care unit, nephrology and pulmonology sections of the hospital.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'OBJECTIVE', u'Label': u'OBJECTIVE'}), 28676019: 'Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease (30% of the general population) and up to 40% of cases advance to the more severe form of the disease: nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is causally related to cirrhosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD). There is no generally accepted effective treatment for NAFLD/NASH. The joint guidelines of the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL), the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) and the European Association for the Study of Obesity (EASO) suggest the \"off label\" use of pioglitazone in patients without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and pioglitazone in subjects with T2DM or vitamin E or their combination for the treatment of NASH; however pioglitazone has considerable limitations: weight gain, bone fractures in women, and heart failure. The aim of this narrative review is to assess the existing evidence supporting statin use for the treatment of NASH and the reduction of the high CVD risk of these patients. Animal data suggest that there is some benefit from statin use in liver histology in models of NASH. In humans, 3 post hoc analyses of randomised controlled trials (n=1,600, n=1,123, n=8,864) suggest that the use of atorvastatin (even in 80 mg/day) has a beneficial effect on NAFLD/NASH, in terms of liver enzyme reduction and ultrasonographic amelioration. Moreover, and most importantly, statin treatment halved CVD morbidity and mortality in statin-treated NAFLD/NASH patients compared with statin-treated participants with normal liver structure and function and reduced by 2/3rds CVD events in comparison with NAFLD/NASH patients that were not on a statin (90% of this population is not on statins because of the unjustified fear for liver damage). Three biopsy studies (n=20, n=107 and n=356) showed that statin treatment had a protective effect on steatosis, steatohepatitis and fibrosis. Data suggest that statin treatment in humans substantially improve or cure NAFLD/NASH, but above all substantially reduce CVD morbidity and mortality.

There was a number of cases of discontinuation of the study (70/115), mainly due to poor discipline in tablet intake in this particular age group. Only 20 cases discontinued the study for medical reasons. No pregnancies occurred, in spite of the fact that tablets were frequently forgotten (11% of cycles).

This includes the necessity to detect thyroid-disrupting chemicals, which may operate through a variety of modes of action, and have potential to impair neurological development in humans, with resulting deficits of individual and social potential. Mindful of these concerns, the consensus favors in vivo models for both hazard characterization (testing) and hazard identification (screening) steps, in order to minimize false negatives. Owing to its obligate dependence on thyroid hormones, it has been proposed that amphibian metamorphosis be used as a generalized vertebrate model for thyroid function in screening batteries for detection of thyroid disrupters. However, it seems unlikely that such an assay would ever fully replace in vivo mammalian assays currently being validated for human health risk assessment: in its current form the amphibian metamorphosis screening assay would not provide capacity for reliably detecting other modes of endocrine-disrupting activity. Conversely, several candidate mammalian screening assays appear to offer robust capacity to detect a variety of modes of endocrine-disrupting activity, including thyroid activity. To assess whether omission of an amphibian metamorphosis assay from an in vivo screening battery would generate false negatives, the response of amphibian and mammalian assays to a variety known thyroid disrupters, as reported in peer-reviewed literature or government agency reports, was critically reviewed. Of the chemicals investigated from the literature selected (41), more had been tested in mammalian studies with thyroid-relevant endpoints (32) than in amphibian assays with appropriate windows of exposure and developmental endpoints (27). One chemical (methoxychlor) was reported to exhibit thyroid activity in an appropriate amphibian assay in the absence of corresponding activity in a suitable mammalian assay, whereas none of the chemicals surveyed were reported as thyroid active in mammalian assays but reported as negative in an appropriate amphibian assay. Given the need for one or more in vivo mammalian assays for screening chemicals for detecting (anti-)estrogenic/(anti-)androgenic activity and effects on steroidogenesis, inclusion of an in vivo amphibian assay specifically to detect thyroid disrupters would likely be as an addition to these mammalian assays. As there is little convincing evidence that an amphibian screening assay would detect significant numbers of thyroid-active chemicals not picked up by mammalian assays, the routine use of an amphibian metamorphosis assay at screening level could introduce unnecessary and unjustified redundancy into chemical safety assessment programs, when there is pressure to reduce animal use in toxicity testing.', 26181571: 'The association between cancer and sarcoidosis is controversial. Some epidemiological studies show an increase of the incidence of cancer in patients with sarcoidosis but only few cases of sarcoidosis following cancer treatment have been reported. We conducted a retrospective case study from internal medicine and oncology departments for patients presenting sarcoidosis after solid cancer treatment. We also performed a literature review to search for patients who developed sarcoidosis after solid cancer. We describe the clinical, biological, and radiological characteristics and outcome of these patients. Twelve patients were included in our study. Various cancers were observed with a predominance of breast cancer. Development of sarcoidosis appeared in the 3 years following cancer and was asymptomatic in half of the patients.

Various manifestations were observed but all patients presented lymph node involvement. Half of the patients required systemic therapy. With a median follow-up of 73 months, no patient developed cancer relapse. Review of the literature identified 61 other patients for which the characteristics of both solid cancer and sarcoidosis were similar to those observed in our series.

This circulating factor probably interacts with the glomerular filtration barrier and is responsible for massive proteinuria. Most patients respond to steroids. However, a considerable proportion of children run a steroid dependent course. Cyclosporine A (CyA) and cyclophosphamide (CyP) have been classical treatment strategies for such cases, but specific toxicity limits the use of these drugs. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), an inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase and thus de novo purine synthesis. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of MMF in steroid dependent NS and in children with nephrotoxicity due to prolonged CyA treatment. While MMF is a well established strategy against steroid dependency, rituximab (RTX) has emerged as a new treatment option in case of calcineurin inhibitor dependency. Non-compliance to steroid therapy can be responsible for multiple relapses and may be misinterpreted as steroid dependency and may therefore lead to unjustified increase of the immunosuppressive treatment. Triamcinolone acetonide, a long acting steroid for intramuscular injection, can replace the usual oral prednisone treatment if non-compliance is suspected. Whereas the treatment of the primary course of INS is well established, steroid dependent and steroid resistant forms are still a challenge for pediatric nephrologists. Both under-treatment with multiple relapses with disease or steroid associated morbidity on the one hand and over-treatment with specific side effects of immunosuppressive drugs may have severe consequences for the patients.

Patients in the catumaxomab group had four paracenteses over a 10-day period, followed by a 6-hour intraperitoneal catumaxomab infusion, while patients in the control group had a single paracentesis. Catumaxomab did not extend median survival time, which was about two months. Methodological biases rule out any conclusions as to whether catumaxomab reduced the number of paracenteses needed during this short survival period. In this trial, 80% of patients treated with catumaxomab experienced serious adverse events, versus 29% of controls, resulting in hospitalisation in respectively about 29% versus 16% of patients.

Formula or not, organizational results will continue to depend on the practice of the art, as well as the science, of management.', 9842667: 'A correct Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) guarantees a successful treatment of subjective symptoms of oestrogen deficiency and an efficient prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis, of cardiovascular diseases and of M. Alzheimer. In non-substituted postmenopausal women, the risk to die from a myocardial infarction is ten times higher than the risk to die from a carcinoma of the breast or the consequences of a fracture of the femoral neck. In spite of this observation, the acceptance is still insufficient because of an unjustified fear of hormone-induced carcinomas. The incidence of a carcinoma of the breast is not higher in women profiting of a HRT by a correct combination of an oestrogen and a progestogen administered up to 5 years than in untreated controls. Although some but not all authors suspect a slight increase of the relative risk of a carcinoma of the breast to approximately 1.5 after > or = 10 years of HRT, the overall mortality of substituted women is clearly inferior to the one of a non-substituted population. However, the final goal of HRT is not prolongation of life, but a better quality of life. Quality of life is often miserable in women treated for breast cancer. The final answer to the question if women after treatment of breast cancer should be allowed to profit of HRT is still open because formal evidence is missing. However, a woman should not be denied HRT if she lived two years without relapse since her primary cancer and if she does not belong to the subgroup where adjuvant treatment by tamoxifen is appropriate. In the future, selective oestrogen receptor modulators may be used in women after breast cancer.', 9365486: StringElement('We evaluated whether early nephrological referral of patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) resulted in improved condition of patients at initiation of maintenance dialysis and in better outcome on dialysis.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'OBJECTIVE', u'Label': u'OBJECTIVES'}), 9549815: 'Assessment of health related quality of life has become an important endpoint in many cancer clinical trials. Because the participants of these trials often experience disease and treatment related morbidity and mortality, non-random missing assessments are inevitable. Examples are presented from several such trials that illustrate the impact of missing data on the analysis of QOL in these trials. The sensitivity of different analyses depends on the proportion of assessments that are missing and the strength of the association of the underlying reasons for missing data with disease and treatment related morbidity and mortality. In the setting of clinical trials of cancer therapy, the assumption that the data are missing completely at random (MCAR) and analyses of complete cases is usually unjustified. Further, the assumption of missing at random (MAR) may also be violated in many trials and models appropriate for non-ignorable missing data should be explored. Recommendations are presented to minimize missing data, to obtain useful documentation concerning the reasons for missing data and to perform sensitivity analyses.', 7299066: 'Ultrasonography is a completely harmless method of examining the eye and the orbit and uses light, inexpensive equipment, within the reach of any ophthalmologist, to provide excellent information concerning the eye and is also well adapted to orbital examination. Cephalic computed tomography, which uses ionizing radiation, is especially efficient in orbital investigations, but this kind of examination is only required in about 10% of cases. It requires expensive, cumbersome equipment and highly specialised staff; frequent use of this method, as well as the injection of contrast products, can be risky. The reader will find 3 tables that summarize briefly the comparative possibilities of ultrasonography and computed tomography in bulbar and orbital investigations and for biometry. A 4th table underlines the suitability of one method or the other in terms of the symptomatology. Consultation of this table could be a time-saver: the ophthalmologist would always begin with the method most likely to give the best information and not waste time doing both. As far as the globe and the orbit are concerned, ultrasonography is normally sufficient. When this method seems problematical or gives insufficient information, the investigation can easily be completed with a computed tomography. Using this method, therefore we can go some way towards limiting the irradiation of the crystalline lens (sometimes unjustified) and towards saving time and money within the Health Service.'}\n"
