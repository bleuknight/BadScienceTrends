      "{1375966: 'Platelet degranulation has been implicated in the pathophysiology of acute arterial thrombosis, intimal hyperplasia, and atherogenesis. Most previous studies that examined the effect of heparin on platelet function have used platelet aggregometry. These studies have resulted in contradictory data and, by the nature of the assay, reveal no information with regard to platelet degranulation. In contrast, flow cytometry allows accurate quantification of the extent of platelet degranulation by measurement of the platelet surface binding of a GMP-140 specific monoclonal antibody (S12). GMP-140 is only expressed on the platelet surface after platelet alpha granule release. In the present study increasing concentrations of heparin were added to whole blood anticoagulated with sodium citrate. Platelets were activated with a panel of agonists, and the extent of platelet degranulation was quantified by whole blood flow cytometry. Heparin concentrations as high as 100 units/ml were found to suppress platelet alpha granule release induced by either a thromboxane A2 analog (U46619) or a combination of adenosine diphosphate and epinephrine. Heparin suppressed alpha granule release induced by thrombin both in whole blood and in washed platelets. The addition of heparin after platelet activation had no effect on S12 binding. In summary, heparin in high concentrations is a potent inhibitor of platelet degranulation, an action that is unrelated to its effect on the coagulation cascade. Although the heparin concentrations used in this study exceed those used clinically by a factor of 10 or more, future studies of heparin fractions may allow the separation of the anticoagulant and antiplatelet properties of the molecule and allow the administration of an agent that selectively suppresses platelet degranulation without the humoral anticoagulant effect.', 23375875: 'A lot of contradictory data regarding the serious side effects of incretin-based therapies are currently available, with more being prepared or published every month. Considering the widespread use of these drugs it should be considered a priority to establish both short- and long-term risks connected with incretin treatment. We performed an extensive literature search of the PubMed database looking for articles dealing with connections between incretin-based therapies and pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, thyroid cancer and other neoplasms. Data obtained indicate that GLP-1 agonists and DPPIV inhibitors could increase the risk of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, possibly due to their capacity to increase ductal cell turnover, which has previously been found to be up-regulated in patients with obesity and T2DM. GLP-1 analogues exenatide and liraglutide seem to be connected with medullary thyroid carcinoma in rat models and, surprisingly, GLP-1 receptors have been found in papillary thyroid carcinoma, currently the most common neoplasm of the thyroid gland in humans. Changes in expression of DPPIV have been described in ovarian carcinoma, melanoma, endometrial adenocarcinoma, prostate cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and in certain haematological malignancies. In most cases loss of DPPIV activity is connected with a higher grading scale, more aggressive tumour behaviour and higher metastatic potential. In conclusion animal and human studies indicate that there could be a connection between incretin-based therapies and pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, thyroid cancer and other neoplasms. Therefore whenever such therapy is started it would be wise to proceed with caution, especially if personal history of neoplasms is present.', 18349572: 'Radiotherapy has been offered to patients with pancreatic cancer, either in the adjuvant or definitive setting. However, the role of radiotherapy in pancreatic cancer is increasingly doubted, especially after the introduction of gemcitabine to both domains. Although contradictory data exist, combined chemoradiotherapy improves both quantity and quality of life for patients with locally advanced tumors compared with radiotherapy alone or chemotherapy alone. Recently, induction chemotherapy strategy is being evaluated for better selection of patients for optimal benefit from consolidative chemoradiotherapy. Much controversy has been suggested concerning the role of adjuvant radiotherapy, but quality assurance for radiotherapy was not considered in the previously reported studies. Combined chemoradiotherapy in the adjuvant setting is still considered as a viable option. Current phase III randomized on-going studies will provide better answers on the role of radiotherapy in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.', 23525894: StringElement('We have investigated whether low-dose vitamin K2 supplements (menaquinone-7, MK-7) could beneficially affect bone health.

The MARs have been cloned either 5' to or at both sides of a reporter gene expression cassette to reconstitute a MAR-based domain. Histochemical staining revealed a new transgene expression pattern in roots of regenerated plants and their progeny. Furthermore, MARs systematically induced variegation. We show here that maize adh-1 MARs are able to modify transgene expression patterns as a heritable trait, giving a new and complementary outcome following use of MARs in genetic transformation.\", 6608912: 'Circulating immune complexes were detected in 20% of serum samples from pregnant patients by the liquid-phase C1q-binding assay.

To investigate the interaction between Rheb and FKBP38, we overexpressed goat Rheb and FKBP38 in goat fetal fibroblasts, extracted whole proteins, and performed coimmunoprecipitation to detect them by western blot. We found Rheb binds directly to FKBP38. Then, we constructed bait vectors (pGBKT7-Rheb/FKBP38) and prey vectors (pGADT7-Rheb/FKBP38), and examined their interaction by yeast two-hybrid assay. Their direct interaction was observed, regardless of which plasmid served as the prey or bait vector. These results indicate that the 2 proteins interact directly in vivo.

However, the three critical unresolved questions about aggressive LDL lowering are the shape of the curve relating cardiac events to LDL, the best surrogate measurement for assessing therapeutic efficacy and the best target for LDL therapy. The relation between cardiac events and LDL is curvilinear, both epidemiologically and during therapy. The benefit of lipid lowering diminishes progressively and becomes difficult to detect at lower LDL levels without a very large sample size. Assessment of the benefits of lipid lowering is further confounded by differences in the level of pretreatment LDL and by the non-LDL lowering effects of statins. Both epidemiologic studies and large randomized clinical trials have produced conflicting results concerning the best LDL target. Failure to reduce the event rate in patients with pretreatment LDL <125 mg (Cholesterol And Recurrent Events [CARE] trial) alerts us to the risk of extrapolating epidemiologic data to clinical practice, yet subset analysis of some clinical trials suggests the greatest benefit appears in those patients with the lowest on-treatment LDL levels (Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study [4S]). This controversy should be resolved in the next few years by several important on-going trials. In the face of seemingly contradictory data from current clinical trials, we can only speculate that very aggressive LDL lowering to <80 mg/dl could be accompanied by a modest therapeutic benefit beyond the current recommendations of the National Cholesterol Education Program. If any benefit is observed, it will have to be balanced against a small potential for increased adverse events.', 28224027: 'H. pylorivirulence factors on IL-8 induction, we aimed to analyze the effect of this diversity on levels of IL-8 secretion in AGS cell line.', 25701466: StringElement('Angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) is a key component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS).

In the case of casein-induced peritoneal inflammation in rabbits, IL-1 beta mRNA expression was found to be limited to the early stage--peaking at 2 h and lasting for only 5 h, a period corresponding to that in which new antigen introduction induces an enhanced immune response. This suggests that IL-1 beta is an inflammation-induced immune potentiation factor. Among 5-h peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) staining with anti-rabbit-IL-1 beta goat antibody, 99% were PMNs. Surprisingly, 9-h and 16-h PECs, which display negative IL-1 activity, also stained for IL-1 beta antigen. This seemingly contradictory data can be explained by the existence of a hypothetical processing protease subject to limited activation, and by a newly isolated 13 kD IL-1 antagonist produced during the later stages of inflammation.', 28744152: '2receptors on the neuronal membrane) are described.', 16715125: 'Aurora-A/STK15/BTAK, which encodes a centrosome-associated kinase, is amplified and overexpressed in multiple types of human tumors, including breast cancer. However, the causal relationship between overexpression of Aurora-A and tumorigenesis has not been fully established due to contradictory data obtained from different experimental systems. To investigate this, we generated a mouse strain that carries an MMTV-Aurora-A transgene. We showed that all the MMTV-Aurora-A mice displayed enhanced branch morphogenesis in the mammary gland and about 40% developed mammary tumors at 20 months of age. The tumor incidence was significantly increased in a p53(+/-) mutation background with about 70% MMTV-Aurora-A;p53(+/-) animals developed tumors at 18 months of age. Of note, overexpression of Aurora-A led to genetic instability, characterized by centrosome amplification, chromosome tetraploidization and premature sister chromatid segregation, at stages prior to tumor formation. Most notably, the severe chromosomal abnormality did not cause cell death owing to the activation of AKT pathway, including elevated levels of phosphorylated AKT and mammalian target of rapamycin, and nuclear accumulation of cyclin D1, which enabled continuous proliferation of the tetraploid cells. These data establish Aurora-A as an oncogene that causes malignant transformation through inducing genetic instability and activating oncogenic pathways such as AKT and its downstream signaling.', 19635247: 'Meibomian glands (MG) secrete an oily substance, meibum, that spreads across the ocular surface and mixes with secretions produced by other ocular structures to create a thin film. The protective efficacy of the tear film is believed to be related to the chemical composition of the lipid layer. We reviewed the literature describing the composition of human MG secretions and have provided an overview on methods of collecting meibum samples, methods of lipid analyses, and the results obtained in previous studies. The usefulness and quality of the data obtained about meibum depend on proper sampling and the analytical techniques used. Historically, several methods have been developed, which have yielded contradictory data regarding meibum sample collection and analytical techniques. Based on review of the literature, the major lipids present in meibum are of nonpolar origin: waxes, sterols, and sterol esters, followed by triacylglycerides and fatty acids. The amphiphilic lipids, diacylglycerides, were reported in fewer studies, and monoacylglycerides were reported in only two. Information on the composition of the polar lipids is more controversial. Meibum phospholipids were found in small amounts (16% or less) in some studies, but not in others. Thus, meibum is a complex mixture of lipid molecules. Historical analytical inconsistencies may be partly explained by limitations of past analytical procedures and by the consideration that the tear film lipid layer may have contributing sources other than meibum.', 28266084: u'Genotoxicity testing plays an important role in the assessment of carcinogenic and heritable risks. In many cases, experts charged with assessing genotoxicity test results need to evaluate widely varying numbers and types of bioassays of differing quality, conducted in a variety of cells and species using a wide range of protocols. The recommendations in this article were initially prepared as general guidelines to assist experts involved in the 2016 Joint Food and Agricultural Organization and World Health Organization Meeting on Pesticide Residues (JMPR) in their evaluation of the human health risks associated with exposure to pesticide residues in the diet. A weight of evidence approach is recommended in which studies are evaluated based on quality, reproducibility and consistency, significance of the genetic alteration, phylogenetic relevance to humans, type (in vivo vs. in vitro), and relevance of the route of administration. Using the recommended approach, the most weight will generally be given to high quality in vivo studies of gene and chromosome mutations (including aberrations) in humans or mammals exposed to the chemical through a physiologically relevant route such as oral or dermal administration or by inhalation. The guidelines are intended to give reviewers flexibility in evaluating all relevant scientific information, and allow them to use their best scientific judgment in reaching conclusions about the significance of the genotoxicity results.

There is a polymorphism (a T-to-C substitution) in the 5'-untranslated region, which may influence the transcription level of CYP17 mRNA. There is a continuing controversy as to whether the variant allele is associated with a subset of breast cancer or polycystic ovary syndrome. In prostate cancer research, there are contradictory data concerning the CYP17 risk allele. We explored the association between CYP17 polymorphism and a risk of prostate cancer or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in a Japanese population. This study included 252 prostate cancer patients, 202 BPH patients, and 131 male controls. A 451-bp fragment encompassing the polymorphic site was amplified by PCR, treated with restriction enzyme MspA1, and electrophoresed on an agarose gel. The MspA1-undigested allele with the published sequence and the MspA1-digested variant allele were designated as A1 and A2, respectively. There was a significant difference (P < 0.05) in the genotypes between prostate cancer patients and male controls, and between BPH patients and male controls. Men with the A1/A1 CYP17 genotype had an increased risk of prostate cancer [odds ratio (OR), 2.57; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.39-4.78] and BPH (OR, 2.44; 95% CI = 1.26-4.72) compared with those with the A2/A2 genotype. Men with the A1/A2 genotype had an intermediate increased risk of prostate cancer (OR, 1.45; 95% CI = 0.84-2.54) and BPH (OR, 1.60; 95% CI = 0.89-2.87) compared with those with the A2/A2 genotype. The trend of an increasing risk of prostate cancer and BPH with an increasing number of the A1 allele was statistically significant (prostate cancer versus male control, P = 0.003; OR, 1.57; 95% CI = 1.16-2.12; BPH versus male control, P = 0.008; OR, 1.55; 95% CI = 1.12-2.13). There was no significant association between the CYP17 genotype and the tumor status (grade and stage) of prostate cancer. Our results suggest that the A1 allele of the CYP17 polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer and BPH, with a gene dosage effect. However, the CYP17 genotype does not seem to influence the disease status in prostate cancer.\", 18374327: 'Adiponectin can suppress atherogenesis by inhibiting the adherence of monocytes, reducing their phagocytic activity, and suppressing the accumulation of modified lipoproteins in the vascular wall. Contradictory data have been reported about the effect of statins on adiponectin plasma levels. In this work, adiponectin plasma levels were measured in 102 statin-free subjects from the Spanish population of the Achieve Cholesterol Targets Fast with Atorvastatin Stratified Titration (ACTFAST) study, a 12-week, prospective, multi-centre, open-label trial which enrolled subjects with coronary heart disease, coronary heart disease-equivalent or a 10-year coronary heart disease risk >20%. Subjects were assigned to atorvastatin (10-80 mg/day) based on low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol concentration at screening. For comparison, age and gender-matched blood donors (N=40) were used as controls. Control subjects did not present hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, metabolic syndrome and history of cardiovascular diseases. Adiponectin levels were diminished in patients at high cardiovascular risk compared with control subjects [4166 (3661-4740) vs 5806 (4764-7075) ng/ml respectively; geometric mean (95% CI); P<0.0001]. In the whole population, atorvastatin treatment increased adiponectin levels [9.7 (3.2-16.7);% Change (95% CI); P=0.003]. This increment was in a dose-dependent manner; maximal effect observed with atorvastatin 80 mg/d [24.7 (5.7-47.1); P=0.01]. Adiponectin concentrations were positively correlated with high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol both before and after atorvastatin treatment. No association was observed between adiponectin and LDL-cholesterol before and after atorvastatin treatment. In conclusion, atorvastatin increased adiponectin plasma levels in subjects at high cardiovascular risk, revealing a novel anti-inflammatory effect of this drug.', 24175162: u\"Due to an ever aging society and growing prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the challenge to meet social and health care system needs will become increasingly difficult. Unfortunately, a definite ante mortem diagnosis is not possible. Thus, an early diagnosis and identification of AD patients is critical for promising, early pharmacological interventions as well as addressing health care needs. The most advanced and most reliable markers are \\u03b2-amyloid, total tau and phosphorylated tau in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In blood, no single biomarker has been identified despite an intense search over the last decade. The most promising approaches consist of a combination of several blood-based markers increasing the reliability, sensitivity and specificity of the AD diagnosis. However, contradictory data make standardized testing methods in longitudinal and multi-center studies extremely difficult. In this review, we summarize a range of the most promising CSF and blood biomarkers for diagnosing AD.\", 24999483: 'Rodent models are an indispensable tool for studying etiology and progress of depression. Since interrelated systems of neurotrophic factors and cytokines comprise major regulatory mechanisms controlling normal brain plasticity, impairments of these systems form the basis for development of cerebral pathologies, including mental diseases. The present review focuses on the numerous experimental rodent models of depression induced by different stress factors (exteroceptive and interoceptive) during early life (including prenatal period) or adulthood, giving emphasis to the data on the changes of neurotrophic factors and neuroinflammatory indices in the brain. These parameters are closely related to behavioral depression-like symptoms and impairments of neuronal plasticity and are both gender- and genotype-dependent. Stress-related changes in expression of neurotrophins and cytokines in rodent brain are region-specific. Some contradictory data reported by different groups may be a consequence of differences of stress paradigms or their realization in different laboratories. Like all experimental models, stress-induced depression-like conditions are experimental simplification of clinical depression states; however, they are suitable for understanding the involvement of neurotrophic factors and cytokines in the pathogenesis of the disease-a goal unachievable in the clinical reality. These major regulatory systems may be important targets for therapeutic measures as well as for development of drugs for treatment of depression states.', 23380028: StringElement('We examine the extent to which ClinicalTrials.gov is meeting its goal of providing oversight and transparency of clinical trials with human subjects.

Drugs binding and activating PPARs are therefore attracting attention for their potential therapeutic role in various diseases like type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemias, atherosclerosis, obesity (i.e., metabolic syndrome). Agonists of these receptors have been already used in therapeutic protocols: fibrates (PPAR-alpha ligands) are being used in hyperlipidemias, and thiazolidinediones (mainly PPAR-gamma ligands) are being employed as insulin sensitizers. The latter drugs introduction into therapy, however, showed very soon some unwanted effects (hepatotoxicity at first and myocardiotoxicity later on) which confirmed some contradictory data already suggested by pre-clinical trial-experiments. In this study we show that some PPAR ligands impair mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in human liver cell line mainly by deranging NADH oxidation. Intriguingly, the PPAR-gamma ligand ciglitazone caused a dose-dependent inhibition of NADH-cytochrome c reductase that resulted, at a drug concentration of 50 microM, of about 60% (P<0.001), while other PPAR ligands with different receptor affinity - positive controls like clofibrate (0.7 mM), gemfibrozil (0.23 mM) and bezafibrate (1 mM) - reduced the activity of mitochondrial Complex I by about 20% (P<0.01, P<0.01 and P<0.05, respectively). The induced mitochondrial dysfunction imposed a series of metabolic compensatory adaptations characterized by a significant shift to anaerobic glycolysis. These findings underline the undervalued non-genomic effects of PPAR ligands and can provide a better understanding of the pharmacotoxicological profiles of these drugs and of their roles in the therapy of diabetes mellitus.', 7552067: 'The role of T lymphocytes in the pathology of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is controversial. To some extent this has resulted from contradictory data, but even where specific points of fact are not in dispute, their interpretation often is. Nevertheless, the basic idea of a pathological T cell response in RA receives significant support from the work of several groups who have removed them by thoracic duct drainage, lymphapheresis or total lymphoid irradiation (TLI). Each of these procedures ameliorates RA; in the case of TLI which induces a profound and sustained decrease in CD4+ cells, the effect on synovitis was prolonged. These observations are in line with the general assumption that the strong association of RA with HLA-DR molecules containing a particular conserved region of amino acids implies an important role for T cells in RA, since the physiological role of HLA-DR molecules is to present antigens to T cells. In addition the association with Dw4 and related alleles is strongest for the most severe and persistent forms of disease, arguing that T cells may be important not just in initiation of RA but also in its perpetuation. However, the infiltrating T cells seem to be remarkably inactive and as a population to lack specificity for any particular antigen, leading some to conclude that their role is either passive or irrelevant, while others contend that it is precisely this inactivity which is responsible for the persistence of RA.', 3731526: 'Soluble immune complexes (IC) are known to bind to human red blood cells (HRBC). Most authors have attributed this binding to the interaction between IC-bound C3b and a red cell CR1 receptor, but contradictory data has been published concerning the ability of IC to bind to HRBC in the absence of complement. Using soluble tetanus toxoid-rabbit anti-tetanus toxoid (TT-ATT) IC, we have shown that binding through the CR1 receptor takes place when IC are formed at antibody excess, while IC formed at antigen excess do not require complement for erythrocyte binding. Once absorbed to HRBC, IC are recognized by CR1 and/or Fc receptors on phagocytic cells. This interaction is not associated with red cell engulfment, but using radiolabelled S. aureus protein A as a probe, we have demonstrated the transfer of IC from HRBC to phagocytic cells. Such transfer without red blood cell (RBC) damage agrees with the postulated role of RBC in the elimination of soluble IC from circulation. However, we have also demonstrated that the interaction between HRBC-IC and phagocytic cells is associated with the release of mediators of inflammation. It is, therefore, not absolutely clear whether the interaction of RBC-adsorbed IC and phagocytic cells will always have beneficial consequences.', 835143: 'The frequency of thromboses or of obstacles to the venous flow in brachial or axillary regions has been examined by a phlebographic survey of 102 patients who were treated surgically and radiotherapeutically because of cancers of the breast.

Further 15 suffered from an obstruction to the venous flow. The results are discussed in detail, and compared with the rather contradictory data in literature.

Simultaneous urodynamic, neurophysiological, and radiological examinations employed during our studies enabled us to determine changes in these parameters due to FEX. Among a large number of patients with urinary incontinence (for example: paraplegics, patients with spina bifida, stress incontinence following prostate operations, or resistant enuresis) we have determined that FES is appropriate if applied to properly selected patients. FES is indicated on the basis of the following criteria: the degree of morphological lesion of the urinary tract, the peripheral denervation of the muscles of the pelvic floor, the condition of the spinal center for miction, and, above all the quality of response to FES. FES not only activates the closing muscles of the bladder, but also inhibits the reflex contractions of the detrusor. Here, it should be noted that FES is indicated for cases of reflex incontinence. During FES of the pelvic floor muscles intravesical pressure normally diminishes and the reflex contractions of the detrusor subside. Sometimes, however, the reflex of miction occurs. In such a case, two reflex mechanisms are engaged. Their equilibrium, i.e. controlled miction, can be achieved with an afferent in flow which inhibits the reflex of miction. The use of FES for the correction of urinary incontinence can be a very good method if the FES parameters are individually chosen and patients properly selected.', 333397: 'Contradictory data have recently been published from two different laboratories on the presence vs absence of an intrinsic endonucliolytic activity of E. coli exonuclease III at apurinic sites in double-stranded DNA.

Hyperphagia and obesity develop after an initial phase of poor feeding and failure to thrive. Several mechanisms for the aetiology of obesity in PWS are proposed, which include disruption in hypothalamic pathways of satiety control resulting in hyperphagia, aberration in hormones regulating food intake, reduced energy expenditure because of hypotonia and altered behaviour with features of autism spectrum disorder. Profound muscular hypotonia prevents PWS patients from becoming physically active, causing reduced muscle movements and hence reduced energy expenditure. In a quest for the aetiology of obesity, recent evidence has focused on several appetite-regulating hormones, growth hormone, thyroid hormones and plasma adipocytokines. However, despite advancement in understanding of the genetic basis of PWS, there are contradictory data on the role of satiety hormones in hyperphagia and data regarding dietary intake are limited. Mechanistic studies on the aetiology of obesity and its relationship with disease pathogenesis in PWS are required. .

Lymphocytes were passively sensitized with IgM anti-SRBC molecules at 4 degrees C, added to SRBC monolayers then incubated at 37 degrees C with guinea pig complement to develop the plaques. The PFC assay has methodological advantages over rosetting methods which demonstrate IgM receptors, and under certain conditions is more sensitive than these rosette techniques. A mean of 17% of freshly isolated uncultured lymphocytes, enriched for B cells, formed direct plaques while a mean of 3% of T-enriched preparations formed direct plaques. However, if the lymphocytes were preincubated with vibrio cholerae neuraminidase (VCN) these figures increased to 46% and 35% respectively. The specificity of plaque formation by VCN-treated lymphocytes was established. SRBC sensitized with a F(ab')2 preparation of an IgG anti-SRBC reagent failed to bind to VCN-treated lymphocytes, inclusion of IgM, but not other Ig molecules in the test medium, inhibited plaque formation, and, most important, plaque formation by T and B cells was inhibited by F(c)5 mu but not by Fab mu fragments. These results indicate that T and B lymphocytes express IgM-class specific membrane receptors, that these receptors may be hidden on normal lymphocytes but are revealed by treatment with VCN and that the IgM receptor on VCN-treated lymphocytes is F(c)mu specific. These findings are discussed briefly with regard to other and partly contradictory data obtained after overnight in vitro lymphocyte culture.

The aim of the present study was to reconcile these contradictory data in order to define the role of anterior pituitary hormones in the thymus. The results indicated that if female dw/dw mice are housed together with their normal-sized littermates, thymic cellularity and the frequency of CD4(+)CD8(+) thymocytes are markedly reduced. However, administration of growth hormone could reverse these decreases seen in the double-positive T progenitor cells.

Of these, 5-20% will have Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB).

To determine the role of microtubule integrity in stimulus-response coupling elicited by two different mechanisms, i.e., engagement of the Fc receptors (FcR gamma II, FcR gamma III) or engagement of the receptor for FMLP, we utilized colchicine (10 microM), which reduces pericentriolar microtubules to 29% of control, and compared its effect with that of nocodazole (50 microM) and lumicolchicine (10 microM). We now demonstrate that treatment of neutrophils with colchicine but not lumicolchicine, inhibits degranulation elicited by engagement of Fc receptors but augments degranulation in response to FMLP. In contrast to the ligand-specific effect of microtubule-disruption on degranulation, superoxide anion production (assembly of the NADPH oxidase) is unaffected by colchicine regardless of the ligand. To determine whether intact microtubules were required for responses elicited by ligation of Fc gamma RII(CD32) or Fc gamma RIII(CD16), mAb directed against these receptors were employed. Treatment of neutrophils with mAb KuFc79 directed against Fc gamma RII(CD32) or mAb 3G8 directed against Fc gamma RIII(CD16) inhibited degranulation of neutrophils elicited by immune complexes (IC). In contrast, removal of most of Fc gamma RIII by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C did not significantly alter degranulation in response to IC. We conclude that degranulation elicited by IC results from ligation of both Fc gamma RII and phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C-insensitive Fc gamma RIII. The importance of microtubule integrity on the generation of intracellular signals was also examined. Degranulation of neutrophils proceeds via pertussis toxin-sensitive and insensitive pathways; treatment of cells with colchicine did not augment the action of pertussis toxin. Stimulation of neutrophils by chemoattractants results in a biphasic increase in 1,2-sn-diacylglycerol; a rapid increase (\"triggering\") secondary to the action of a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, and a late increase (\"activation\") secondary to the action of a phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C. Treatment of cells with colchicine altered the production of both [3H]-arachidonic acid-diacylglycerol and diacyl[14C]glycerol in parallel to its effect on degranulation. These studies indicate that the requirement of intact microtubules for degranulation is ligand-specific. Furthermore, assembly of the respiratory burst oxidase does not require intact microtubules. Microtubules most likely alter the cycling of specific receptors or the generation of specific intracellular signals required for stimulus-response coupling in the course of degranulation.

Variables assessed have included recipient age, gender, and social support network. How recipients respond to having the device, particularly after experiencing firing, has been evaluated in light of new depression and anxiety disorder diagnoses as well as premorbid personality structure. Now the picture of what is known is, if anything, cloudier than it was 2 years ago, with little definitive and much contradictory data emerging in most of these categories. It still seems clear that in a significant minority of ICD recipients the device negatively affects quality of life, probably more so if it fires. Education about life with the device before receiving it remains paramount. Reports continue to appear of patients developing new-onset diagnosable anxiety disorders such as panic and posttraumatic stress disorder. Until recently the strongest predictors of induced psychopathology were considered to be the frequency and recency of device firing. It now seems that preimplantation psychologic variables such as degree of optimism or pessimism and an anxious personality style may confer an even greater risk than previously thought. Certainly many variables factor into the induction of psychopathology in these patients. Among these factors are age, gender, and perception of control of shocks, as well as the predictability of shocks and psychologic attributions made by the patient regarding the device. Another source of variability is this population's medical heterogeneity. Some patients receive ICDs after near-death experiences; others get them as anticipatory prophylaxis. Some have longstanding and entrenched heart disease; others were apparently healthy before sudden dangerous arrhythmias. Diagnoses as diverse as myocardial infarction in the context of advanced coronary artery disease and dilated cardiomyopathy after acute viral infection may warrant ICD placement. Moreover the course of cardiac disease after ICD placement may vary from relative stability to continuing disease progression and severe functional compromise. Unless these and other pre- and postimplantation differences are taken into account, it is almost impossible to make meaningful comparisons between studies. Ideally, future research would consist either of large-scale, randomized, prospective studies using validated structured-interview tools to supplement a literature dominated by self-report measures, unstructured assessments, and anecdotal reports, or of smaller studies designed to focus on particular diagnostic subsets. As ICDs become the standard of care for potentially life-threatening arrhythmias, the rate of implantations continues to increase. Because negative emotions have been linked to an increased incidence of arrhythmias, and untreated or unrecognized psychiatric illness can interfere with adaptation to an ICD, assessing and managing both pre-existing and induced psychiatric disorders becomes even more critical. Greater research attention should be paid to determining which patients meet criteria for anxiety disorders before and after implantation and what premorbid traits predispose to postimplantation psychopathology. The authors predict that psychiatrists will be involved increasingly in caring for this population, offering insights into treatment options that increase the likelihood of successful ICD acceptance and decrease the psychosocial costs of these devices.\", 10974484: \"Data accumulated in the last decade indicate that nitric oxide (NO) participates in the regulation of neurotransmission in the central nervous system.

Since NO is a potential nonsynaptic modulator, it may have an important role in the regulation of monoaminergic systems.

It has also resulted in the impression that high concentrations of dietborne Cu and Zn (e.g. > 900 mg kg(-1) dry diet) are relatively non-toxic to fish. We re-analyzed existing data using rations and dietborne metal concentrations and used daily dose, species and life stage to define the toxicity of dietborne Cu and Zn to fish. Partly because of insufficient information we were unable to find consistent relationships between metal toxicity in laboratory-prepared diets and any other factor including, supplemented metal compound (e.g. CuSO(4) or CuCl(2)), duration of metal exposure, diet type (i.e. practical, purified or live diets), or water quality (flow rates, temperature, hardness, pH, alkalinity). For laboratory-prepared diets, dietborne Cu toxicity occurred at daily doses of > 1 mg kg(-1) body weight d(-1) for channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), 1-15 mg kg(-1) body weight d(-1) (depending on life stage) for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and 35-45 mg kg(-1) body weight d(-1) for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). We found that dietborne Zn toxicity has not yet been demonstrated in rainbow trout or turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) probably because these species have been exposed to relatively low doses of metal ( < 90 mg kg(-1) body weight d(-1)) and effects on growth and reproduction have not been analyzed. However, daily doses of 9-12 mg Zn kg(-1) body weight d(-1) in laboratory-prepared diets were toxic to three other species, carp Cyprinus carpio, Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus, and guppy Poecilia reticulata. Limited research indicates that biological incorporation of Cu or Zn into a natural diet can either increase or decrease metal bioavailability, and the relationship between bioavailability and toxicity remains unclear. We have resolved the contradictory data surrounding the effect of organic chelation on metal bioavailability. Increased bioavailability of dietborne Cu and Zn is detectable when the metal is both organically chelated and provided in very low daily doses. We have summarized the information available on the effect of phosphates, phytate and calcium on dietborne Zn bioavailability. We also explored a rationale to understand the relative importance of exposure to waterborne or dietborne Cu and Zn with a view to finding an approach useful to regulatory agencies. Contrary to popular belief, the relative efficiency of Cu uptake from water and diet is very similar when daily doses are compared rather than Cu concentrations in each media. The ratio of dietborne dose:waterborne dose is a good discriminator of the relative importance of exposure to dietborne or waterborne Zn. We discuss gaps in existing data, suggest improvements for experimental design, and indicate directions for future research.', 24112782: 'A comprehensive study on the biomechanical response of human brain tissue is necessary to investigate traumatic brain injury mechanisms. Published brain material property studies have been mostly performed under a specific type of loading, which is insufficient to develop accurate brain tissue constitutive equations. In addition, inconsistent or contradictory data in the literature made it impossible for computational model developers to create a single brain material model that can fit most, if not all, experimental results. In the current study, a total of 240 brain tissue specimens were tested under tension (n=72), compression (n=72), and shear (n=96) loading modes at varying strain rates. Gray-white matter difference, regional difference, and directional difference within white matter were also investigated. Stress-strain relationships of human brain tissue were obtained up to 50% of engineering strain. Strain rate dependency was observed under all three loading modes. White matter was stiffer than gray matter in compression and shear. Corona radiata was found to be stiffer than cortex, thalamus, and corpus callosum in tension and compression. Directional dependency of white matter was observed under shear loading.', 22115949: 'Lewis (LEW) and Fischer (FIS) inbred rats were used to study the relationship of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis reactivity with inflammation-related pain behavior. LEW rats are susceptible to the development of autoimmune and chronic inflammatory disorders, whereas FIS rats are resistant. Since contradictory data have previously been collected under conditions of acute inflammation, we investigated the onset and maintenance of thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia and spinal activation of neurons and glia cells in a model of ongoing inflammation in both strains. Hind paw volumes and mechanical and thermal pain thresholds were measured prior to and during one week after intraplantar injection of carrageenan. The activation of nociceptive neurons (FosB), astroglia (GFAP) and microglia (OX-42) in the spinal cord of segments L5/L6 was assessed using immunohistochemistry. Inflammation increased paw volume, pain sensitivity and cell activation in both strains. FIS rats were more sensitive to sensory stimulation and developed a more severe edema on day 1, but recovered faster up to day 7 than LEW rats. At that time a higher amount of activated nociceptive neurons and corticosterone was seen in FIS rats, but microglial activation was more pronounced in LEW rats. Our results suggest a biphasic role of the HPA axis in pain behavior and spinal cell activation associated with ongoing inflammation. In the acute stage, the stronger reaction in FIS rats might be explained by an activating effect of corticosteroids on neutrophil function. Under ongoing inflammatory conditions the immunosuppressive actions of corticosteroids may dominate and lead to a quicker recovery of paw volume and pain sensitivity in FIS rats.', 24061072: StringElement('The general belief that orthostatic hypotension (OH) predisposes to cardiovascular events is based on sparse and contradictory data, rarely derived from population studies.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'BACKGROUND', u'Label': u'BACKGROUND'}), 11084945: 'A number of hormonal abnormalities are present in RA patients. A major theme of these abnormalities seems to be that deficiencies in the production or action of gonadal (estrogens and androgens) and adrenal (corticosteroids and DHEA) hormones may be involved in regulating the onset, severity, and progression of RA. Differences in RA incidence and activity in the pregnant and postpartum periods provide the strongest support for this view. Hormonal changes during these periods clearly have the potential to exert profound effects on RA incidence and activity. The effect of pregnancy on RA activity is actually greater than the effect of some of the newer therapeutic agents. The striking increase in corticosteroids, estrogen, and progesterone during pregnancy may suppress RA onset or activity through the regulation of production or action of cytokines such as TNF alpha, IL-1, IL-6, IL-12, and IL-10. The relative adrenal- and gonadal-deficient environment of the postpartum period further supports the view that hormonal deficiencies predispose to the development or increased activity of RA. These observations justify the search for hormonal abnormalities in RA patients outside the pregnancy and postpartum periods. In particular, further studies on the period before the onset of disease are needed. Additional evidence does exist that a functional abnormality in the adrenal glands in RA patients results in dysregulation of corticosteroid and DHEA production. These abnormalities seem to be linked to aging and disease activity. It is still not established whether these abnormalities are primary or secondary, although data indicating adrenal hypofunction before the development of RA or within the first year of disease activity suggest a primary abnormality. Several hormonal abnormalities seem to be restricted by gender and age, particularly around perimenopause and menopause. These age- and gender-influenced effects may be the cause of some of the contradictory data reviewed here. Studies in the future should make greater efforts to segregate study populations by age, gender, and reproductive status. The identification of the specific hormonal abnormalities and patient populations that are at risk is important, because these factors may allow new therapeutic approaches that are less toxic than current regimens.', 26467987: 'Toxoplasmosis is the most widespread infection worldwide. It occurs within congenital contamination, organ transplant or immune system depression. Primary infection is mainly foodborne with the ingestion of raw or undercooked meat, unwashed fruit-vegetables, unhygienic water or contaminated milk.

Contradictory data are observed within risk assessment of milk consumption and toxoplasmosis occurrence. While some papers reported positive correlations between drinking milk and infection transmission to human, other studies stated nonsignificant influence of milk or milk products consumption. New debate about the detection of the parasite in the milk matrix from different hosts raised interrogations. To figure out the real contribution and the potential correlations of milkborne way in toxoplasmic infection, meta-analysis approach was investigated. Overall analysis showed heterogeneous responses and led to state that statistically dairy matrix (other than milk), Bovidae products, agricultural population and countries in Africa, Europe and Southeast Asia are not linked to milkborne toxoplasmosis.

Among the candidate genes investigated, there are those that regulate thermogenesis and, thus, can affect energy expenditure. The uncoupling proteins (UCPs) are a family of proteins that uncouple respiration leading to generation of heat and increased energy expenditure. Contradictory data indicate that allelic variants in their coding genes might be associated with obesity. In this study we evaluated the role of two allelic variants of the UCP2 gene in obesity and the association with its sub-phenotypic characteristics. To this aim, 360 morbidly obese patients [age: 45 +/- 15 yr, body mass index (BMI): 46 +/- 7 kg/m2] and 103 normal weight subjects (BMI < 24 kg/m2) were genotyped for the 45 bais-pair (bp) insertion/deletion (I/D) in the 3'-untraslated region of exon 8 of the UCP2 gene while the presence of an Ala/Val substitution at codon 55 (Ala55Val) of the same gene was studied in 104 obese and 50 lean subjects. Patients also underwent a study protocol including measurements of BMI, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), resting energy expenditure (REE), energy intake, fat mass (FM) and free fat mass (FFM), total cholesterol (TCH), high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triacylglyceroles (TG), leptin levels, basal glucose, immunoreactive insulin (IRI), glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin sensitivity and thyroid hormones. No significant association between the two polymorphisms studied and the clinical, metabolic and anthropometric parameters characteristic of the obese phenotype was found. These results, in accordance with similar findings previously obtained in other ethnic groups, suggest that these two UCP2 allelic variants may not have a direct role in the pathogenesis and development of obesity.\", 12787360: 'The var multicopy gene family encodes Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) variant antigens, which, through their ability to adhere to a variety of host receptors, are thought to be important virulence factors. The predominant expression of a single cytoadherent PfEMP1 type on an infected red blood cell, and the switching between different PfEMP1 types to evade host protective antibody responses, are processes thought to be controlled at the transcriptional level. Contradictory data have been published on the timing of var gene transcription. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) data suggested that transcription of the predominant var gene occurs in the later (pigmented trophozoite) stages, whereas Northern blot data indicated such transcripts only in early (ring) stages. We investigated this discrepancy by Northern blot, with probes covering a diverse var gene repertoire. We confirm that almost all var transcript types were detected only in ring stages. However, one type, the well-conserved varCSA transcript, was present constitutively in different laboratory parasites and does not appear to undergo antigenic variation. Although varCSA has been shown to encode a chondroitin sulphate A (CSA)-binding PfEMP1, we find that the presence of full-length varCSA transcripts does not correlate with the CSA-binding phenotype.', 19474715: StringElement('This review presents some difficulties encountered to develop and translate immunonutrition into clinical practice, and suggests moving forward to a pharmaconutrition approach.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'OBJECTIVE', u'Label': u'PURPOSE OF REVIEW'}), 22402212: StringElement('Phthalic acid esters are widely used in the manufacture of plastics.

The exact functions of MeCP2 protein is still far from clear. At a molecular level, there exist contradictory data. MeCP2 protein is considered a single immunoreactive band around 75 kDa by western-blot analysis but several reports have revealed the existence of multiple MeCP2 immunoreactive bands above and below the level where MeCP2 is expected. MeCP2 immunoreactive bands have been interpreted in different ways. Some researchers suggest that multiple MeCP2 immunoreactive bands are unidentified proteins that cross-react with the MeCP2 antibody or degradation product of MeCP2, while others suggest that MeCP2 post-transcriptional processing generates multiple molecular forms linked to cell signaling, but so far they have not been properly analyzed in relation to Rett syndrome experimental models. The purpose of this study is to advance understanding of multiple MeCP2 immunoreactive bands in control neural cells and p.T158M MeCP2e1 mutant cells. We have generated stable wild-type and p.T158M MeCP2e1-RFP mutant expressing cells. Application of N- and C- terminal MeCP2 antibodies, and also, RFP antibody minimized concerns about nonspecific cross-reactivity, since they react with the same antigen at different epitopes. We report the existence of multiple MeCP2 immunoreactive bands in control cells, stable wild-type and p.T158M MeCP2e1-RFP mutant expressing cells. Also, MeCP2 immunoreactive bands differences were found between wild-type and p.T158M MeCP2e1-RFP mutant expressing cells. Slower migration phosphorylated band around 70kDa disappeared in p.T158M MeCP2e1-RFP mutant expressing cells. These data suggest that threonine 158 could represent an important phosphorylation site potentially involved in protein function. Our results clearly indicate that MeCP2 antibodies have no cross-reactivity with similar epitopes on others proteins, supporting the idea that MeCP2 may exist in multiple different molecular forms and that molecular pattern variations derived from altered post-transcriptional processing may underlay Rett syndrome physiophatology.', 10973354: 'Contradictory data concerning the use of non-ionic contrast media during percutaneous coronary angioplasty (PTCA) have been published. Many clinical studies have suggested that a higher rate of PTCA complications (using balloon angioplasty) was observed using non-ionic versus ionic contrast media. In order to verify these results in the era of coronary stenting, we compared the in-hospital outcome of 384 patients (pts) dilated using ionic contrast media (ioxaglate) and 387 pts dilated with non ionic contrast media (iopamidol). From October 15th 1993 to July 15th 1994, 773 consecutive pts were included in this study. At the beginning of the procedure, the pts received a first bolus of heparin (7500 IU for pts who had not been pretreated with heparin and 5000 IU for pts already treated with heparin). After the first bolus the activated clotting time (ACT) was measured and the pts received an additional bolus of 2500 IU when the ACT was below 300 sec. When the procedure exceeded one hour an additional bolus of 5000 IU was injected. The main characteristics of the 2 groups (Ioxaglate vs Iopamidol) were comparable (demographic data, indication of PTCA, procedural data, first dose of heparin, total dose of heparin). The final ACT was higher in the ioxaglate group (634 +/- 111 vs. 474 +/- 310, p < 0.001). During the hospital course, blood transfusion or vascular surgery was necessary in 1.6 vs. 1.0% (NS), acute closure occurred in 2.1 vs. 4.9% (p = 0.03), acute Q-wave myocardial infarction in 0.5 vs. 0.75% (p = NS), emergency bypass surgery in 0 vs. 0.5% (NS), death in 0.8 vs. 0.3% (NS) and major cardiac event (death, myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass surgery) in 0.8 vs. 1.6% (NS).

Diaphragmatic vagesection does not alter their occurrence or periodicity, but cervical vagal cooling inhibits both gastric cyclic motor activity and duodenal phase II activity. We have clarified this contradictory data by reversible vagal cooling at the diaphragm level in 5 dogs implanted with strain gages and bipolar electrodes to record gastric and small intestinal cyclic activities. Circulation of coolant through an implanted convectional jacket surrounding the vagal trunks lowered jacket temperature to 2 degrees-8 degrees C and maintained this temperature for 3-5 h in each experiment. Vagal denervation during cooling was proven at the end of each trial by abolition of intravenous insulin-stimulated gastric contractions, which promptly appeared with warming. More than 90% of gastric motor cycles persisted during vagal cooling. The mean duration of gastric phase III activity was reduced during cooling but the mean period of gastric motor cycles was unchanged. Duodenal phase II and III activities were unchanged and migrated normally through the small bowel. We conclude that the vagus nerve may modulate the duration of gastric phase III activity but does not govern the initiation of gastric cyclic motor activity or the duration, period, and migration of small intestinal migrating myoelectric complexes. These findings concur with those after truncal vagectomy but are different from observations made with cervical vagal cooling.', 14656285: 'Over the past two decades, the development of treatment policies and practice standards has become formalized. In ovarian cancer, most attention has been focused on the development of policies for front-line systemic treatment, using survival as the major outcome that should drive change.

Furthermore, recently completed or ongoing randomized studies of the addition of a third cytotoxic agent to paclitaxel-carboplatin are summarized. Finally, some novel noncytotoxic approaches are discussed.

SPG was a macrophage stimulant which was not mitogenic to lymphocytes. That made a sharp contrast with the data that Corynebacterium parvum, BCG, and muramyl dipeptide (MDF) were macrophage stimulants which had lymphocyte-activating properties. Treatment of SPG-treated PEC with Thy12 monoclonal antibody and guinea pig complement did not affect the capabilities of tumor-cell-growth suppression by the treated PEC. Thus, the effector cells were peritoneal adherent cells (macrophages morphologically) and effector-to-target contact seemed to be necessary for effective tumor-cell-growth inhibition, although contradictory data exist for this. Murine peritoneal adherent cells harvested 4 days after a single IP injection of SPG at a dose of 100 mg/kg body weight of mouse showed the most prominent cytostatic and cytotoxic activities against syngeneic and allogeneic tumor cells. The distribution of anti-tumor activity in macrophages of various sizes followed the same pattern as macrophages treated with C. Parvum, i.e., larger macrophages showed more remarkable anti-tumor activity. Crude nonadherent peritoneal cells incubated with SPG at a concentration of 10 micrograms/ml, 100 micrograms/ml, or 1 mg/ml did not secrete lymphokine that rendered macrophages cytotoxic, while ConA-treated nonadherent cells did so. Furthermore, spleen cells treated with SPG in vivo did not secrete macrophage-activating lymphokine in the presence of SPG. On the other hand, addition of 1 mg/ml of SPG-treated peritoneal adherent cells and bone-marrow-derived macrophages in vitro rendered them cytotoxic to a moderate degree. This implies that SPG may activate macrophages directly, allowing them to become cytotoxic in the peritoneal cavity. Lastly, SPG could induce production of II-1-like factor to a moderate degree. SPG, whose molecular structure is well elucidated, will provide us with a strong tool to analyze the mechanism of macrophage activation both in vitro and in vivo.', 24727734: u'Along with the increasing need for living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT), the issue of organ shortage has become a serious problem. Therefore, the use of organs from elderly donors has been increasing. While the short-term results of LDLT have greatly improved, problems affecting the long-term outcome of transplant patients remain unsolved. Furthermore, since contradictory data have been reported with regard to the relationship between donor age and LT/LDLT outcome, the question of whether the use of elderly donors influences the long-term outcome of a graft after LT/LDLT remains unsettled. To address whether hepatocyte telomere length reflects the outcome of LDLT, we analyzed the telomere lengths of hepatocytes in informative biopsy samples from 12 paired donors and recipients (grafts) of pediatric LDLT more than 5 years after adult-to-child LDLT because of primary biliary atresia, using quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (Q-FISH). The telomere lengths in the paired samples showed a robust relationship between the donor and grafted hepatocytes (r\\u200a=\\u200a0.765, p\\u200a=\\u200a0.0038), demonstrating the feasibility of our Q-FISH method for cell-specific evaluation. While 8 pairs showed no significant difference between the telomere lengths for the donor and the recipient, the other 4 pairs showed significantly shorter telomeres in the recipient than in the donor. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the donors in the latter group were older than those in the former (p\\u200a=\\u200a0.001). Despite the small number of subjects, this pilot study indicates that donor age is a crucial factor affecting telomere length sustainability in hepatocytes after pediatric LDLT, and that the telomeres in grafted livers may be elongated somewhat longer when the grafts are immunologically well controlled.', 16541129: 'The very different effects of Cholera Toxin (CT) on cell growth and proliferation may depend on the type of ganglioside receptors in cell membranes and different signal transduction mechanisms triggered, but other functions related to the drug resistance mechanisms can not be excluded. The effect of CT treatment on the \"in vitro\" clonogenicity, the Population Doubling Time (PDT), apoptosis, PKA activation and Bax and Bcl-2 expression was evaluated in WEHI-3B cell line and its CT-resistant subclone (WEHI-3B/CTRES). In WEHI-3B parental cells the dramatic accumulation of cAMP induced by CT correlated well with PKA activation, increased PDT value, inhibition of clonogenicity and apoptosis. H-89 treatment inhibited PKA activation by CT but did not protect the cells from apoptosis and growth inhibition. In WEHI-3B/CTRES no significant CT-dependent accumulation of cAMP occurred with any increase of PKA activity and PDT. In CT resistant cells (WEHI-3B/CTRES), Bcl-2 expression was down regulated by both CT or drug treatment (eg., ciprofloxacin, CPX) although these cells were protected from CT-dependent apoptosis but not from drug-induced apoptosis. Differently from other cell models described, down regulation of Bcl-2 is proved to be independent on cAMP accumulation and PKA activation. Our observations support the implication of cAMP dependent kinase (PKA) in the inhibition of WEHI-3B cells growth and suggest that, in WEHI-3B/CTRES, Bcl-2 expression could be modulated by CT in the absence of cAMP accumulation. Also in consideration of many contradictory data reported in literature, our cell models (of one sensitive parental cell strain and two clones with different uncrossed specific resistance to CT and CPX) provides a new and interesting tool for better investigating the relationship between the CT signal transduction mechanisms and Bcl-2 expression and function.', 15326395: 'Etoposide, a topoisomerase II poison is used in the treatment of a number of solid tumors. Contradictory data exist on the role of the telomere/telomerase complex in etoposide induced apoptosis. Therefore we examined the effects of etoposide treatment in the neuroblastoma cell line SHSY5Y, with very short telomeres and the acute lymphoblastic T cell line 1301, which displays extremely long telomeres. Both short-term and continuous exposure to the drug were examined. Etoposide induced widespread DNA damage followed by DNA damage foci formation and ultimately growth arrest and apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. However, length of telomeres and of single stranded telomeric G rich overhangs did not change significantly under the treatments in any cell line. There was no significant induction of single-strand breaks in the G-rich strand of telomeres. Telomerase activity was transiently upregulated under low concentrations of etoposide, while high concentrations resulted in decreased telomerase activity only after onset of apoptosis. Telomerase overexpression protected against etoposide induced apoptosis in fibroblasts. The data suggest that telomeres are not major signal transducers towards growth arrest or apoptosis after etoposide treatment. However, upregulation of telomerase might be part of an attempted adaptative response, which protects cells by a mechanism that might be independent of telomere length maintenance.', 3291836: \"Clinical trials first began in 1960 with methylprednisolone acetate (Depo-Medrol) administered intrathecally, in an attempt to treat both disk disease and multiple sclerosis. After a few reports of salubrious results, there began an outpouring of contradictory data, which continues in 1988. During this time span, researchers who cautiously tested the different theses of improvement began to publish serious warnings of many complications. For ten years prior to the intraspinal use of methylprednisolone acetate, basic scientists in anesthesiology and neurochemistry had published the following facts: (1) Methylprednisolone acetate's content of polyethylene glycol raises the risks of using it near the central nervous system. (2) Deleterious effects follow the use of glycols when they are placed into or near the neuraxis. (3) Methylprednisolone acetate contains approximately 30 mg of polyethylene glycol per milliliter. (4) When that glycol, which is both alcohol and detergent, is injected intraspinally, sterile meningitis, arachnoiditis, or pachymeningitis will occur. It has also been recognized since the 1960s that the epidural space is not wholly separate from the subdural and/or subarachnoid space. Many thousands of arachnoid villi subtend all the membranes from the intrathecal space, and many of these end in the large epidural veins. Therefore, the various spaces and membranes are not only contiguous, but continuous. It follows that an injection of methylprednisolone acetate into the epidural space does not guarantee that it will remain isolated there. Finally, the inadvertency of injections by the epidural route occurs with the following frequency: 40% of injections can be inadvertently made into interspinous ligaments, and 2.5% into the subarachnoid space.\", 9111231: \"Lipocortin 1 (LC1, annexin 1) has received considerable attention as a substrate for protein kinases, as a Ca++- and phosphatidylserine-binding protein, and as a mediator of glucocorticoid anti-inflammatory effects.

However, there are still contradictory data for particular strains and it is also uncertain which changes might predict senescence changes later in life, including the force of mortality. In the present paper we use telemetry to study LMA and CR of BT during aging of BALB/c mice. At our knowledge this is the first time that CR of BT and LMA are investigated in this strain in a range of age covering the whole lifespan, from young adult up to very old age. CR of BT was analyzed with a cosine model using a cross sectional approach and follow-up measurements. The results show that BT, LMA, amplitude, goodness-of-fit (GoF) to circadian cycle of temperature decrease with different shapes during chronological age. Moreover, we found that the % change of amplitude and BT in early life (5-19\\xa0months) can predict the remaining lifespan of the mice. Later in life (22-32\\xa0months), best predictors are single measurements of LMA and GoF.

The highly cytopathic HIV-1 246 and NDK strains were able to infect CEM cells and undergo several cycles of replication at saturating doses of LEU3-A, OKT4-A, and 13B8-2 monoclonal antibodies, whereas propagation of reference HIV-1 BRU and weakly cytopathic strain HIV-1 PAS was inhibited. Postadsorption treatment by anti-CD4 antibodies had stronger inhibitory effect than did treatment during the virus adsorption period. In parallel experiments, the same monoclonal antibodies successfully blocked syncytium formation between uninfected MT4 cells and CEM cells infected by all four HIV-1 virus strains tested. To explain these seemingly contradictory data we have postulated that anti-CD4 antibodies efficiently inhibit cell-to-cell but not virus-to-cell infection.', 12097239: 'Most cast dental restorations are made from alloys or commercially pure titanium (cpTi). Many orthodontic appliances are also fabricated from metallic materials. It has been documented in vitro and in vivo that metallic dental devices release metal ions, mainly due to corrosion. Those metallic components may be locally and systemically distributed and could play a role in the etiology of oral and systemic pathological conditions. The quality and quantity of the released cations depend upon the type of alloy and various corrosion parameters. No general correlation has been observed between alloy nobility and corrosion. However, it has been documented that some Ni-based alloys, such as beryllium-containing Ni alloys, exhibit increased corrosion, specifically at low pH. Further, microparticles are abraded from metallic restorations due to wear. In sufficient quantities, released metal ions-particularly Cu, Ni, Be, and abraded microparticles-can also induce inflammation of the adjacent periodontal tissues and the oral mucosa. While there is also some in vitro evidence that the immune response can be altered by various metal ions, the role of these ions in oral inflammatory diseases such as gingivitis and periodontitis is unknown. Allergic reactions due to metallic dental restorations have been documented. Ni has especially been identified as being highly allergenic. Interestingly, from 34% to 65.5% of the patients who are allergic to Ni are also allergic to Pd. Further, Pd allergy always occurrs with Ni sensitivity. In contrast, no study has been published which supports the hypothesis that dental metallic materials are mutagenic/genotoxic or might be a carcinogenic hazard to man. Taken together, very contradictory data have been documented regarding the local and systemic effects of dental casting alloys and metallic ions released from them. Therefore, it is of critical importance to elucidate the release of cations from metallic dental restorations in the oral environment and to determine the biological interactions of released metal components with oral and systemic tissues.', 11213016: 'The anticancer drugs vincristine sulphate (VCR) and cyclophosphamide (CTX) were tested for their cytogenetic effects in the bone marrow cells of Swiss mice. The end points investigated were chromosomal aberrations and mitotic index at 24 hours posttreatment and micronuclei (MN) at 30 hours posttreatment in bone marrow cells of male and female mice after a single intraperitoneal exposure. The doses tested were VCR 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/kg and CTX 40 mg/kg b.w. of mice. Significant percentages of chromosomal aberrations and significant numbers of micronuclei per thousand polychromatic erythrocytes (PCEs) that were induced were recorded from bone marrow of each of the VCR-treated groups of mice. There were no significant differences between the percentages of dividing cells in the VCR-treated group and the vehicle control groups of mice. Peculiarly, in the chromosomal aberration study, the male mice were found to be more responsive to VCR than the females, and the aberrations per hundred metaphases were found to be decreased when the dose of VCR was increased. The percentage of dividing cells was also higher with the lowest dose of VCR tested. However, there was a dose-dependent, but nonlinear, increase in MN per thousand PCEs. The results were compared with the already available fragmentary and self-contradictory data on the genotoxicity of VCR in mice and in other mammalian test systems.', 2406107: 'For patients with previous endometrial cancer, ERT is not the accepted practice in the U.S. The therapeutic dictum that estrogen is contraindicated in patients with previous uterine adenocarcinoma is, however, not substantiated by clinical data. The relation of unopposed estrogen stimulation to endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma, and the published studies relating ERT to endometrial cancer, have resulted in the clinical perception--and cautionary statements to that effect--that estrogen is contraindicated for patients with a history of endometrial carcinoma. The exact biologic effects of ERT on endometrial adenocarcinoma have not yet been studied adequately, however; the initial clinical data suggest that there is no increase in recurrence or mortality. In the meantime, the clinician is left with contradictory data as a basis for determining the proper management of symptomatic patients. The total impact of estrogen deficiency on the health of women and the ratio of benefits and risks of ERT are yet to be defined completely. The preponderance of evidence suggests that estrogen has a beneficial effect on the major cause of death in women, coronary heart disease, by increasing the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) fraction of cholesterol. It is established that estrogen prevents the demineralization of bone and delays the ravages of osteoporosis. No one has died from vaginal atrophy, bladder dysfunction, or hot flashes; the quality of life and marriage have been improved, however, by relieving these symptomatic conditions with ERT. Several studies have attempted to analyze with various statistical models the ratio of benefits to risks, and the majority of authors have concluded that the beneficial effect on cardiovascular disease alone clearly outweighs any known risk.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)', 27430109: StringElement('Melanoma is the most aggresive malignant tumor of the skin.

Largely involved in obesity and associated metabolic disorders, it is now described as a reservoir of immature stromal cells. These cells, called adipose-derived stromal cells (ADSCs) must be distinguished from the crude stromal vascular fraction (SVF) obtained after digestion of adipose tissue. ADSCs share many features with mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone marrow, including paracrine activity, but they also display some specific features, including a greater angiogenic potential. Their angiogenic properties as well as their paracrine activity suggest a putative tumor-promoting role for ADSCs although contradictory data have been published on this issue. Both SVF cells and ADSCs are currently being investigated in clinical trials in several fields (chronic inflammation, ischemic diseases, etc.). Apart from a phase III trial on the treatment of fistula, most of these are in phase\\u2005I\\u2005and use autologous cells. In the near future, the end results of these trials should provide a great deal of data on the safety of ADSC use.', 8354016: 'Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors which have active moieties excreted mainly in urine require adjustment of either the dose or the interval between doses in patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction or severe congestive heart failure. Those agents such as temocapril (CS 622) and fosinopril, excreted both in urine and bile, may not require such adjustment. Renal clearance of ACE inhibitors may be reduced and some accumulation may occur in elderly patients with mild renal dysfunction or congestive heart failure. The bioavailability of ACE inhibitors is reduced by concomitant food or antacids which may slow gastric emptying and raise gastric pH. Pharmacokinetic interactions with ACE inhibitors are unlikely in patients receiving thiazide or loop diuretics. When ACE inhibitors are given hyperkalaemia may occur in patients with renal insufficiency, those taking potassium supplements or potassium-sparing diuretics, and in diabetic patients with mild renal impairment. While no pharmacokinetic interaction precludes use of this combination, the pharmacokinetics of some ACE inhibitors are subject to greater variability when patients also receive beta-blockers. Calcium antagonists and ACE inhibitors have additive anti-hypertensive effects and pharmacokinetic interactions between these agents are unlikely. One report exists of a significant effect of coadministered hydralazine on the pharmacokinetics and urinary excretion of lisinopril. Data on interactions between ACE inhibitors and digitalis are contradictory. There is no evidence that the concomitant use of ACE inhibitors and digoxin is associated with an increased risk of digitalis toxicity. ACE inhibitors are mainly excreted by glomerular filtration and renal tubular secretion. Possible interactions between ACE inhibitors and probenecid have been noted, with renal and total body clearance of ACE inhibitors being potentially reduced in the presence of probenecid. Probenecid pretreatment may enhance the pharmacodynamic response of ACE inhibitors. Few but contradictory data exist on the effects of H2-blockers on ACE inhibitor pharmacokinetics and little information is available on interactions between ACE inhibitors and hypoglycaemic drugs. Some case reports link ACE inhibitors with the induction of lithium toxicity. Coadministration of lithium should be undertaken with caution, and frequent monitoring of lithium concentrations is recommended with all ACE inhibitors. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may attenuate the haemodynamic actions of ACE inhibitors. NSAIDs reduce renal excretion of ACE inhibitors, with a corresponding increase in circulating drug concentrations. There is little information available on the pharmacokinetic interaction with ACE inhibitors and cyclosporin, but caution should be employed when they are used together.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)', 7775970: \"A form of long-term potentiation (LTP) is induced at the mossy fiber (MF) synapse in the hippocampus by high-frequency presynaptic stimulation (HFS). It is generally accepted that induction of this form of LTP (MF LTP) does not depend on postsynaptic Ca2+ current gated by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, but it has remained controversial whether induction depends on postsynaptic depolarization and voltage-gated entry of Ca2+. There are also contradictory data on the time course of both LTP and post-tetanic potentiation (PTP), a shorter duration form of potentiation observed at MF synapses immediately following HFS. It has been proposed that some of these differences in results may have arisen because of difficulties in isolating monosynaptic responses to MF input. In the present study, whole cell recording was used to observe excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) elicited in CA3 pyramidal cells by input from MFs. Postsynaptic cells were dialyzed with 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) and F- to inhibit postsynaptic mechanisms that required Ca2+, cells were under voltage clamp during HFS, and conditions were selected to minimize the likelihood of polysynaptic contamination. Under these conditions, HFS nevertheless induced robust LTP (mean magnitude, 62%). The possibility that EPSCs were contaminated by polysynaptic components was investigated by exposing the slices to a suppressing medium (one that partially blocked neurotransmission). EPSC waveforms did not change shape during suppression, indicating that contamination was absent. The LTP observed always was accompanied by prominent PTP that lasted through the first 5 to 15 min following HFS (mean decay time constant, 3.2 min). Induction of this LTP was not cooperative; there was no relationship between the size of responses and the magnitude of the LTP induced. LTP magnitude also was unrelated to the extent to which postsynaptic cells depolarized during HFS. These results show that high rates of presynaptic MF activity elicit robust LTP whether or not there is accompanying postsynaptic depolarization or increase in the concentration of postsynaptic Ca2+. High-frequency MF activity also results in a PTP that is unusually large and long.\", 24244454: 'Sildenafil citrate (Viagra), a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor (PDE5i), is a commonly prescribed drug for erectile dysfunction. Since the introduction of Viagra in 1997, several case reports have linked Viagra to sudden sensorineural hearing loss. However, these studies are not well controlled for confounding factors, such as age and noise-induced hearing loss and none of these reports are based on prospective double-blind studies. Further, animal studies report contradictory data. For example, one study (2008) reported hearing loss in rats after long-term and high-dose exposure to sildenafil citrate. The other study (2012) showed vardenafil, another formulation of PDE5i, to be protective against noise-induced hearing loss in mice and rats. Whether or not clinically relevant doses of sildenafil citrate cause hearing loss in normal subjects (animals or humans) is controversial. One possibility is that PDE5i exacerbates age-related susceptibility to hearing loss in adults. Therefore, we tested sildenafil citrate in C57BL/6J, a strain of mice that displays increased susceptibility to age-related hearing loss, and compared the results to those obtained from the FVB/N, a strain of mice with no predisposition to hearing loss. Six-week-old mice were injected with the maximum tolerated dose of sildenafil citrate (10 mg/kg/day) or saline for 30 days. Auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) were recorded pre- and post injection time points to assess hearing loss. Entry of sildenafil citrate in the mouse cochlea was confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis of a downstream target of the cGMP-PKG cascade. ABR data indicated no statistically significant difference in hearing between treated and untreated mice in both backgrounds. Results show that the maximum tolerated dose of sildenafil citrate administered daily for 4 weeks does not affect hearing in the mouse. Our study gives no indication that Viagra will negatively impact hearing and it emphasizes the need to revisit the issue of Viagra related ototoxicity in humans.', 18020588: 'Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are clonal disorders of haemopoietic stem cells which are characterised by peripheral cytopenia and, usually, by an increased bone marrow cellularity. Transfusions of red blood cells and platelets comprise the basis of supportive care for anaemia and thrombocytopenia. In patients who progress to acute myeloid leukaemia, cytotoxic chemotherapy is used. In MDS, haemopoietic growth factors can enhance: proliferation and differentiation of normal and myelodysplastic haemopoietic progenitor cells, and prevent premature apoptosisacceleration of haemopoietic recovery after intensive chemotherapy and amelioration of mature cell function; and sensitisation of malignant cells for the cytotoxic action of chemotherapeutic agents. There is widespread clinical experience with the use of epoetin (EPO), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). A meta-analysis of 17 trials with EPO showed a stimulation of erythropoiesis, resulting in a discontinuation of the need for transfusions or an increase in haemoglobin levels of at least 15 g/L in 16% of 205 patients. Favourable factors for the response were an initial absence of a need for transfusion and a serum EPO level <200 U/L. In clinical phase I/II studies of GM-CSF administration, a dose-dependent increase in the absolute neutrophil count was seen in >80% of patients, as well as a decrease in the infection rate. The effect on survival could not be assessed. Lower platelet counts, with a risk of bleeding, bone pain, local erythema at the subcutaneous injection site and phlebitis during intravenous infusion, were observed. The combined administration of GM-CSF and EPO to a small number of patients resulted in an increase in haemoglobin levels or a decrease in the need for transfusion, with an overall response rate of 46%, but is not a proven treatment. The use of G-CSF increased the absolute neutrophil count in about 90% of patients with MDS, and was accompanied by an improvement of neutrophil function, which is frequently impaired in these patients. However, contradictory data exist on the influence of prophylactic G-CSF treatment on the infection rate. Bone pain and thrombocytopenia were the most important adverse effects of G-CSF treatment. Synergism of G-CSF and EPO has not yet been proven in randomised phase III trials, although selected patients showing no response to EPO alone may achieve normal haemoglobin levels after receiving additional G-CSF. Treatment in vivo with EPO, GM-CSF or G-CSF has not been shown to change the percentage of bone marrow cells carrying cytogenetic aberrations.

GPR43 is mainly expressed in neutrophils, adipocytes and enteroendocrine cells, implicated to be involved in inflammation, obesity and type 2 diabetes. However, several groups have reported the contradictory data about the physiological functions of GPR43, so that its roles in vivo remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that a novel compound of pyrimidinecarboxamide class named as BTI-A-404 is a selective and potent competitive inverse agonist of human GPR43, but not the murine ortholog. Through structure-activity relationship (SAR), we also found active compound named as BTI-A-292. These regulators increased the cyclic AMP level and reduced acetate-induced cytoplasmic Ca(2+) level. Furthermore, we show that they modulated the downstream signaling pathways of GPR43, such as ERK, p38 MAPK, and NF-\\u03baB.

Administration of resistin lowered the glucose tolerance threshold and impaired insulin activity; whereas anti-resistin antibodies had the opposite effects. However, contradictory data were subsequently reported in regard to the correlation between resistin expression level and obesity or type 2 diabetes. Two additional proteins that share a highly homologous C-terminus with resistin have been identified in mouse, and one in human, forming a resistin-related protein family. Resistin was shown to dimerize through a disulfide bond formed by the N-terminal-most cysteine (Cys26). Here we demonstrate that while Cys26 is both necessary and sufficient for homodimer formation, all three resistin family members can also interact with one another regardless of the presence of Cys26 through non-covalent interactions. Furthermore, protein crosslinking analysis indicated that resistin and resistin beta, but not resistin alpha, exist as multimers, probably with a dimer as the subunit. The multiple protein complex formation is obviously at a level higher than the Cys26 disulfide bonding. These results suggest the potential importance of considering intermolecular interactions among resistin family members in studying their functions.', 8695544: StringElement(\"There have been many trials investigating the influence of chemotherapy on survival following surgery or radiotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer.

It allows the measurement of new parameters of splenic function, such as the intrasplenic platelet transit time, which has shed new light on the physiology of splenic blood cell handling. 2. It facilitates the measurement of platelet life span in conditions, such as ITP, in which 51Cr may undergo undesirable elution from the platelet as a result of platelet-antibody interaction. 3. It allows the determination of the fate of platelets, that is, the site of platelet destruction in conditions in which reduced platelet life span is associated with abnormal platelet consumption, as a result of either premature destruction of \"abnormal\" platelets by the RE system, or the consumption (or destruction) of normal platelets after their interaction with an abnormal vasculature. Future research using 111In platelets may yield further valuable information on the control as well as the significance of intrasplenic platelet pooling, on the role of platelets in the development of chronic vascular lesions, and on the sites of platelet destruction in ITP. With regard to the latter, methods will have to be developed for harvesting sufficient platelets representative of the total circulating platelet population from severely thrombocytopenic patients for autologous platelet labeling. This would avoid the use of homologous platelets, which is likely to be responsible for some of the contradictory data relating to the use of radiolabeled platelet studies for the prediction of the response of patients with ITP to splenectomy.', 15368955: 'Chemically, isoflavones belong to the group of polyphenols. The most important food source is soy, which contains mainly genistein and daidzein in the form of glycosides. The absorption rate ranges from 20-55%. Isoflavones are selectively incorporated in certain tissues like the breast and ovaries. They are able to bind to the estrogen receptors alpha (ER-alpha) and beta (ER-beta). However, the binding affinity for genistein to ER-alpha is only 4%, the affinity to ER-beta is 87% compared to 17beta-estradiol. Thus, depending on the estradiol concentration, they exhibit weak estrogenic or antiestrogenic activity. Isoflavones can influence transcription and cell proliferation. They modulate enzyme activities as well as signal transduction, and have antioxidant properties. Epidemiological studies have shown that the prevalence of hot flashes is lower in women from countries with high dietary isoflavone intake such as Japan than in Western nations with low isoflavone intake. Results of clinical studies on the effects of soy products or isolated isoflavones on vasomotor symptoms are contradictory. Due to a strong placebo effect and a time-dependent reduction of hot flashes, phytoestrogens were seen to have no significant effect in most studies. The use of soy isoflavones could, however, be considered for women with intense disorders. Because of contradictory data from in vitro and animal studies, a definite safety assessment of isoflavone intake cannot be made to date.

Contradictory data have been published concerning the effect of diphenyleneiodonium on the production of reactive oxygen species in cells, both inhibitory and stimulatory action of DPI being reported. We have examined the effect of DPI on the cellular production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) and on the proliferation and apoptosis of human vascular endothelial cells. We found increased oxidation of ROS-sensitive probes (dihydrorhodamine 123 and 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate) when DPI (20 microM-100 microM) was present in the treated cells. However, oxidation of the fluorogenic probes was inhibited if DPI (20 microM-100 microM) was removed from the reaction medium after cell preincubation. These results suggest an artifactual oxidation of the fluorogenic probes by DPI or its metabolites. A similar pattern of influence of DPI on the production of NO (measured with 4-amino-5-methylamino-2',7'-difluorofluorescein diacetate) was observed. Modulation of generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in DPI-treated cells influenced the nitration of tyrosine residues of cellular proteins, estimated by Western blotting. Decreased level of nitration generally paralleled the lowered production of ROS.

This represents a novel factor in American health care delivery driven by the reality that the United States spends more than any other nation on health care yet still lags behind in key outcome measures. Patient satisfaction has been established as a core component of physician rankings and reimbursement. In fact, it already has acted as both a powerful motivator and stressor. Patient feedback has driven hospital administrators' agendas to improve facilities and provide relative luxuries to inpatients, and individual providers have been tempted to ignore sound medical judgment by relenting to patient requests to increase their satisfaction scores. Unfortunately, there is little high-level evidence to support that patient satisfaction will improve medical outcomes, and there are plenty of contradictory data in smaller studies. Part of the difficulty of these studies may lie in the diversity of patient expectations, which are dependent on the disease process and the inherently subjective and labile nature of people's responses.

E. magnusii yeast was used in the study as it is the only yeast strain possessing a natural high-capacity \\u0421\\u0430\\xb2\\u207a transport system. The key reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxifying enzymes in the yeast cells--catalases (CATs) and superoxide dismutases (SODs)--were fully characterized. At least five isoforms of SODs and only one isoform of CATs were found in the E. magnusii mitochondria. The assessment of the main properties of mitochondrial non-specific permeability under physiological conditions such as dynamics of the membrane potential (\\u2206\\u03a8) and swelling in mitochondria showed that under physiological conditions classical inhibitors of CATs (ATZ--3-amino-1, 2, 4-triazole) and of SODs (DDC--diethyldithiocarbamate) caused irreversible decline in \\u2206\\u03a8 in the yeast mitochondria. This decline was accelerated in the presence of 500 \\u03bcM \\u0421\\u0430\\xb2\\u207a. The combined action of the inhibitors (ATZ + DDC) promoted moderate swelling in the isotonic medium, which was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Mitochondrial swelling in the cells exposed to antioxidant system inhibitors was accompanied by typical signs of early apoptosis, namely by chromatin margination and condensation, vacuolization of the cytosol, and damage of the plasma membrane. Here we showed, at both cellular and mitochondrial levels, that the deregulation of oxidant-scavenging enzymes directly leads to the opening of the mPTP, followed by induction of apoptotic markers in the whole yeast cells. Our studies are the first to clarify the highly contradictory data in the literature on mPTP in yeast mitochondria.', 16020753: 'Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) seem to be a promising tool for cell therapy of acute myocardial infarction, but their nature is still unclear. We show here that EPCs obtainable from peripheral blood (PB) derive from the adhesion-related selection in culture of a subset of CD14+ cells, which, when assessed by the highly-sensitive antibody-conjugated magnetofluorescent liposomes (ACMFL) technique, were found to express CD34. These CD14+CD34low cells represented a variable proportion at individual level of CD14+ cells, ranging from 0.6% to 8.5% of all peripheral-blood leukocytes, and constituted the dominant population among circulating KDR+ cells. By using the ACMFL technique, virtually all CD14+ cells present in the bone marrow were found to be CD14+CD34low double-positive cells. EPCs, as well as purified circulating CD14+CD34low cells, exhibited high expression of embryonic stem cell (SC) markers Nanog and Oct-4, which were downregulated in a STAT3-independent manner when they differentiated into endothelial cells (ECs). Moreover, circulating CD14+CD34low cells, but not CD14+CD34- cells, proliferated in response to SC growth factors, and exhibited clonogenicity and multipotency, as shown by their ability to differentiate not only into ECs, but also into osteoblasts, adipocytes, or neural cells. The results of this study may reconcile apparently contradictory data of the literature, showing the generation of PB-derived EPCs from either CD34+ or CD14+ cells. We suggest that the use of this previously unrecognized population of circulating CD14+CD34low cells, which exhibit both phenotypic and functional features of SCs, may be useful in improving cell-based therapies of vascular and tissue damage.', 12485908: 'HIF-1 (hypoxia-inducible factor-1) is the major transcription factor that is specifically activated during hypoxia. This transcription factor is composed of two subunits: HIF-1alpha and ARNT (aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator). ARNT is constitutively expressed, whereas HIF-1alpha is targeted to proteasome degradation by ubiquitination during normoxia. In hypoxia, HIF-1alpha is stabilized and translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to ARNT. The active HIF-1 induces expression of various genes whose products play an adaptive role to the new conditions induced by hypoxia. Besides the role played by HIF-1 in the adaptation to hypoxia, recent data describe a possible role for HIF-1 in the modulation of apoptosis. According to some authors, hypoxia induces apoptosis. However, it has also been reported that hypoxia could protect cells against apoptotic cell death induced by various agents such as serum deprivation and incubation in the presence of chemotherapy agents. These contradictory data suggest that HIF-1 could display either a proapoptotic or an antiapoptotic role according to the conditions. In order to study how HIF-1 can modulate apoptosis, we studied whether hypoxia or cobalt chloride, a chemical inducer of HIF-1, could influence apoptosis induced by tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP), serum deprivation, or both in hepatoma cell line HepG2. HepG2 cells were incubated 8 hours under normoxia or hypoxia in the presence of t-BHP with or without CoCl2. CoCl2 reduced the apoptotic death of HepG2 cells induced by t-BHP and serum deprivation, as measured by DNA fragmentation. This effect was confirmed by measurement of the caspase activity. Moreover, hypoxia also prevented t-BHP- or serum deprivation-induced DNA fragmentation and caspase activation-however, to a lower extent than CoCl2. These different data suggest a possible antiapoptotic role of HIF-1. More experiments are needed to define if HIF-1 actually plays an active role in cell death protection and to determine the exact mechanism underlying this effect.', 24905496: 'It is essential to understand the role of cardiolipin (CL) in mitochondrial membrane organization given that changes in CL levels contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction in type II diabetes, ischemia-reperfusion injury, heart failure, breast cancer, and aging. Specifically, there are contradictory data on how CL influences the molecular packing of membrane phospholipids. Therefore, we determined how increasing levels of heart CL impacted molecular packing in large unilamellar vesicles, modeling heterogeneous lipid mixtures found within the mitochondrial inner membrane, using merocyanine (MC540) fluorescence. We broadly categorized lipid vesicles of equal mass as loosely packed, intermediate, and highly packed based on peak MC540 fluorescence intensity. CL had opposite effects on loosely versus highly packed vesicles. Exposure of loosely packed vesicles to increasing levels of CL dose-dependently increased membrane packing. In contrast, increasing amounts of CL in highly packed vesicles decreased the packing in a dose-dependent manner. In vesicles that were categorized as intermediate packing, CL had either no effect or decreased packing at select doses in a dose-independent manner. Altogether, the results aid in resolving some of the discrepant data by demonstrating that CL displays differential effects on membrane packing depending on the composition of the lipid environment. This has implications for mitochondrial protein activity in response to changing CL levels in microdomains of varying composition.', 11812635: 'Minocycline, a broad-spectrum antibiotic used in the treatment of acne and periodontal disease and to control inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, has recently been shown to induce a spectrum of adverse health effects. In the light of these contradictory data, this research was directed to provide basic information on the toxicology of minocycline, using in vitro cell culture models, and to evaluate its efficacy in periodontal therapies, particularly for wound healing. The human gingival epithelioid S-G cell line was used as the bioindicator. The greater toxicity of minocycline over doxycycline and tetracycline, related antimicrobial agents, probably correlated with its higher lipophilicity. The cytotoxicity of minocycline was unaffected by an S9 hepatic microsomal fraction, indicating that it is a direct-acting, rather than a metabolism-mediated, cytotoxicant. In comparative toxicity studies, much variation in the degree of sensitivity to minocycline was noted for different cell types. No correlation in the extent of sensitivity to minocycline and the physiologic state of the bioindicator cell (normal, transformed or malignant) was noted. The toxicity of minocycline to the S-G cells was dependent on its concentration and length of exposure. For a continuous 3-day exposure of the S-G cells to minocycline, the midpoint cytotoxicity (or, NR(50)) value, as quantified in the neutral red (NR) assay, was 204 microg/ml on day 1, 84 microg/ml on day 2, and 59 microg/ml on day 3. For a 1-h exposure of the S-G cells in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), the NR(50) value was 780 microg/ml minocycline. Although a 1-h exposure in PBS to 200 microg/ml minocycline exerted some toxicity, the S-G cells recovered on exposure to growth medium; irreversible, progressive damage occurred at 400 microg/ml minocycline and greater. Minocycline, at 50 microg/ml, enhanced attachment of the S-G cells to a gelatin-coated surface and cell migration towards an immobilized fibronectin gradient, both biologic parameters important in periodontal wound healing. Minocycline generally had little or no effect on production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8), by non-activated S-G cells, the exception being stimulation of IL-6 at 48 h. IL-1beta, however, greatly stimulated IL-6 and IL-8 production, which was further increased by concurrent exposure to minocycline. This suggested that minocycline may enhance the ability of gingival epithelial cells to participate in the early, inflammatory phase of periodontal wound healing. The limitation of minocycline efficacy to a rather narrow window of concentration, centering about 50 microg/ml, and primarily for short-term exposures may possibly explain, in part, the contradictory clinical data on the health effects of this drug.', 6994717: 'The crystals of the entomocidal protein of Bacillus thuringiensis are admixed with proteinases that in the course of their dissolution cause gradual degradation of the \"genuine\" crystal-forming protein components (i.e. the primary biosynthetic products) to products of lower molecular weight. This phenomenon might explain at least partially the contradictory data on the molecular parameters of the crystal-forming proteins. Preliminary inactivation of the proteinases adsorbed on the crystals allowed us to eliminate this source of the artefacts and to gain more reliable data on the protein composition of the crystals formed by various strains of B. thuringiensis. It has been shown that the crystals formed by all serotypes of B. thuringiensis, with the exception of the serotype V, contain only one protein with a mol. wt. of 145000, 135000 or 130000, depending on the strain.

Acknowledging that the A. fumigatus cell wall contains a high beta-1,3-glucan content, we questioned whether the beta-glucan receptor dectin-1 played a role in this recognition process. Monoclonal antibody, soluble receptor, and competitive carbohydrate blockage indicated that the alveolar macrophage inflammatory response, specifically the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha), IL-1beta, IL-6, CXCL2/macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2), CCL3/macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), and granulocyte monocyte-CSF (GM-CSF), to live A. fumigatus was dependent on recognition via the beta-glucan receptor dectin-1. The inflammatory response was triggered at the highest level by A. fumigatus swollen conidia and early germlings and correlated to the levels of surface-exposed beta glucans, indicating that dectin-1 preferentially recognizes specific morphological forms of A. fumigatus. Intratracheal administration of A. fumigatus conidia to mice in the presence of a soluble dectin-Fc fusion protein reduced both lung proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine levels and cellular recruitment while modestly increasing the A. fumigatus fungal burden, illustrating the importance of beta-glucan-initiated dectin-1 signaling in defense against this pathogen. Collectively, these data show that dectin-1 is centrally required for the generation of alveolar macrophage proinflammatory responses to A. fumigatus and to our knowledge provides the first in vivo evidence for the role of dectin-1 in fungal innate defense.', 28754721: StringElement('Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) is an exceedingly rare and orphan disease, without active drugs approved in the front line.

How to reconcile these apparently contradictory data properties has been a severe challenge to previous models, and none has explained them all. The present article quantitatively simulates them all by further developing the FACADE vision model. Key model processes discount the illuminant and compute image contrasts in each monocular channel using shunting on-center off-surround networks; binocularly fuse these discounted monocular signals using shunting on-center off-surround networks with nonlinear excitatory and inhibitory signals; and use these binocularly fused activities to trigger filling-in of a binocular surface representation that represents perceived surface brightness.

In an attempt to reconcile contradictory data reported on oocyst morphometrics and biological descriptions of various Eimeria species infecting turkey, we established single oocyst derived lines of 5 important Eimeria species infecting turkeys, Eimeria meleagrimitis (USMN08-01 strain), Eimeria adenoeides (Guelph strain), Eimeria gallopavonis (Weybridge strain), Eimeria meleagridis (USAR97-01 strain), and Eimeria dispersa (Briston strain). Short portions (514 bp) of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (mt COI) from each were amplified and sequenced. Comparison of these sequences showed sufficient species-specific sequence variation to recommend these short mt COI sequences as species-specific markers. Uniformity of oocyst features (dimensions and oocyst structure) of each pure line was observed. Additional morphological features of the oocysts of these species are described as useful for the microscopic differentiation of these Eimeria species. Combined molecular and morphometric data on these single species lines compared with the original species descriptions and more recent data have helped to clarify some confusing, and sometimes conflicting, features associated with these Eimeria spp. For example, these new data suggest that the KCH and KR strains of E. adenoeides reported previously represent 2 distinct species, E. adenoeides and E. meleagridis, respectively. Likewise, analysis of the Weybridge strain of E. adenoeides, which has long been used as a reference strain in various studies conducted on the pathogenicity of E. adenoeides, indicates that this coccidium is actually a strain of E. gallopavonis. We highly recommend mt COI sequence-based genotyping be incorporated into all studies using Eimeria spp. of turkeys to confirm species identifications and so that any resulting data can be associated correctly with a single named Eimeria species.', 8620336: 'Autoantibodies to oxidized LDL have been reported in normal subjects and in patients with arteriosclerosis, but their possible pathogenic role is not yet well defined. One important problem is the existence of contradictory data reported by different groups concerning the associations between antioxidized LDL autoantibodies and the presence or progression of arteriosclerotic lesions. Such contradictions led us to decide to isolate and characterize antioxidized LDL antibodies by affinity chromatography with the use of oxidized LDL cross-linked to Sepharose. Antioxidized LDL antibodies were isolated from selected serum samples obtained from eight subjects. Seven of them (six patients and one control subject) had high levels of antioxidized LDL antibody during screening. The other subject, a healthy volunteer, had a low level of antibody. All purified antibodies contained IgG (of subclasses 1 and 3) as the predominant isotype and were primarily specific for oxidized LDL but showed some cross-reactivity with malondialdehyde-modified LDL and native LDL. Two of the purified antibodies cross-reacted with cardiolipin. We determined average dissociation constants for the antioxidized LDL antibodies purified from five individuals, which varied between 2.4 x 10(-7) and 7.5 x 10(-7) mol/L, whereas the average dissociation constant of rabbit hyperimmune anti-LDL antibody was determined to be 2.7 x 10(-8) mol/L. In conclusion, we have purified human autoantibodies reactive with oxidized LDL that appear to be predominantly of moderate-to-low affinity and of variable cross-reactivity. The predominance of IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies is significant from the standpoint of potential pathogenicity, since these two subclasses activate the classic complement pathway system and have the highest binding affinities for Fc gamma receptors on phagocytic cells.', 26956082: u'A leading hypothesis of N-acyl ethanolamine (NAE) biosynthesis, including the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide (AEA), is that it depends on hydrolysis of N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamines (NAPE) by a NAPE-specific phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD). Thus, deletion of NAPE-PLD should attenuate NAE levels. Previous analyses of two different NAPE-PLD knockout (KO) strains produced contradictory data on the importance of NAPE-PLD to AEA biosynthesis. Here, we examine this hypothesis with a strain of NAPE-PLD KO mice whose lipidome is uncharacterized. Using HPLC/MS/MS, over 70 lipids, including the AEA metabolite, N-arachidonoyl glycine (NAGly), the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonyl glycerol (2-AG) and prostaglandins (PGE(2) and PGF(2\\u03b1)), and over 60 lipoamines were analyzed in 8 brain regions of KO and wild-type (WT) mice. Lipidomics analysis of this third NAPE-PLD KO strain shows a broad range of lipids that were differentially affected by lipid species and brain region. Importantly, all 6 NAEs measured were significantly reduced, though the magnitude of the effect varied by fatty acid saturation length and brain region. 2-AG levels were only impacted in the brainstem, where levels were significantly increased in KO mice. Correspondingly, levels of arachidonic acid were significantly decreased exclusively in brainstem. NAGly levels were significantly increased in 4 brain regions and levels of PGE(2) increased in 6 of 8 brain regions in KO mice. These data indicate that deletion of NAPE-PLD has far broader effects on the lipidome than previously recognized. Therefore, behavioral characteristics of suppressing NAPE-PLD activity may be due to a myriad of effects on lipids and not simply due to reduced AEA biosynthesis.', 3537630: 'Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a state of self-induced malnutrition characterized by a marked pursuit of thinness and the fear of obesity.

One of the used strategies comprises an evaluation of the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL). There are contradictory data on the value of this strategy. During one month, 21 Flemish general practitioners evaluated the IADL capacities of all subjects older than 65 years with whom they had contact. Subjects with dementia and/or living in a residential home for the elderly were excluded. Housing and living conditions, medication use and IADL were registered. The general practitioner formulated a clinical evaluation. All subjects with an IADL score > or = 1 and a random sample from the group IADL = 0 underwent a Mini Mental State Examination. Subjects with an IADL score = 4 were referred for neuropsychological and specialist examination. The average age of the 1003 registered subjects was 75.1 years (SD = 6.8). A large majority of them (85%) were totally independent. There was a large discrepancy between the family's and the patient's judgment on the presence of memory problems. There was an inverse correlation between the IADL and MMSE: when the IADL score increased, the MMSE score fell. The diagnostic value of the IADL for the diagnosis of dementia with Camdex-N as a reference standard could not be evaluated because the number of tested subjects was too small. Against the MMSE, sensitivity was 0.81 (SE = 0.03), and specificity was 0.48 (SE = 0.05). The evaluation of the IADL activities had some drawbacks as a detection method for dementia but the use of IADL data may still be clinically valuable in general practice. The correlation between the general practitioner's judgment and that of the specialist was very good.

Sleep disorders and sleep-disordered breathing increase the risk for stroke, probably by influencing systemic and cerebral blood circulation, causing hypoxaemia during night. This theory is supported by the fact of higher prevalence of stroke in the morning. During REM sleep there is a higher requirement for oxygen; as most sleep apnoeas occur during REM, it is possible that there is a relative hypoxaemia during this sleep stage. Stroke, including hemispheric stroke, can cause or aggravate the pre-existing sleep-disordered breathing.

Prevalence of this entity is between 3 and 66%, depending of the patients and the pathology. Pressure ulcer is associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. One of the most important risk factors to develop a pressure ulcer is nutritional status. We can use different interventional strategies, first of all (primary intervention) before the patient has developed a ulcer and secondly, the treatment of a established ulcer (secondary prevention). In the most important primary prevention study with 662 patients, two oral nutritional supplements per day were given to the patients. The incidence of pressure ulcer was 40% (118/295) in the interventional group and 48% (181/377) in control group.

Pathophysiologically the disease has now been generally accepted as an acquired defect of phosphatidylinositol glycan (PIG)-anchored molecules on the cell surface of bone marrow-derived cells. This defect is functionally characterized by an abnormal susceptibility to complement-mediated lysis and has been described on erythrocytes, granulocytes, monocytes, and platelets. In contrast, contradictory data exist so far on the involvement of lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells. Using monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against newly defined PIG-linked surface structures such as CD48, CD55, and CD59, which are homogeneously expressed on lymphocytes of normal donors, we analyzed lymphocytes and their subpopulations in nine PNH patients by two color immunofluorescence. Our results showed that CD3+ T cells as well as CD16+ NK cells are at least partially involved in the deficient PIG-molecule surface expression. To more clearly define the defect in PNH, we generated NK clones from a PNH patient. Phenotypic analysis of these NK clones showed that they either were positive (n = 3) for PIG-linked surface structures such as CD48, CD55, and CD59 (eg, NKP1) or were completely negative (n = 7) for all of them (eg, NKP1). In functional tests the PIG-molecule negative clone NKP2 showed increased susceptibility to human complement compared with the PIG molecule positive clone NKP1. When analyzing the mRNA levels of the PIG-linked molecules CD55 and CD59 there was no difference at all between the two clones. We conclude from our data that NK cells as well as other lymphocyte subpopulations are involved in the PIG-linkage defect of PNH.

Effects of morphine were determined for three temperature comparisons (ie, hot/neutral, cold/neutral, and hot/cold). Aged rats were more sensitive to cold stimulation during baseline. Morphine produced antinociception during hot thermal stimulation, but had no effect on cold stimulation. The antinociceptive (and locomotor-altering) effects of morphine were attenuated in aged rats.

Contradictory data for response of melanoma to histamine have been reported.

Cellular proliferation was measured by the uptake of [3H]-thymidine. Cyclic AMP production was also measured to determine the receptor status of the cell lines. Histamine significantly stimulated growth in two of four cell lines, with maximal stimulation at 1 x 10(-8) M. This effect was inhibited by all four antagonists in a dose-dependent manner. Histamine [10(-7) to 10(-4) M] also induced a dose-dependent increase in cyclic AMP production in the two histamine-responsive cell lines, suggesting that these cell lines express H2 receptors.

The most consistent effects of estrogens on coagulation proteins are elevations of fibrinogen; factors II, VII, IX, X, and XII; protein C; and plasminogen. Although these elevations have been attributed to the estrogenic component in oral contraceptives, the progestogen concentration may also influence these increases. Among other coagulation proteins studied, the following are unaffected by oral contraceptive use: factors V, VIII, and XI; prekallikrein; and high-molecular-weight kininogen. In contrast, protein S values are decreased. The plasma concentration of plasmin inhibitor is unchanged, whereas both proteinase inhibitor and macroglobulin are significantly increased by oral contraceptive use.

Research in the last decades has shown that the various components of the Notch signaling cascade are either upregulated or activated in human cancers. Therefore, its downregulation stands as a promising and powerful strategy for cancer therapy. Here, we discuss the recent advances in the development of small molecule inhibitors, blocking antibodies and oligonucleotides that hinder Notch activity, and their outcome in clinical trials. Although Notch was initially identified as an oncogene, later studies showed that it can also act as a tumor suppressor in certain contexts. Further complexity is added by the existence of numerous Notch family members, which exert different activities and can be differentially targeted by inhibitors, potentially accounting for contradictory data on their therapeutic efficacy. Notably, recent evidence supports the rationale for combinatorial treatments including Notch inhibitors, which appear to be more effective than single agents in fighting cancer.', 17141594: 'It remains a goal of pediatric nutrition to provide optimal nourishment for infants who are not fed human milk.

This chapter intends to summarize an area of pediatric nutrition that has yielded both enlightening evidence and seemingly contradictory data.', 21423454: u'Phencyclidine (PCP) induces a behavioral syndrome in rodents that bears remarkable similarities to some of the core symptoms observed in schizophrenic patients, among those cognitive deficits. The successful alleviation of cognitive impairments associated with schizophrenia (CIAS) has become a major focus of research efforts as they remain largely untreated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of selected antipsychotic and cognition enhancing drugs, namely haloperidol, risperidone, donepezil, and modafinil in an animal model widely used in preclinical schizophrenia research. To this end, the novel object recognition (NOR) task was applied to rats abstinent following sub-chronic treatment with PCP. Rats were administered either PCP (5\\u2009mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle twice a day for 7\\u2009days, followed by a 7-day washout period, before testing in NOR. Upon testing, vehicle-treated rats successfully discriminated between novel and familiar objects, an effect abolished in rats that had previously been exposed to PCP treatment. Acute treatment with modafinil (64\\u2009mg/kg, p.o.) ameliorated the PCP-induced deficit in novel object exploration, whereas haloperidol (0.1\\u2009mg/kg, s.c.), risperidone (0.2\\u2009mg/kg, i.p.), and donepezil (3\\u2009mg/kg, p.o.) were without significant effect. Given the negligible efficacy of haloperidol and risperidone, and the contradictory data with donepezil to treat CIAS in the clinic, together with the promising preliminary pro-cognitive effects of modafinil in certain subsets of schizophrenic patients, the sub-chronic PCP-NOR abstinence paradigm may represent an attractive option for the identification of potential novel treatments for CIAS.', 22888799: 'Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in both men and women in the developed countries. Despite this fact, females are still under-represented in the majority of clinical trials. At the present time, only limited evidence is available with respect to the female-specific aspects of pathogenesis, management, and outcomes in acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Women less frequently undergo coronary intervention, and a lower proportion of women receive evidence-based pharmacotherapy, compared with men. It has been shown that women benefit from an invasive approach and coronary intervention in ACS as much as men, despite their advanced age and higher rate of bleeding complications. Also, administration of beta-blockers, ACE-inhibitors, and intensive statin therapy is associated with a comparable reduction of cardiovascular event rates in women and men. On the other hand, women may profit less than men from fibrinolytic or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor therapy. Both sexes benefit equally from aspirin therapy, whereas contradictory data are available on the efficacy of clopidogrel in women. There is an urgent need for intensive research in the development of female-specific therapeutic strategy in ACS, even though the detailed mechanisms of sex differences are still unknown.', 7716706: 'The study of aPL antibodies and the APS has appealed to large numbers of investigators over the last decade. This accounts, in part, for the great degree of apparently contradictory data being published. What seems certain is that these antibodies are associated with thrombosis and recurrent pregnancy loss, and animal data suggest a direct role in pathogenesis. In vitro studies demonstrate that these antibodies have a variety of functional effects on the hemostatic system, giving further credence to an antibody role in thrombosis. Further studies will doubtless give better insight into the mechanisms of antibody action and this will provide a more rational basis for treatment.', 6337900: 'To explain the contradictory data on the secretion of prostacyclin (PGI2) in clinical and experimental diabetes, we have investigated the effect of each of the major metabolic abnormalities in uncontrolled diabetes on vascular PGI2 synthesis. An increase in fatty acid concentrations caused a dose-dependent inhibition of PGI2 synthesis by rat aortic rings in vitro; linoleic and linolenic acids were consistently the most and palmitic the least inhibitory. Glucose had a stimulatory effect between 10 and 30 mmol/L, but a progressive fall in stimulation occurred at higher concentrations. Insulin was inhibitory at 10 and 50 mU/L; however, in combination with glucose (10 mmol/L) it was significantly stimulatory (at 10 mU/L) when the aortic rings were preincubated for 2 and 4 h. A pH of 7.0 or less was significantly inhibitory, whereas ketone bodies had no significant effect on PGI2 synthesis. These data show for the first time that altered metabolic factors in uncontrolled diabetes may have different effects on vascular PGI2 synthesis. These data help explain the variability of observations related to PGI2 synthesis and secretion in diabetes, and advocate a more detailed definition of the metabolic status of patients/animals used in such experiments.', 15817070: StringElement('Previous research on the prognostic relevance of p21(WAF1/CIP1) in oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) yielded inconclusive and contradictory data.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'BACKGROUND', u'Label': u'BACKGROUND'}), 24188271: 'In recent years, the growth of the functional foods industry has increased research into new compounds with high added value for use in the fortification of traditional products. One of the most promising functional food groups is those enriched in antioxidant compounds of a lipophilic nature. In spite of the numerous advantages reported for such antioxidant molecules, they may also have disadvantages that impede their use in functional foods, although these problems may well avoided by the use of encapsulant agents such as cyclodextrins. This explains the recent increase in the number of research papers dealing with the complexation of different guest molecules possesing important antioxidant properties using natural and modified cyclodextrins. This paper presents a review of the most recent studies on the complexes formed between several important types of antioxidant compounds and cyclodextrins, focusing on the contradictory data reported in the literature concerning to the antioxidant activity of the host/guest molecule complexes, the different complexation constants reported for identical complexes, the bioavailability of the antioxidant compound in the presence of cyclodextrins and recommendation concerning the use of natural or modified cyclodextrins. Moreover, the use of cyclodextrins as antibrowning agents to prevent enzymatic browning in different foods is revised.

This cross-sectional study included 739 children divided into quartiles of birth weight. The mean values of both systolic and diastolic pressure were significantly different between quartiles of birth weight, with increasing blood pressure values as the birth weight decreased (P<0.001). Covariance analysis adjusting for gender, prematurity, and body mass index (BMI) showed that both systolic and diastolic pressure remained greater in the lowest than in the highest birth weight quartile.

Most previous contributions in this field assessed quantitative EEG differences between healthy controls, MCI and Alzheimer's disease(AD) cases leading to contradictory data. In terms of MCI conversion to AD, certain longitudinal studies proposed various quantitative EEG parameters for an a priori distinction between PMCI and stable MCI. However, cross-sectional comparisons revealed a substantial overlap in these parameters between MCI patients and elderly controls. Methodological differences including variable clinical definition of MCI cases and substantial interindividual differences within the MCI group could partly explain these discrepancies. Most importantly, EEG measurements without cognitive demand in both cross-sectional and longitudinal designs have demonstrated limited sensitivity and generally do not produce significant group differences in spectral EEG parameters. Since the evolution of AD is characterized by the progressive loss of functional connectivity within neocortical association areas, event-modulated EEG dynamic analysis which makes it possible to investigate the functional activation of neocortical circuits may represent a more sensitive method to identify early alterations of neuronal networks predictive of AD development among MCI cases. The present review summarizes clinically significant results of EEG activation studies in this field and discusses future perspectives of research aiming to reach an early and individual prediction of cognitive decline in healthy elderly controls.\", 29323137: 'Contradictory data have been presented regarding the implication of the NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of vision loss in the Western world. Recognizing that antibody specificity may explain this discrepancy and in line with recent National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines requiring authentication of key biological resources, the specificity of anti-NLRP3 antibodies was assessed to elucidate whether non-immune RPE cells express NLRP3. Using validated resources, NLRP3 was not detected in human primary or human established RPE cell lines under multiple inflammasome-priming conditions, including purported NLRP3 stimuli in RPE such as DICER1 deletion and Alu RNA transfection. Furthermore, NLRP3 was below detection limits in ex vivo macular RPE from AMD patients, as well as in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived RPE from patients with overactive NLRP3 syndrome (Chronic infantile neurologic cutaneous and articulate, CINCA syndrome).

Unfortunately, the results of recent trials are disappointing. Most of them indicated that (contrary to experimental studies) CLA were not profitable in adipose tissue mass decrease in humans. Moreover, in a few cases a deterioration of serum lipid profile, glycemia enhancement and decrease of tissue insulin sensitivity were observed. Thus, there is no evidence confirming the positive influence of CLA on adipose tissue mass in humans. However, there are also a few publications, in which the CLA-associated decrease of adipose tissue mass in humans was noted.

However, contradictory data has emerged concerning the diagnostic accuracy of the most popular PCR assays that target either the 16S ribosomal RNA (rrs) or the subsurface lipoprotein (LipL32) genes. In order to clarify the effect of the gene target, a novel hydrolysis probe-based, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay targeting the LipL32 gene was developed, validated, and then compared directly to the previously described rrs hydrolysis probe-based qPCR using a convenience collection of canine urine samples. The novel LipL32 qPCR assay was linear from 5.9 \\xd7 10(6) to 59 genome equivalents per reaction. Both the LipL32 and the rrs qPCR assays showed a limit of detection of 10 target copies per reaction indicating an approximately equivalent analytical sensitivity. Both assays amplified all 20 pathogenic leptospiral strains tested but did not amplify a representative collection of bacteria commonly found in voided canine urine. When the field samples were assayed, 1 and 5 out of 184 samples yielded an amplification signal in the LipL32 and rrs assays, respectively. Nevertheless, when the limit of detection was considered as the cutoff for interpreting findings, the 4 discordant cases were judged as negative. In conclusion, our study confirmed that both LipL32 and rrs are suitable targets for qPCR for the detection of leptospiral DNA in canine urine. However, the rrs target requires the mandatory use of a cutoff value in order to correctly interpret spurious amplifications.', 15893056: \"Producing literature reviews of complex evidence for policymaking questions is a challenging methodological area. There are several established and emerging approaches to such reviews, but unanswered questions remain, especially around how to begin to make sense of large data sets drawn from heterogeneous sources. Drawing on Kuhn's notion of scientific paradigms, we developed a new method-meta-narrative review-for sorting and interpreting the 1024 sources identified in our exploratory searches. We took as our initial unit of analysis the unfolding 'storyline' of a research tradition over time. We mapped these storylines by using both electronic and manual tracking to trace the influence of seminal theoretical and empirical work on subsequent research within a tradition. We then drew variously on the different storylines to build up a rich picture of our field of study. We identified 13 key meta-narratives from literatures as disparate as rural sociology, clinical epidemiology, marketing and organisational studies. Researchers in different traditions had conceptualised, explained and investigated diffusion of innovations differently and had used different criteria for judging the quality of empirical work. Moreover, they told very different over-arching stories of the progress of their research. Within each tradition, accounts of research depicted human characters emplotted in a story of (in the early stages) pioneering endeavour and (later) systematic puzzle-solving, variously embellished with scientific dramas, surprises and 'twists in the plot'. By first separating out, and then drawing together, these different meta-narratives, we produced a synthesis that embraced the many complexities and ambiguities of 'diffusion of innovations' in an organisational setting. We were able to make sense of seemingly contradictory data by systematically exposing and exploring tensions between research paradigms as set out in their over-arching storylines. In some traditions, scientific revolutions were identifiable in which breakaway researchers had abandoned the prevailing paradigm and introduced a new set of concepts, theories and empirical methods. We concluded that meta-narrative review adds value to the synthesis of heterogeneous bodies of literature, in which different groups of scientists have conceptualised and investigated the 'same' problem in different ways and produced seemingly contradictory findings. Its contribution to the mixed economy of methods for the systematic review of complex evidence should be explored further.\", 22525851: u'There is no doubt that vitamin D deficiency is the cause of several metabolic bone diseases, but vitamin D status is also linked to many major human diseases including immune disorders. Mounting data strengthen the link between vitamin D and diabetes, in particular T1D and T2D. Despite some inconsistencies between studies that associate serum 25(OH)D levels with the risk of developing T1D or T2D, there seems to be an overall trend for an inverse correlation between levels of 25(OH)D and both disorders. There is also compelling evidence that 1,25(OH)2D regulates b-cell function by different mechanisms, such as influencing insulin secretion by regulating intracellular levels of Ca2+, increasing \\u03b2-cell resistance to apoptosis, and perhaps also increasing \\u03b2-cell replication. The capacity of vitamin D, more specifically 1,25(OH)2D, to modulate immune responses is of particular interest for both the therapy and prevention of diabetes. In the case of T1D, vitamin D supplementation in prediabetic individuals could help prevent or reduce the initiation of autoimmune processes possibly by regulating thymic selection of the T-cell repertoire, decreasing the numbers of autoreactive T cells, and inducing Treg cells. Although immune modulation is generally discussed for the treatment of T1D, it is also relevant for T2D. Indeed, recent studies have shown that T2D patients have increased systemic inflammation and that this state can induce \\u03b2-cell dysfunction and death. Supplementation trials with regular vitamin D for the protection against the development of T1D and T2D have generated some contradictory data, but many weaknesses can be identified in these trials as most were underpowered or open-labeled. However, the overwhelming strength of preclinical data and of the observational studies make vitamin D or its analogues strong candidates for the prevention or treatment of diabetes or its complications. However, proof of causality needs well-designed clinical trials and if positive, adequate dosing, regimen, and compound studies are needed to define the contribution of vitamin D status and therapy in the global diabetes problem. There are many confounding factors that need to be taken into consideration when translating successful vitamin D therapies in animal models into humans, for example, gender, age, lifestyle, and genetic background. To come to solid conclusions on the potential of vitamin D or its analogues in the prevention of or therapy for all forms of diabetes, it is clear that large prospective trials with carefully selected populations and end points will be needed, but should also receive high priority.', 10914719: 'Early systemic spread of occult tumor cells that may develop into founders of incurable distant metastasis has been identified in prostate cancer patients by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) amplification of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) mRNA. Nevertheless, the introduction of this new staging tool into the clinical setting has been hampered by the disparate and contradictory data on the sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR methods reported recently. We used PSA RT-PCR to examine the influence of analytical variables such as priming and enzyme of reverse transcriptase reaction, temperature and time of primer annealing, primer extension and denaturation, as well as the concentrations of magnesium chloride, Taq polymerase, deoxynucleotide triphosphate, primers and BSA on the amplification process. By systematically varying these chemical and physical components, we could demonstrate a significant increase in amplification yield and in stringency of primer annealing. This may explain the wide variety of published findings on molecular staging of prostate cancer, which currently impedes the clinical introduction of PSA RT-PCR assays in prostate cancer.

In the present study the methyl thiazol tetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assay was used to compare the in vitro cytotoxicity of 14 drugs between 60 My+ (CD13+ and/or CD33+) and 107 My- ALL children at initial diagnosis. P-glycoprotein (P-gp), multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP), major vault protein/lung resistance protein (LRP) and the intracellular daunorubicin concentration were studied by flow cytometry. My+ ALL samples were significantly more resistant, i.e. between 1.1- and 2.9-fold, to daunorubicin, doxorubicin, idarubicin, mitoxantrone, vincristine, 6-thioguanine, 6-mercaptopurine, teniposide, etoposide and ifosfamide compared with My- ALL samples. My- and My+ ALL did not significantly differ in sensitivity to prednisolone, dexamethasone, L-asparaginase and cytarabine. Comparable results were found when only common and preB ALL cases were analysed. Drug resistance in My+ ALL was not related to increased expression of P-gp, MRP or LRP compared with My- ALL (ratio My+/My-:P-gp 0.8, MRP 1.0, LRP 1.1). Accumulation and retention of daunorubicin did not significantly differ between My- and My+ ALL cells (ratio My+/My-: accumulation 1.2, retention 1.3). Therefore the nature of drug resistance in My+ ALL remains unknown. The lack of prognostic value for My+ in childhood ALL may be explained by the responsiveness of My+ ALL to glucocorticoids, L-asparaginase and cytarabine. In addition, the currently intensive treatment regimens may apply drug doses which are simply high enough to overcome the mild resistance to anthracyclines, mitoxantrone, vincristine, thiopurines, epipodophyllotoxins and ifosfamide in childhood My+ ALL.', 23662578: 'A number of publications contain contradictory data about influence of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) on B-lymphocyte growth, differentiation and production of immunoglobulins (Ig).

Co-cultivation of Namalva cells with MSC stimulated their proliferation, decreased the doubling time and the minimal effective seeding dose and therefore made cloning of these lymphoblastoid cells possible. The presence of MSC supported the survival and proliferation of Namalva cells cultivated in growth factor deficient medium. MSC also stimulated proliferation of U266 myeloma cells. Both MSC derived from adipose tissue from the healthy donors and from patients with breast cancer effectively stimulated B-cell lines proliferation. Presence of MSC in mixed cultures had no influence on the production of IgM or IgE by Namalva or U266 cells respectively. Co-cultivation of Namalva or U266 with MSC resulted in the formation of close intercellular contacts between cells of both types.', 12729587: 'There is considerable evidence that the oxidative phosphorylation capacity of human mitochondria declines in various tissues with aging. However, the genetic basis of this phenomenon has not yet been clarified. The occurrence of large deletions in mtDNA from brain, skeletal, and heart muscles and other tissues of old subjects at relatively low levels has been well documented. We discuss their possible functional relevance for the aging processes. On the contrary, until very recently, only inconclusive and often discordant evidence was available for the accumulation of mtDNA point mutations in old individuals. In the past few years, however, an aging-dependent large accumulation of mtDNA point mutations has been demonstrated in the majority of individuals above a certain age. These mutations occur in the mtDNA main control region at critical sites for mtDNA replication in fibroblasts and skeletal muscles. The extraordinary tissue specificity and nucleotide selectivity of these mutations strongly support the idea of their being functionally relevant. Evidence in agreement with this conclusion has been provided by the very recent observation that an mtDNA mutation occurring in blood leukocytes near an origin of replication, which causes a remodeling of this origin, occurs at a strikingly higher frequency in centenarians and monozygotic and dizygotic twins than in the control populations, strongly pointing to its survival value. The present article reviews another area of active research and discussion, namely, the role of pathogenic mtDNA mutations in causing programmed cell death. The available evidence has clearly shown that mtDNA and respiration are not essential for the process of apoptosis. However, the limited and sometimes contradictory data indicate that the absence or impaired function of mtDNA can influence the rate of this process, most probably by regulating the production of reactive oxygen species or the lack thereof.', 20875703: 'Major depression is a chronic, recurring and potentially life-threatening illness that affects up to 10% of the population worldwide. Pharmacological and genetic studies highlight the serotonergic system as being a key player in the disorder. However, despite drugs designed to boost serotonin transmission represent the first line of therapy for depression, the role of this system still remains elusive. Here, I propose a new theoretical framework, the undirected susceptibility to change model, potentially accounting for the experimental and clinical results concerning the role of this neurotransmitter in depression. Since the capacity of the individual to change its physiology and behavior according to the environment is dependent on neural plasticity which, in turn, is controlled by serotonin, I assume that changes in the levels of serotonin affect the sensitivity to the environment. Consequently, the undirected susceptibility to change model predicts that an increase of serotonin levels, for instance induced through selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) administration, does not affect mood per se, but--acting as a catalyzer--enhances neural plasticity and, thus, the effects of the environment on mood. However, since the environment can be either supportive or adverse, its effects can be beneficial or detrimental. Therefore enhancing the serotonin system can increase the likelihood both of developing the psychopathology and recovering from it. This model, on the one hand, suggests an explanation for the limited SSRI efficacy described in clinical studies and allows apparently contradictory data to be reconciled; on the other, it describes neural plasticity as a double edged sword that, according to the quality of the environment, may have either positive or negative consequences.', 12194748: StringElement('Bcl-2 family members mediate anti-apoptotic signals in a wide variety of human cell systems.

Yet, some recent evidence suggests that thymic selection, and co-receptors may have misled us into thinking the TCR is exclusively MHC-specific, when in fact, TCRs can robustly engage non-MHC ligands when given the chance.

The aim of this review was to discuss the putative roles of mitochondria in mammalian sperm function and how they may relate to sperm quality and fertilisation ability, particularly in humans. Although paternal mitochondria are degraded inside the zygote, sperm mitochondrial functionality seems to be critical for fertilisation. Indeed, changes in mitochondrial integrity/functionality, namely defects in mitochondrial ultrastructure or in the mitochondrial genome, transcriptome or proteome, as well as low mitochondrial membrane potential or altered oxygen consumption, have been correlated with loss of sperm function (particularly with decreased motility). Results from genetically engineered mouse models also confirmed this trend. On the other hand, increasing evidence suggests that mitochondria derived ATP is not crucial for sperm motility and that glycolysis may be the main ATP supplier for this particular aspect of sperm function. However, there are contradictory data in the literature regarding sperm bioenergetics. The relevance of sperm mitochondria may thus be associated with their role in other physiological features, particularly with the production of ROS, which in controlled levels are needed for proper sperm function. Sperm mitochondria may also serve as intracellular Ca\\xb2\\u207a stores, although their role in signalling is still unclear.', 16552394: 'Atherosclerosis is a progressive pathological process based on endothelial dysfunction and chronic inflammation. Monocytes, macrophages, and modified lipoproteins, especially oxidized LDLs (oxLDLs), play a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Monocytes evolve into macrophages in the vascular wall and then accumulate oxLDLs, forming foam cells. OxLDLs are toxic and activate foam cells, stimulate the replication of macrophages and their migration into atherosclerotic plaque, and increase the expression of metaloproteinases. Macrophages bind oxLDLs through many types of receptors, among them scavenger receptors. One of these is CD36, a membrane glycoprotein expressed by endothelial cells, adipocytes, smooth and skeletal muscle cells, cardiomiocytes, platelets, monocytes, and macrophages. CD36 recognizes and binds many ligands, such as oxLDLs, long-chain fatty acids, collagen, thrombospondin 1, apoptotic cells, anionic phospholipids, and Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes. CD36 is involved in many processes, e.g. inner immune system responses, removal of apoptotic cells and Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes, and the transport of long-chain fatty acids, and it also mediates collagen and thrombospondin action. Recent reports indicate that CD36 may play a role in the development of atherosclerosis. An animal model revealed that lack of CD36 expression restrains atheroslerosis. Increased expression of CD36 was shown in atheroslerotic plaque and damaged vascular tissue.

In agreement with this hypothesis, the whole-body production of NO has been found to be increased in PH, and the measurement of NOS mRNA expression in different organs suggest that the splanchnic vascular system is a major source of NO release. Consequently, NO could play a role in the development of the splanchnic hyperaemia, collateral circulation and portal hypertensive gastropathy. Furthermore, increased generation of NO in central circulation likely accounts for pulmonary vasorelaxation and cardiac dysfunction found in cirrhosis. By contrast, PH-associated endothelial dysfunction seems to invalidate the capability of intrahepatic and intrarenal vasculature to produce NO. A deficient NO release in these vascular territories might contribute to enhancement of PH and development of the hepatorenal syndrome. Overall NO hyperproduction is either the cause (induction of iNOS) or the consequence (stimulation of ecNOS) of the hyperdynamic syndrome. This incertitude results from the yet undefined significance of mild and transitory activation of the endotoxin-cytokines axis for iNOS induction and contradictory data on specific iNOS and ecNOS activities. A contribution of each isoform of NOS to pathogenesis of the hyperdynamic syndrome probably depends on the model of PH in animal studies and the aetiology or severity of cirrhosis in human studies.', 27063256: 'Berberine is a quaternary ammonium salt from the protoberberine group of isoquinoline alkaloids found in such plants as gender Berberis. Berberine is recognised to improve glucose and lipid metabolism disorders and preliminary clinical evidences suggest the ability of berberine to reduce endothelial inflammation improving vascular health, even in patients already affected by cardiovascular diseases, suggesting a possible interesting role of berberine and its metabolites in clinical practice. However, its physicochemical properties, pharmacokinetic, and metabolism are not fully elucidated and contradictory data have been reported. This review provides a summary regarding the pharmacological and biological features of berberine, with a focus on berberine as well as their pharmacologically active metabolites and the different mechanisms underlying their activities in order to clarify the correct use of berberine supplementation, alone or in association with other nutraceuticals, for the management of metabolic disorders associated to increased cardiovascular disease risk. A particular attention has also been given to the available clinical trials assessing its short- and middle- term use tolerability, safety and efficacy in various conditions, such as dyslipidaemia, impaired fasting glucose, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes.', 10093018: StringElement(\"Many states require hospitals to complete a form for each patient who dies, reporting the patient's organ and tissue donation eligibility status, whether a request was made, and the outcome of the request.

The authors reviewed ICD-induced psychopathology in 2005. During the past 2 years the number of studies examining psychopathology and quality of life after ICD implantation has increased dramatically, warranting this update of that review. Variables assessed have included recipient age, gender, social support network, perception of control and predictability of shocks, and personality style. Now the picture of what is known is, if anything, cloudier than it was 2 years ago, with little definitive and much contradictory data emerging in most of these categories.', 756169: 'By means of microiontophoresis chlordiazepoxide (CDP) was applied to the neurons of rabbit sensorimotor cortex. CDP decreased the frequency of spontaneous electrical activity of all the neurons studied in a dose-dependent manner. During simultaneous CDP and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) application an additive effect of the agents was observed. No antagonism between CDP and GABA was found. Probable reasons for contradictory data obtained by different AA. dealing with benzodiazepine effect on GABA-ergic inhibitory processes are discussed.', 10027515: \"The hyperlocomotor effect of the serotonin (5-HT)1A,B receptor agonist 5-methoxy-3-(1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-4-pyridinyl)-1H-indole (RU 24969) has been repeatedly reported. However, 5-HT1A receptors, 5-HT1B receptors (or both) have been claimed to mediate this effect of RU 24969. These contradictory data possibly arise from protocol differences, especially those related to animal species, drugs, and activity assessment. Herein, the influence of a pretreatment with the selective 5-HT1B,D receptor antagonist N-[4-methoxy3-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)phenyl]-2'-methyl-4'-(5me thyl-1,2,4-oxadiozol-3-yl)-biphenyl-4-carboxamide (GR 127935; 1, 3.3 and 10 mg/kg IP) on the hyperlocomotor effect of a 5 mg/kg (IP) dose of RU 24969 was studied in Wistar-Kyoto Hyperactive (WKHA) rats. In a first series of experiments, it was confirmed that RU 24969 (2.5 and 5 mg/kg), administered 10 min after the onset of activity recordings, increases locomotion dose-dependently (cage crossings). In a second series of experiments, administration of GR 127935 10 min after the onset of activity recordings promoted a dose-dependent decrease in basal activity (and rearings) and prevented (3.3 and 10 mg/kg) RU 24969-elicited locomotor activity. On the other hand, GR 127935 was ineffective against RU 24969-induced inhibition of rearings. Lastly, it was observed that 3.3 mg/kg GR 127935 did not affect the number of cage crossings and rearings displayed by rats administered 1.5 mg/kg D-amphetamine. This study shows that 5-HT1B receptors play a major role in the hyperlocomotor effect of RU 24969, at least under our experimental setting. Whether these receptors also play a tonic role in the high locomotor activity displayed by WKHA rats remains to be determined.\", 9755110: 'Tobacco smoke (TS) has been implicated as a major risk factor in human pulmonary diseases including cancer. In this study, we used TS as a model of oxidative stress. TS-mediated oxidative stress has been shown to induce protein oxidation, DNA damage, and cell death. Here we investigated, in human and rodent cell lines, whether TS induces cell death by apoptosis or by necrosis. As described for classic oxidants, TS induced apoptosis at low concentrations and necrosis at higher concentrations. We have previously described the induction of heat shock (HS) protein (HSP) (in particular, HSP70) in human monocytes exposed to TS. HSP70 is implicated in the regulation of cell injury and cell death and, in particular, modulates apoptosis, as does the antiapoptotic oncoprotein Bcl-2. At both apoptotic and necrotic concentrations, TS induced a dose-dependent HSP70 expression, whereas Bcl-2 was induced only at necrotic concentrations. TS- or HS-induced HSP had no protective effects either on apoptosis or on necrosis, but HSP70 overexpression prevented TS-induced necrosis and consequently led to increased apoptosis. These results might reconcile the apparently contradictory data previously reported on the effects of HSP on apoptosis.', 25783794: StringElement(\"Cancer cachexia represents a critical problem in clinical oncology due to its negative impact on patients' quality of life, therapeutic tolerance and survival.

Both patterns were maintained in fibrillarin-GFP expressing cells after fixation with formaldehyde. When the fixed fibrillarin-GFP expressing cells were used for immunolabeling with antibodies to fibrillarin, only the nucleoli with a weak GFP-signal became strongly labeled, whereas those with the heavy signals were only lightly stained, if at all. A similar pattern was observed if the cells were immunolabeled with antibodies to GFP. These observations suggest that an increase in antigen accumulation within the nucleolus, which could take place under various physiological or experimental conditions, could prevent the antigen from being recognized by specific antibodies. These results have implications regarding contradictory data on localization of various nucleolar antigens obtained by conventional immunocytochemistry.'}\n"
