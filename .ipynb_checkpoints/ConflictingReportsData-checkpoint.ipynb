      "{10866837: 'There have been conflicting reports of the clinical outcome of acute hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. A prospective study evaluated 432 patients with chronic hepatitis C (183 with cirrhosis) over a 7-year period. Of the 17 patients with concurrent HAV infection, seven developed fulminant hepatitis and six died. None of these patients had cirrhosis; however, the HLA phenotype (A1; B8:DR3) appeared to be a significant factor in the development of fulminant hepatitis. Patients with this phenotype had high titres of antinuclear antibodies, antismooth muscle antibodies and antiasialoglycoprotein-receptor antibodies, possibly reflecting the induction of autoimmune hepatitis in this group. The high frequency of fulminant hepatitis in patients with HAV/HCV coinfection contrasts with other surveys, although a large Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) survey demonstrated that HAV infection in patients with pre-existing chronic liver disease (CLD) is associated with increased mortality. It is likely that CLD has some importance as an underlying factor in the development of fulminant hepatitis following HAV infection. Further prospective studies are needed to clarify this issue.', 17020930: 'Human rhinovirus (HRV)-induced respiratory infections are associated with elevated levels of IFN-gamma-inducible protein 10 (IP-10), which is an enhancer of T lymphocyte chemotaxis and correlates with symptom severity and T lymphocyte number. Increased IP-10 expression is exhibited by airway epithelial cells following ex vivo HRV challenge and requires intracellular viral replication; however, there are conflicting reports regarding the necessity of type I IFN receptor ligation for IP-10 expression. Furthermore, the involvement of resident airway immune cells, predominantly bronchoalveolar macrophages, in contributing to HRV-stimulated IP-10 elaboration remains unclear. In this regard, our findings demonstrate that ex vivo exposure of human peripheral blood monocytes and bronchoalveolar macrophages (monocytic cells) to native or replication-defective HRV serotype 16 (HRV16) resulted in similarly robust levels of IP-10 release, which occurred in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, HRV16 induced a significant increase in type I IFN (IFN-alpha) release and STAT1 phosphorylation in monocytes. Neutralization of the type I IFN receptor and inhibition of JAK or p38 kinase activity strongly attenuated HRV16-stimulated STAT1 phosphorylation and IP-10 release. Thus, this work supports a model, wherein HRV16-induced IP-10 release by monocytic cells is modulated via autocrine/paracrine action of type I IFNs and subsequent JAK/STAT pathway activity. Our findings demonstrating robust activation of monocytic cells in response to native and/or replication-defective HRV16 challenge represent the first evidence indicating a mechanistic disparity in the activation of macrophages when compared with epithelial cells and suggest that macrophages likely contribute to cytokine elaboration following HRV challenge in vivo.', 9413633: StringElement('To evaluate whether there is an association between the presence of t(14;18) and bcl-2 gene expression, on one hand, and clinical presentation and outcome, on the other hand, in patients with follicular small cleaved cell lymphoma (FSCCL) and diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLCL), in light of conflicting reports concerning the prognostic significance of these parameters.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'OBJECTIVE', u'Label': u'OBJECTIVE'}), 23509922: UnicodeElement(u'Ranieri VM, Thompson BT, Barie PS, Dhainaut JF, Douglas IS, Finfer S, G\\xe5rdlund B, Marshall JC, Rhodes A, Artigas A, Payen D, Tenhunen J, Al-Khalidi HR, Thompson V, Janes J, Macias WL, Vangerow B, Williams MD: Drotrecogin alfa (activated) in adult patients with septic shock.

This current is important for terminating bursts and hyperpolarizing the neuron during the interval between bursts and therefore contributes to the timing of pacemaker activity. A method for rapid extracellular perfusion of the neuron soma with solutions of different ionic composition was used to study the ionic dependence of the tail current. Measurements of the current-voltage relationship were made at different times during the decay of the tail current to determine the reversal potential in different ionic solutions. These experiments showed that 2 or more slow outward currents contribute to the tail current. Temperature had a large effect on these currents. At cold temperatures (10-15 degrees C), the tail current was predominantly a K current. At warm temperatures (20-23 degrees C), both a K current and a K-insensitive outward current were seen. Bursting pacemaker activity occurred throughout this temperature range. Both the K current and the K-insensitive current required Ca influx for activation. These findings help to reconcile conflicting reports in the literature concerning the ionic dependence of the slow outward tail current and suggest a mechanism for temperature compensation of bursting activity in these pacemaker cells.', 11206670: \"To date, the research literature has yielded conflicting reports regarding the specificity of antisaccade deficits to schizophrenia. We sought to examine antisaccade and working memory task performance in schizophrenia patients and bipolar patients, as well as to examine the relationship between the two tasks in both patient populations. Thirty-four schizophrenia patients, 20 bipolar patients, and 30 nonpatient controls were administered saccadic inhibition (antisaccade), working memory, and sensorimotor tasks. Compared with the controls, the schizophrenia patients displayed both antisaccade deficits and working memory deficits. In contrast, the bipolar patients produced significantly more errors on the antisaccade task than the controls, though the bipolar group performed similarly to the control group on the working memory task. Mediational analyses demonstrated that working memory partially mediates the relationship between patients' diagnostic group status and antisaccade task performance; working memory performance contributed uniquely to the prediction of antisaccade task performance in the two patient groups. Antisaccade deficits do not appear specific to schizophrenia. The results suggest that in schizophrenia, working memory and antisaccade tasks are tapping similar cognitive processes, whereas in bipolar patients the processes underlying antisaccade and working memory performance are disparate.\", 21666477: StringElement('Advances in solid-phase tests for antibodies directed against HLA antigens have opened new areas of sophistication in detecting and characterizing the antibodies and have improved access to transplantation for sensitized candidates.

There are conflicting reports as to whether microvessel density (IMD) in breast cancers is associated with prognosis. This could be due to the use of different antibodies to endothelial cell markers, variation in tissue pretreatment protocols, and nonstandardized counting methods. We have assessed the IMD in 106 breast carcinomas using a pan-endothelial marker, CD34, and a recently described mAb to CD105, which preferentially reacts with endothelial cell in angiogenic tissues. IMD values (separated as above or below median) for CD105 expression showed a statistically significant correlation with overall (P = 0.0029) and disease-free survival (P = 0.0362). In contrast, blood vessel counts using a panendothelial marker CD34 did not correlate with overall or disease-free survival (P = 0.2912 and P = 03153, respectively). When IMD values were subdivided into quartiles and assessed for their prognostic values, there was a statistically significant difference in the overall survival across CD105, but not CD34, values (P = 0.0017 and P = 0.7997, respectively) and also disease-free survival (P = 0.0431 and P = 0.5066, respectively). Further analysis of IMD values demonstrated that there were no deaths in the lowest quartile for CD105 and it differed from the other three quartiles. However, examination of clinical details of patients in the lowest quartile failed to reveal clustering of patients known to be associated with low-risk factors. Multivariate analysis confirmed that IMD values using CD105 were an independent prognostic factor. These results suggest that the ability to quantitatively distinguish between tumor neovascularization and preexisting vessels may be important in the assessment of tumor angiogenesis, but requires confirmation in a greater number of patients with a longer follow-up.', 22773782: 'It has been proposed that the brain predicts the sensory consequences of a movement and compares it to the actual sensory feedback. When the two differ, an error signal is formed, driving adaptation. How does an error in one trial alter performance in the subsequent trial? Here we show that the sensitivity to error is not constant but declines as a function of error magnitude. That is, one learns relatively less from large errors compared with small errors. We performed an experiment in which humans made reaching movements and randomly experienced an error in both their visual and proprioceptive feedback. Proprioceptive errors were created with force fields, and visual errors were formed by perturbing the cursor trajectory to create a visual error that was smaller, the same size, or larger than the proprioceptive error. We measured single-trial adaptation and calculated sensitivity to error, i.e., the ratio of the trial-to-trial change in motor commands to error size. We found that for both sensory modalities sensitivity decreased with increasing error size. A reanalysis of a number of previously published psychophysical results also exhibited this feature. Finally, we asked how the brain might encode sensitivity to error. We reanalyzed previously published probabilities of cerebellar complex spikes (CSs) and found that this probability declined with increasing error size. From this we posit that a CS may be representative of the sensitivity to error, and not error itself, a hypothesis that may explain conflicting reports about CSs and their relationship to error.', 28577815: u'The use standardized testing in pre-licensure nursing programs has been accompanied by conflicting reports of effective practices. The purpose of this project was to describe standardized testing practices in one states\\' nursing programs and discover if the use of a cut score or oversight of remediation had any effect on (a) first time NCLEX\\xae pass rates, (b) on-time graduation (OTG) or (c) the combination of (a) and (b). Administrators of 38 nursing programs in one Southwest state were sent surveys; surveys were returned by 34 programs (89%). Survey responses were compared to each program\\'s NCLEX pass rate and on-time graduation rate; t-tests were conducted for significant differences associated with a required minimum score (cut score) and oversight of remediation. There were no significant differences in NCLEX pass or on-time graduation rates related to establishment of a cut score. There was a significant difference when the NCLEX pass rate and on-time graduation rate were combined (Outcome Index \"OI\") with significantly higher program outcomes (P=.02.) for programs without cut-scores. There were no differences associated with faculty oversight of remediation. The results of this study do not support establishment of a cut-score when implementing a standardized testing.', 19746842: \"Drug efflux by intestinal P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is recognized as a significant biochemical barrier affecting oral absorption for a number of drugs apart from the cytochrome P450 3A enzyme. Various conflicting reports have been published regarding the effects of grapefruit juice (GFJ) on P-gp mediated drug efflux, in which GFJ has been shown to have no effect, as an inhibitor effect or activation of the enzyme. Therefore the present study's objective was to provide clarification of previous findings, adopting a two-way approach, involving both single dose and multiple dosage regimens. Diltiazem (DTZ) 15 mg/kg was administered concomitantly with 5 ml/kg of GFJ to one group (n = 6) of male Wistar rats and another group (n = 6) of animals were provided distilled water with DTZ (the control). A third group of rats was administered GFJ orally for six days and on seventh day GFJ and DTZ were administered concomitantly. The Cmax and AUC of DTZ were decreased significantly in the presence of multiple dose treatment of GFJ. These data were also decreased in presence of simultaneous treatment of single dose GFJ. In vitro metabolism studies and gut sac experiments were conducted in order to understand the mechanism involved. In the liver S9 fraction prepared from the rats treated with multiple doses of GFJ, DTZ metabolism was significantly increased compared to the control. Furthermore, the amount of drug transported from the duodenum was reduced in GFJ treated rats compared to that of the control (1581.0 +/- 7.8 nM vs 1084.81 +/- 6.1 nM, respectively). Grapefruit juice was also reported to inhibit the organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP), an influx transporter thus reducing the blood levels of OATP substrates which was evident from the in vitro studies. The amount of drug transported from the duodenum was reduced in the presence of pravastatin, a specific OATP inhibitor (1581.0 +/- 7.8 nM to 1265.0 +/- 5.5 nM). Oral single dose exposure to GFJ showed no effect on P-gp, whereas multiple dose administration of GFJ resulted in increased levels of P-gp expression and decreased levels of OATP, thus showing a varied effect on intestinal absorption, and therefore overcoming the inhibition of DTZ metabolism in rats.\", 27424795: \"While Parkinson's disease (PD) is traditionally viewed as a motor disorder, there is mounting evidence that somatosensory function becomes affected as well. However, conflicting reports exist regarding whether plantar sensitivity is reduced in early-onset PD patients. Plantar sensitivity was assessed using monofilaments and a gold-standard, two-interval two-alternative forced choice vibrotactile detection task at both 30 and 250Hz. Lower-limb cutaneous reflexes were assessed by delivering continuous, sinusoidal vibration at 30 and 250Hz while recording muscle activity in Tibialis Anterior. We found no evidence of elevated plantar thresholds or dysfunctional lower-limb cutaneous reflexes in PD patients ON medication. We also found no acute effect of ceasing L-dopa intake on either plantar sensitivity or cutaneous reflexes. Our finding of intact cutaneous function in PD supports the further exploration of therapeutics that enhance plantar sensitivity to minimize postural instability, a source of considerable morbidity in this clinical population.\", 19703838: StringElement('There have been conflicting reports on the use of intravenous administration of sodium bicarbonate for prevention of contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI).

Whereas the responsiveness pattern of these mice have been clearly defined in terms of their ability or inability to make antibodies to certain classes of thymus-independent antigens, there are conflicting reports in regard to affinity maturation of the antibody response to thymus-dependent antigens. To resolve this controversial issue, the two major isotypes of the IgG response, namely IgG1 and IgG2a were examined with a highly sensitive radioimmunoassay that measures both the magnitude and affinity of the anti-2,4-dinitrophenyl antibody of each isotype in individual serum samples. It was found that the xid gene reduced the amount but not affinity of the IgG1 antibody produced, whereas it impaired the whole IgG2a responses severely. In fact, mice carrying the defective gene were unable to mount a secondary IgG2a response, measured either quantitatively or qualitatively in terms of increased affinity. To test the possibility that Lyb3, an isogenic B cell-triggering receptor lacking in xid-mutant mice, plays a direct role in the maturation of the immune response, the antibody profile in normal mice immunized eigher with antigen alone or in combination with anti-Lyb3 receptor substantially elevated and accelerated the primary IgG2a response, whereas it had little effect on the IgG1 response.', 14567458: StringElement('Cyclosporine is a fungal metabolite and a powerful immunosuppressant.

Ultimately, this paucimannose type structure is produced by an unusual beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, which removes the terminal N-acetylglucosamine residue from the upstream intermediate, Manalpha6(GlcNAcbeta2Manalpha3)Manbeta4GlcNAcbeta4GlcNAc-R. Because the N-glycan processing pathways leading to the production of this intermediate are probably identical in insects and higher eukaryotes, the presence or absence of this specific, processing beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase is a key factor distinguishing the processing pathways in these two different types of organisms. Recent studies have shown that the fused lobes (fdl) gene encodes the specific, processing beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase of Drosophila melanogaster. However, there are conflicting reports on the identity of the gene encoding this enzyme in the lepidopteran insect, Spodoptera frugiperda. One has suggested that a gene alternatively designated SfGlcNAcase-3 or SfHex encodes this function, whereas another has suggested that this gene encodes a broad-spectrum beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase that functions in glycan and chitin degradation. In this study we resolved this conflict by molecularly cloning an S. frugiperda fdl ortholog (Sf-fdl) and demonstrating that it encodes a product with the substrate specificity expected of the processing beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase. Moreover, we showed that the endogenous levels of specific, processing beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity were significantly reduced in S. frugiperda cells engineered to express a double-stranded RNA derived from the Sf-fdl gene. These results indicate that Sf-fdl encodes the specific, processing beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase of S. frugiperda and validate our previous suggestion that the broad-spectrum beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase encoded by the SfGlcNAcase-3/SfHex gene is more likely to be involved in N-glycan and/or chitin degradation.', 1284142: 'Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are established in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure; both conditions are complicated by resistance to insulin-mediated glucose disposal. The defect in essential hypertension is both tissue and pathway specific, i.e., confined to nonoxidative (glycogen synthetic) routes of intracellular glucose utilization in skeletal muscle, whereas heart failure and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) are associated with more widespread abnormalities of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Thus, the mechanisms of the insulin resistance in hypertension, NIDDM, and heart failure are fundamentally different, so metabolic responses to drug therapy may not be the same in all insulin-resistant states. There have been conflicting reports about the effects of ACE inhibitors on insulin sensitivity and glycemic control. A number of studies, both with captopril and with enalapril, have shown small increases in insulin sensitivity, and there is evidence that this is due to enhanced glucose uptake into skeletal muscle. The interpretation of these studies, however, is often compromised by poor trial design, lack of full placebo data, various indirect measurements of insulin sensitivity, and heterogeneous patient populations in whom the biochemical mechanisms of insulin resistance (and drug responses) may not be the same. Overall, there probably is a modest class effect of ACE inhibitors that enhances insulin-mediated glucose disposal; the mechanism of this effect is likely to be a combination of increased muscle blood flow, local renin-angiotensin system blockade, and elevated kinin levels.', 16842799: StringElement('The cardinal role of chronic inflammation in the development of atherosclerosis is increasingly being recognized.

Here we resolve these controversies by monitoring the kinetics of nucleotide-induced changes in enzyme structure. We show that the specificity constant for incorporation of a normal nucleotide (dCTP) is determined solely by the rate of binding (including isomerization) because isomerization to the closed complex commits the substrate to react. In contrast, a nucleoside analog (3TC-TP, triphosphate form of lamivudine) is incorporated slowly, allowing the conformational change to come to equilibrium and revealing tight nucleotide binding. Our data reconcile previously conflicting reports suggesting that nucleotide analogs bind tighter than normal nucleotides. Rather, dCTP and 3TC-TP bind with nearly equal affinities, but the binding of dCTP never reaches equilibrium. Discrimination against 3TC-TP is based on the slower rate of incorporation due to misalignment of the substrate and/or catalytic residues.', 10657849: 'There are conflicting reports on the effect of serum from patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) or normal human serum on beta-cell function and insulin secretion. Here, we report that the sera of newly diagnosed IDDM patients potently suppresses insulin secretion from a clonal rat pancreatic beta-cell line (BRIN-BD11), but do not alter cell viability. Indeed, the viability of the beta-cells was not significantly different between cells cultured in 10% (v/v) IDDM sera, normal human sera, or fetal calf serum after 24, 48 and 72 h. Alanine-stimulated insulin secretion from cells cultured for 24 h in (10% v/v) IDDM patient sera was reduced to 48% of that secreted from cells cultured in (10% v/v) normal human sera. After depletion of the complement components C1q and C3, the inhibition of insulin secretion induced by IDDM patient sera was significantly reversed (no significant difference was observed between cells cultured in complement-depleted IDDM patient sera and cells cultured in normal human sera or complement-depleted normal human sera). The concentration of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) autoantibodies was markedly increased in the sera of six out of nine newly diagnosed IDDM patients in this study, whereas insulin auto-antibodies (IAA) were detected in the sera of three of the nine patients and islet-cell antibodies (ICA) in the sera of five of them. In addition, the concentration of soluble terminal complement complexes (SC5-9) was greater in some of the beta-cell culture media samples after 24 h incubation when the incubation medium was supplemented with IDDM patient sera than when supplementation was with normal human sera.

Gingival overgrowth is one of several oral side-effects of cyclosporin, with a quoted prevalence of between 8% and 100%. There is continued debate over the factors which modify the degree of overgrowth, including individual sensitivity, age, dose of drug, duration of drug therapy and the presence of dental plaque. The exact mechanism of gingival overgrowth is still being debated, but appears to be caused by a combination of the proliferation of fibroblasts within the gingival tissue, an increase in the deposition of collagen and extracellular matrix, and a decrease in phagocytosis with a net gain in gingival tissue mass. A number of treatment options are utilized in the treatment of gingival overgrowth, including CO2 laser surgery, improved oral hygiene, the use of antibiotics such as metronidazole and azithromycin, and surgical intervention. In the clinical application of cyclosporin, there is little correlation between cyclosporin dose, serum trough levels and total exposure to the drug, making it difficult to achieve the desired therapeutic response. These problems were previously further complicated by the variability of absorption of the drug via the gastrointestinal tract. The original cyclosporin formulation, Sandimmune, was replaced by a new formulation, Neoral, which has a more reliable absorption, and gives a closer correlation between trough concentration levels and individual bioavailability. There is a conflict of opinion over whether or not the side-effect profile of Neoral varies from its precursor Sandimmune. It has yet to be seen whether the increased bioavailability of Neoral will result in an increased severity and prevalence of gingival overgrowth. An alternative immunosuppressant drug, tacrolimus, which is a macrolide antibiotic with a different side-effect profile, has emerged as a substitute for cyclosporin in organ transplantation. However, there have been conflicting reports of its side-effects and its capacity to cause gingival overgrowth.', 10440767: 'Experimental and clinical evidence suggests that breast neoplasia appears to be a hormone-dependent process that may also be influenced by dietary factors in many women. Conflicting reports on the relationship between exogenous hormones and the development, progression, and recurrence of breast cancer are critically examined in this report. The absolute breast cancer risk associated with either hormone replacement therapy or oral contraceptive use has not been clearly defined. Data from some large prospective studies have actually documented lower mortality rates for women taking hormone replacement compared with those for women who did not have hormone replacement therapy. In this regard, age, duration of use, and preexisting breast cancer risk factors must be taken into account. Although the results of two major prospective clinical trials addressing the role of timing of surgery within the menstrual cycle are forthcoming, the majority of studies have found no consistent association between timing of surgery and breast cancer survival. Recently reported prospective randomized data showing that selective-estrogen-receptor-modulators can act as effective chemoprevention agents in women at increased risk for breast cancer development are presented.

There are conflicting reports on the ability of bavituximab and other antibodies to recognize PS directly or through beta-2 glycoprotein 1, a serum protein that is not highly conserved across species. Here, we report on the generation and characterization of two fully human antibodies directed against phosphatidylserine. One of these antibodies (PS72) bound specifically to phosphatidylserine and to phosphatidic acid, but did not recognize other closely related phospholipids, while the other antibody (PS41) also bound to cardiolipin. Both PS72 and PS41 stained 8/9 experimental tumor models in vitro, but both antibodies failed to exhibit a preferential tumor accumulation in vivo, as revealed by quantitative biodistribution analysis.

The extent of expression and subcellular localization of the spindle proteins Aurora A, Mad2, and BUBR1 varies considerably in different immunohistochemical (IHC) reports from archival tumor tissues. Given the conflicting reports in the literature about the localization of these proteins, we examined the subcellular localization of Aurora kinase A, Mad2, and BUBR1 in normal and cancerous human tissues by IHC. In normal tissues, Aurora A was mainly localized to the nucleus when monoclonal or purified polyclonal antibodies were used, and Mad2 was localized to the nucleus, whereas BUBR1 was localized to the cytoplasm. In malignant tissues, Aurora A showed additional staining in the cytoplasm in the majority of tumors analyzed. Furthermore, BUBR1 was also localized to both the nucleus and cytoplasm in a significant fraction of tumors. Subcellular localization of Mad2 was similar in normal and malignant tissues. Thus, the validity of some earlier IHC studies of Aurora A, Mad2, and BUBR1 should be reconsidered, indicating that high-quality antibodies and a high-alkaline antigen-retrieval technique are required to achieve optimal results. We conclude that the subcellular localizations of these spindle proteins are different, although they have overlapping biological functions, and that Aurora A and BUBR1 undergo a shift in the subcellular localization during malignant transformation.', 27275336: StringElement('Insulin resistance (IR) is closely associated with diabetes mellitus.

Serum IgA, IgG, and IgM concentrations were determined in a cohort of 958 patients and in a reference population of 581 subjects. Overall, 8.2% of patients with epilepsy and 1.9% of control subjects had low serum IgA concentrations. Low serum IgA levels were measured in 19.1% of patients currently on phenytoin therapy and in 11.9% of patients who had previously been treated with phenytoin, whereas only 3.8% of patients who had never been on phenytoin therapy had low serum IgA. In multivariate analysis low serum IgA concentrations were associated with phenytoin medication and female gender. No differences in serum IgG and IgM concentrations were observed between patients and control subjects. However, in patients with epilepsy, low serum IgG concentrations were associated with concomitant autoimmune diseases, and low IgM levels with older age at the onset of epilepsy, long duration of epilepsy, and autoimmune diseases. In conclusion, the prevalence of low serum IgA concentrations was increased in patients with epilepsy, but serum IgG and IgM concentrations were similar in patients with epilepsy and reference subjects. The low serum IgA concentrations were associated with phenytoin medication. In addition to current phenytoin medication, previous phenytoin therapy also was associated with low serum IgA concentrations. This implies that phenytoin medication may have permanent immunological effects in some patients.', 16453734: 'Derivatives of the yeast 2mu plasmid with the cis-acting locus STB (also called REP3) are stably maintained if two plasmid-encoded proteins are present in trans. There are conflicting reports of both the extent of STB and its possible involvement in plasmid partition or copy number control. We have resolved the controversy by constructing 2micro derivatives with a conditional STB function, and showing that when STB is inactivated plasmids become concentrated in a small fraction of the population although the total number of plasmids remains unaltered. Moreover we show that STB consists of two functionally distinct domains which we call STB-proximal and STB-distal relative to the origin of replication. Although STB-proximal is sufficient for proper partitioning, this function is severely disrupted by active transcription from neighbouring sequences. STB-distal is important to protect STB-proximal and ORI from such transcription, and can be effeciently replaced by a 94-bp terminator fragment in an orientation-dependent manner. We find that STB-distal contains an additional element which depresses transcription from upstream promoters. We also describe the phenomenon of replicaton inhibition which we believe can exlain the anomalous instability of some yeast plasmids.', 3202811: 'Despite its increasing use as an animal model of memory deficit in human dementia, relatively few studies have attempted to assess the memory processes involved in the anticholinergic-induced impairment of passive avoidance retention. In the present experiments, the influence of scopolamine administered prior to or immediately following training on 24-h retention of step-through passive avoidance was studied in NMRI mice. In low doses (0.3-3.0 mg/kg ip) pretraining administration (-5 min) of scopolamine induced a very strong amnesia. Post-training scopolamine induced a significant effect only at the highest dose tested (30 mg/kg). In a retention test of longer than normal duration (600 vs 180 s), which resulted in a more favorable comparison value in the control group, an intermediate post-training dose (10 mg/kg) induced a small effect which approached significance; a finding which may account for conflicting reports in the literature concerning the ability of scopolamine to induce a post-training deficit. The pretraining effect does not appear to have been solely the result of state-dependent learning; scopolamine (3 mg/kg) administered before both the training and test sessions induced a deficit of approximately the same magnitude as that found when administered before training or before testing only. The results indicate that scopolamine can induce a small post-trial effect, presumably through an influence on consolidation processes. The much larger effect of pretrial scopolamine, however, indicates a primary influence on processes related to information acquisition. Together with findings from the literature, the present experiments suggest that scopolamine-induced amnesia partially, but not completely, models the memory deficits of human dementia.', 2390121: 'Suppression of rheumatoid factor (RF) production in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been variably attributed to the use of remittive agents per se or to clinical improvement associated with their use. There have been conflicting reports with regard to the influence of methotrexate (MTX) on serum RF levels in RA. We determined IgM-RF and IgA-RF levels in paired serum samples (obtained at study entry and completion) from RA patients enrolled in multicenter trials with the Cooperative Systematic Studies of Rheumatic Diseases program. After exclusion of the 14 IgM-RF-negative sera, there were samples from 30 MTX-treated patients and 52 placebo-treated patients. Changes in IgM-RF and IgA-RF levels were weakly associated with each other. Significant decreases in IgM-RF levels were observed in the MTX-treated patients, but not in the placebo group. These changes were most significant in the MTX-treated patients who improved clinically. There were significant decreases in IgA-RF levels at study completion among MTX-treated patients who had improved clinically and those who had not improved clinically, but not in the placebo group. The contributions of clinical improvement and MTX treatment to changes in serum IgM-RF and IgA-RF levels were examined using a logistic regression model. Changes in IgM-RF were strongly related to MTX treatment and, to a lesser extent, to clinical improvement; changes in IgA-RF were related only to MTX treatment. These results indicate that MTX treatment per se decreases both IgM-RF and IgA-RF levels, whereas clinical improvement correlates with decreased IgM-RF levels only.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)', 20668524: 'The cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) of the oral pathogen Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in various cell types. Western analysis, pharmacological inhibition and siRNA silencing were performed in human immortalized gingival keratinocytes (HIGK) to dissect the functional role of the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) pathway in the signal transduction steps triggered by the CDT. Infection of HIGK was associated with a time-dependent induction of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragmentation. However, in the absence of CDT, infected HIGK underwent reversible DNA strand breaks but not apoptosis, while caspase 3 activity, p21 levels, and HIGK viability were unaffected. Caspase 9 activity was attenuated in the CDT mutant-infected HIGK compared to wild-type infected cells. Pharmacological inhibition and siRNA-silencing of the ATM downstream effector, the protein kinase checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2), significantly impacted CDT-mediated apoptosis. Together, these findings provide insight on the specificity of the ATM-Chk2 pathway in response to the CDT of A. actinomycetemcomitans in oral epithelial cells, which ultimately leads to apoptosis. We further propose the existence of an unidentified factor that is distinct from the CDT, and involved with a reversible DNA fragmentation that does not trigger terminal apoptosis in oral epithelial cells. This model potentially explains conflicting reports on the biological activity of the A. actinomycetemcomitans CDT.', 28522607: '200, and that these two residues were essential for GAPDH-mediated activation of TNF receptor-associated factor 2 ubiquitination.

However, there are conflicting reports of the sensitivity and specificity of BRAF V600E immunohistochemistry (IHC), and little is known about its reliability in tissues collected from metastatic sites or after chemotherapy, radiation therapy and/or targeted therapy. The degree of intratumoral staining heterogeneity is also not well established. We performed IHC for BRAF V600E (VE1) on 204 cases of colorectal carcinoma including 59 with the BRAF V600E mutation. These included primary (n=147) and metastatic/recurrent (n=57) tumors, collected before (n=133) or after (n=71) chemotherapy, radiation therapy and/or targeted therapy. Evaluation of a test cohort (39 cases) with knowledge of mutation status established a specific staining pattern for the mutation: diffuse cytoplasmic staining of near-uniform intensity, regardless of strength of staining. Using this pattern, pathologists at 3 levels of training independently performed blinded evaluation of the remaining cases. BRAF V600E staining was 96.3% sensitive and 98.5% specific for the mutation, including both pretreatment and posttreatment specimens. Fleiss \\u03ba for interobserver agreement was 0.96. Staining of whole sections of the BRAF mutants showed diffuse staining in all cases and uniform or near-uniform intensity in 91%. In 20 cases with both pretreatment and posttreatment specimens, there was 100% accuracy and agreement in staining between samples.

We also address several of the possible reasons for the previous conflicting reports in studies correlating trauma patients sera TNF-alpha levels to their clinical outcome. These are 1) the lack of an objective quantitative score of clinical illness severity, 2) the lack of multiple TNF-alpha measurements in one patient to allow for trend analysis, 3) the lack of analysis of membrane-associated as well as secreted TNF-alpha levels, 4) the lack of concomitant analysis of soluble TNF-alpha receptors which may bind TNF-alpha in the serum, and 5) the possible requirement for more than one dysfunction in monocyte (M phi) TNF-alpha production and regulation to initiate pathology. Here, the MODS score was used to quantitate patients' illness severity over the length of their intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Patients' and normals' monocytes (stimulated and unstimulated) were assessed for production of secreted as well as membrane-associated TNF-alpha (sTNF and mTNF) and for shed p75 TNF-alpha receptor (TNFR) levels. These parameters of M phi TNF-alpha production and regulation were correlated to the MODS score as an indicator of clinical outcome. There was no correlation between sTNF and MODS score (p = .9025). There was a correlation between increased mTNF (p = .057) or decreased TNFR shedding (p = .0021) to increased MODS, but this lacked specificity. However, when the stimulated M phi production of mTNF and TNFR are expressed as the mTNF/TNFR ratio, an increased ratio correlates with high specificity to development of organ failure (p = .0002). These data indicate that a dual deregulation in M phi TNF-alpha production reflects increasing mTNF-alpha levels concomitant to decreased M phi shedding of neutralizing TNFR and correlates with the development of MODS.\", 9779332: 'Increased parity is more common in lower-socioeconomic groups. Additionally, GMPs tend to be older. It is for these reasons that there is a tendency for an increased incidence of antenatal complications, such as hypertension and diabetes, among GMP mothers. It appears that the previous conflicting reports on the effect of high parity on perinatal outcome can be related to differences in the socioeconomic conditions of the parturient population under examination. Previous evidence of the unfavorable influence on perinatal outcome of high parity might have been biased by patient selection, because high parity is often inversely linked to social class. Our recent studies of the Israeli maternal population plus comparable reports from other countries allow us to conclude that GMP is not always a great cause for concern in an economically stable and healthy population that has access to high-quality medical care.

A common theme across these diseases is that although there is a tendency towards decreased antibody responses after immunisation, there is no conclusive evidence linking these observations to a decrease in clinical protection from infection. There is a clear need for definitive studies of vaccination strategies in IDUs; however, a synthesis of the available published evidence suggests that immunisation does result in effective clinical protection from disease in this population.

In contrast, reports on desensitization of cAMP formation in ESRF patients remain contradictory. Whether this discrepancy results from a difference between human ESRF and its animal models or from the use of circulating blood cells in the human and various solid tissues in the animal studies, remains unclear. Therefore, we performed three studies with heart and platelets of ESRF patients undergoing haemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and age- and gender-matched controls with normal renal function (n = 11-13 each). 2 In platelets from haemodialysis patients adenylyl cyclase activity in response to receptor-dependent and -independent agonists was reduced by approximately 30%, and this could be explained by an alteration at the level of adenylyl cyclase itself. However, no such desensitization was seen in platelets from peritoneal dialysis patients. 3 In hearts from ESRF patients undergoing haemodialysis, beta-adrenoceptor density and subtype distribution, cAMP formation in response to the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline or various receptor-independent stimuli, were very similar to those in control patients but activity of G-protein-coupled receptor kinase was increased by approximately 20%. 4 We conclude that conflicting reports on the desensitization of cAMP formation between ESRF patients and ESRF animal models are not explained by the use of solid tissues in animal studies vs. circulating blood cells in patient studies. Rather desensitization of cAMP formation seems to be a less consistent feature of human ESRF than of its animal models.', 10098833: 'There are conflicting reports of an association of ovarian antibodies, detected by immunofluorescence, with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

In this study, the conditions under which homosynaptic LTD occurs in the CA1 region of freely moving rats was investigated. Three rat strains were studied: Wistar, Sprague-Dawley and Hooded Lister. Whereas Wistar and Sprague-Dawley rats expressed optimal LTD following 1 Hz LFS, Hooded Lister rats showed no LTD when tested in an LFS range of 1-10 Hz. Exposure to marked stress transiently enhanced LTD obtained in Wistar and Sprague-Dawley rats, but did not facilitate LTD induction in the LTD-resistant strain. It was possible to induce long-term potentiation with high-frequency stimulation, although the profile of LTP was different in each strain. These data suggest that the expression of LTD varies according to the strain of rat used and is tightly dependent upon stimulation frequency. In addition the behavioral state of the animal may influence LTD expression.

Analyzing longitudinal carriage data from Israeli toddlers in day care, we found a lower risk of colonization with types 6A, 14, and 23F after previous exposure to the homologous type. Nonsignificant trends suggesting possible protection derived from prior exposure were found for types 19A and 23A. Furthermore, we found that, for types 14 and 23F, this specific protection correlated with increased serotype-specific antibody concentration. We found no evidence of specific protection for type 6B, group 15, or type 19F. Our findings imply that at least some serotypes generate anti-capsular antibodies that can reduce the risk of carriage in unimmunized toddlers.', 11024536: 'The identity of cell types within the central nervous system (CNS) capable of activating T lymphocytes is a fundamental issue in the understanding of multiple sclerosis and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). To become fully activated, a T cell must recognize its antigen and receive co-stimulation, the latter being optimally delivered via B7-1 and/or B7-2 molecules expressed by the antigen presenting cell (APC). There are conflicting reports regarding whether astrocytes or CNS endothelial cells (EC) can act as fully competent APCs. The present studies were performed to determine whether astrocytes or CNS EC express B7-1 or B7-2 immunoreactivity during EAE. No expression of B7-1 or B7-2 by either astrocytes or EC was detected during acute, remitting, relapsing or chronic EAE, whether EAE was induced by active immunization or cell transfer using five different myelin antigens. These results suggest that neither astrocytes nor CNS EC can deliver co-stimulatory signals via B7 molecules in the setting of murine EAE, rendering them incapable of acting as fully competent APCs.', 9218202: 'AIM OF ANTIHYPERTENSIVE TREATMENT IN DIABETICS: Prevention or treatment of hypertensive in diabetic patients reduces the incidence and progression of diabetic complications of retinopathy and nephropathy, cerebro- and cardio-vascular disease, and widespread macroangiopathy. Therefore, in patients with diabetes and hypertension beside good glucose control, the basic and probably major intervention steps is to normalize blood pressure. Antihypertensive treatment usually means life-long use of antihypertensive drugs. METABOLIC EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT DRUG CLASSES: Given the known diabetogenic properties of several antihypertensive drugs and their high rate of use, in probably a substantial proportion of patients with diabetes or prone to develop diabetes, treating arterial hypertension with conventional diuretics and/or beta-blockers might, in the long term, offset the beneficial effects of lowering blood pressure. Furthermore, there are conflicting reports of increased mortality in patients treated with diuretics, beta-blockers or calcium antagonists. Consequently, metabolic aspects and side effects of antihypertensive drugs are key elements in determining the preference for a specific antihypertensive regimen. Although the impact of hyperinsulinemia/insulin resistance on morbidity and mortality is an open question, it is preferable that antihypertensive treatment does not increase insulin resistance and/or hyperinsulinemia. Chronic beta-blocker treatment can be accompanied by an increase in insulin resistance. Calcium antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and alpha(1)-blockers are neutral or might even improve insulin resistance and lipid profile. Thiazides impair glucose tolerance, increase low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and decrease potassium, although these side effects are dose-dependent. Unless diuretics are needed for reasons other than hypertension, treatment of diabetics with thiazides should be avoided until the influence of these agents on prognosis is clarified. If the addition of a diuretic is needed, the metabolically neutral indapamide would seem a reasonable choice. PREFERRED FIRST-LINE TREATMENT: On the basis of favorable pharmacological profiles, ACE inhibitors and certain calcium antagonists have emerged as the preferred first-line drugs in the treatment of the hypertensive diabetic patient. In diabetics with nephropathy, therapy is usually initiated with an ACE inhibitor. Moreover, the combination of an ACE inhibitor and a calcium antagonist that lowers the heart rate (such as verapamil) might offer even greater advantages than either class of drug alone, since they combine metabolic neutrality with added antihypertensive and renal protective efficacy.', 18321434: 'The most appropriate means to diagnose and manage patients with suspected gallbladder dyskinesia remain contentious. A major problem relates to difficulties in clearly identifying the features that characterize biliary-like pain. Conflicting reports in the literature regarding whether symptoms alone are reliable predictors of pain relief after cholecystectomy in patients with suspected gallbladder dysfunction underscore the perceived need by clinicians for a reliable test to help confirm a clinical suspicion of gallbladder dysfunction before cholecystectomy. Most studies report use of cholecystokinin-cholescintigraphy (CCK-CS) with calculation of gallbladder ejection fraction in predicting symptom outcome after cholecystectomy in patients with suspected gallbladder dyskinesia. However, quality evidence is lacking, thereby precluding a definitive recommendation regarding its use. Nevertheless, CCK-CS may be useful when performed using a slow infusion of CCK in a well-selected patient population. Based on our clinical experience and interpretation of the literature, we currently suggest consideration of cholecystectomy to our patients based on high clinical suspicion. This is performed after adequate follow-up with trials of pharmacologic therapies and exclusion of other disease entities and counseling the patient on postoperative expectations. Clearly, a large, prospective, controlled study is needed with patients meeting the Rome definition of gallbladder dyskinesia, randomized to surgery or no surgery, and using standardized CCK-CS methods and outcome measures with long-term follow-up. This study would help us better understand the pathophysiology and optimal management of this clinically challenging condition.', 26849447: 'The Other-Race Effect (ORE) is the robust and well-established finding that people are generally poorer at facial recognition of individuals of another race than of their own race. Over the past four decades, much research has focused on the ORE because understanding this phenomenon is expected to elucidate fundamental face processing mechanisms and the influence of experience on such mechanisms. Several recent studies of the ORE in which the eye-movements of participants viewing own- and other-race faces were tracked have, however, reported highly conflicting results regarding the presence or absence of differential patterns of eye-movements to own- versus other-race faces. This discrepancy, of course, leads to conflicting theoretical interpretations of the perceptual basis for the ORE. Here we investigate fixation patterns to own- versus other-race (African and Chinese) faces for Caucasian participants using different analysis methods. While we detect statistically significant, though subtle, differences in fixation pattern using an Area of Interest (AOI) approach, we fail to detect significant differences when applying a spatial density map approach. Though there were no significant differences in the spatial density maps, the qualitative patterns matched the results from the AOI analyses reflecting how, in certain contexts, Area of Interest (AOI) analyses can be more sensitive in detecting the differential fixation patterns than spatial density analyses, due to spatial pooling of data with AOIs. AOI analyses, however, also come with the limitation of requiring a priori specification. These findings provide evidence that the conflicting reports in the prior literature may be at least partially accounted for by the differences in the statistical sensitivity associated with the different analysis methods employed across studies. Overall, our results suggest that detection of differences in eye-movement patterns can be analysis-dependent and rests on the assumptions inherent in the given analysis.', 29425835: StringElement('Following anterior cruciate ligament injury and subsequent reconstruction transverse plane tibiofemoral rotation becomes underconstrained and overconstrained, respectively.

Anisotropic elastic stiffness and misfit strains lead to the unexpected prediction that low-energy phase boundaries occur along {101} planes, while conflicting reports of phase boundary orientations are resolved by a partial loss of coherency in the [001] direction. Elastic relaxation near surfaces leads to the formation of a striped morphology with a characteristic length scale predicted by the model, yielding an estimate of the interfacial energy. The effects of coherency strain on solubility and galvanostatic discharge are studied with a reaction-limited phase-field model that quantitatively captures the influence of misfit strain, particle size, and temperature on solubility seen in experiments. Coherency strain strongly suppresses phase separation during discharge, which enhances rate capability and extends cycle life.

In a series of experiments, we tested the effect of subliminal and conscious priming of disgust facial expressions on moral dilemmas. \"Trolley-car\"-type scenarios were used, with subjects rating how acceptable they found the utilitarian course of action to be. On average, subliminal priming of disgust facial expressions resulted in higher rates of utilitarian judgments compared to neutral facial expressions. Further, in replication, we found that individual change in moral acceptability ratings due to disgust priming was modulated by individual sensitivity to disgust, revealing a bi-directional function. Our second replication extended this result to show that the function held for both subliminally and consciously presented stimuli. Combined across these experiments, we show a reliable bi-directional function, with presentation of disgust expression primes to individuals with higher disgust sensitivity resulting in more utilitarian judgments (i.e., number-based) and presentations to individuals with lower sensitivity resulting in more deontological judgments (i.e., rules-based). Our results may reconcile previous conflicting reports of disgust modulation of moral judgment by modeling how individual sensitivity to disgust determines the direction and degree of this effect.', 28498098: 'hifollicular state is promoted by a regional and transient diminution of T cell help.', 17680565: 'Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) plays a role in the development of a subgroup of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). However, uncertainty exists about the true impact of HPV in this tumor type as conflicting reports have been published with prevalence rates from 0 to 100%. We aimed to find a detection algorithm of a biologically and thus clinically meaningful infection, applicable for high-throughput screening of frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) specimens. By considering detection of HPV E6 oncogene expression in frozen biopsies as gold standard for a meaningful HPV infection, the value of several assays was evaluated on FFPE tumor specimens and sera of 48 HNSCC patients. The following assays were evaluated on FFPE tissue samples: HPV DNA general primer (GP)5+/6+ PCR, viral load analysis, HPV16 DNA FISH detection, HPV16 E6 mRNA RT-PCR, p16 immunostaining, and on corresponding serum samples detection of antibodies against the HPV16 proteins L1, E6 and E7. Comparing single assays on FFPE tissue samples detection of E6 expression by RT-PCR was superior, but application remains at present limited to HPV16 detection. Most suitable algorithm with 100% sensitivity and specificity appeared p16 immunostaining followed by GP5+/6+ PCR on the p16-positive cases. We show that clinically meaningful viral HPV infections can be more reliably measured in FFPE HNSCC samples in a standard and high throughput manner, paving the way for prognostic and experimental vaccination studies, regarding not only HNSCC, but possibly also cancer types with HPV involvement in subgroups such as penile and anal cancer.', 16572601: 'While there is a significant amount of data showing health benefits of increased fish consumption, there are conflicting reports about the cardiovascular risks of mercury in seafood.

The development of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have been a major advance in that they possess multiple pharmacological effects (pleiotropic effects) resulting in potent reductions of low density lipoproteins (LDL) and prevention of the atherosclerotic process. More recently, the newer fibric acid derivatives have also reduced LDL to levels comparable to those achieved with statins, have reduced triglycerides, and gemfibrozil has been shown to increase high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. Nicotinic acid has been made tolerable with sustained-release formulations, and is still considered an excellent choice in elevating HDL cholesterol and is potentially effective in reducing lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] levels, an emerging risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD). Furthermore, recent studies have reported positive lipid-lowering effects from estrogen and/or progestogen in postmenopausal women but there are still conflicting reports on the use of these agents in dyslipidaemia and in females at risk for CHD. In addition to lowering lipid levels, these antihyperlipidaemic agents may have directly or indirectly targeted thrombogenic, fibrinolytic and atherosclerotic processes which may have been unaccounted for in their overall success in clinical trials. Although LDL cholesterol is still the major target for therapy, it is likely that over the next several years other lipid/lipoprotein and nonlipid parameters will become more generally accepted targets for specific therapeutic interventions. Some important emerging lipid/lipoprotein parameters that have been associated with CHD include elevated triglyceride, oxidised LDL cholesterol and Lp(a) levels, and low HDL levels. The nonlipid parameters include elevated homocysteine and fibrinogen, and decreased endothelial-derived nitric oxide production. Among the new investigational agents are inhibitors of squalene synthetase, acylCoA: cholesterol acyltransferase, cholesteryl ester transfer protein, monocyte-macrophages and LDL cholesterol oxidation. Future applications may include thyromimetic therapy, cholesterol vaccination, somatic gene therapy, and recombinant proteins, in particular, apolipoproteins A-I and E. Non-LDL-related targets such as peroxisome proliferator-activating receptors, matrix metalloproteinases and scavenger receptor class B type I may also have clinical significance in the treatment of atherosclerosis in the near future. Before lipid-lowering therapy, dietary and lifestyle modification is and should be the first therapeutic intervention in the management of dyslipidaemia. Although current recommendations from the US and Europe are slightly different, adherence to these recommendations is essential to lower the risk of atherosclerotic vascular disease, more specifically CHD. New guidelines that are expected in the near future will encompass global opinions from the expert scientific community addressing the issue of target LDL goal (aggressive versus moderate lowering) and the application of therapy for newer emerging CHD risk factors.', 21364933: UnicodeElement(u\"There have been conflicting reports in the literature on association of gene copy number with disease, including CCL3L1 and HIV susceptibility, and \\u03b2-defensins and Crohn's disease.

Clostridium difficile isolates (n\\xa0=\\xa01259) were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to detect binary toxin genes cdtA and cdtB. The PCR binary toxin gene results were compared with clinical severity and outcome data, including 30-day all-cause mortality. The 1259 isolates corresponded to 1083 different patients (October 2010 to September 2011).

The presence of binary toxin correlated moderately with markers of CDI severity (white cell count, serum albumin concentration and serum creatinine concentration).

Alloantisera to DR specificities shared between antigen presenting cells (APC) and T cells displayed a strong inhibitory activity: alloantisera to HLA-DR specificities expressed only by APC or the T cell donor displayed lower or no inhibitory activity. Monoclonal antibodies to monomorphic determinants of HLA-DR molecules were inhibitory, but only when used at a high concentration. Antisera to HLA-ABC molecules and to HSV displayed little if any inhibition.

There have been conflicting reports as to whether the addition of T4 reduces TSH receptor antibodies and improves remission rates more than antithyroid drugs alone. To further examine the effect of drug therapy on serum concentrations of TSH receptor antibodies. 70 patients with Graves' disease were treated with methimazole (Tapazole) alone until they were euthyroid. Then they were randomized to receive either: 1) methimazole alone in a dose sufficient to normalize TSH (0.3-5.4 mIU/L; Group 1); 2) 30 mg methimazole daily plus sufficient T4 (Synthroid) to maintain TSH in the high-normal range (2.0-5.4 mIU/L; Group 2); or 3) 30 mg methimazole daily plus sufficient T4 to suppress TSH to below 0.6 mIU/L (Group 3). The duration of treatment in all groups was 18 months. At baseline and after 6 and 18 months, TSH receptor antibodies were measured both by the ability of patients' sera to stimulate cAMP production by FRTL-5 cells (thyroid-stimulating Ig) and by the ability of patients' sera to inhibit binding of radiolabeled TSH to solubilized porcine thyroid membranes (TSH-binding, inhibiting Ig). Thyroid-stimulating Ig(TSI) and TSH-binding, inhibiting Ig(TBII) concentrations were similar among the three groups at baseline. Mean baseline TSI (expressed as the percent of normal control) for all patients combined was 306 +/- 21%. Mean baseline TBII (expressed as percent inhibition of TSH binding) was 38 +/- 2%. TSI was elevated in 85% and TBII was elevated in 75% of patients at baseline. After 18 months, TSI was elevated in 64% of patients, and TBII was elevated in 28%. Serum TSI decreased by 36 +/- 5% during the study, and there was no significant difference in the degree of reduction among the three groups (P = 0.99). Serum TBII decreased by 59 +/- 3%, and there also was no significant difference among the groups (P = 0.83). At baseline, serum TBII correlated with free T4 (r = 0.33, P < 0.01), total T3 (r = 0.55, P < 0.01), and thyroid size (r = 0.35, P < 0.01). There was no correlation between TSI and any of the baseline parameters or between TSI and TBII at any timepoint. In conclusion, we found that the addition of T4 to methimazole does not result in a greater decrease in TSH receptor antibody concentrations than treatment with methimazole alone.

This strain was isolated on rabbit blood agar from a naturally infected 10-month-old female cat during a recurrent episode of bacteremia. The bacterial species was confirmed by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Nine cats were infected intradermally with 5 x 10(7) CFU of LSU16, and clinical signs, antibody responses, and bacteremia were monitored. All nine cats developed raised, erythematous areas at the site of inoculation within 72 h postinoculation; the swelling peaked at 14 days postinfection and was not palpable by 28 days postinfection. Fever developed in all nine cats between 6 and 16 days postinfection and lasted for 1 to 8 days. Between 6 and 16 days postinfection, all nine cats experienced lethargy which persisted 5 to 18 days. Seven of nine cats were bacteremic by day 7, and all nine cats had become bacteremic by 14 days postinfection. Bacteremia peaked at 14 to 28 days postinfection in all cats. In six of the nine infected cats, bacterial numbers reached nondetectable levels during the 7th week postinfection; however, a single animal maintained bacteremia to 18 weeks postinfection. All nine cats developed strong antibody responses to B. henselae, as determined by Western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

Two hundred and eighty-eight randomly selected age-, sex- and level of education-matched subjects participated, comprising 96 HIV-positive asymptomatic and 96 HIV-positive symptomatic patients and 96 HIV-negative controls. The simple reaction and binary choice reaction time tasks were used for cognitive assessment. The binary choice reaction time indicated that the HIV-positive patients had impaired attention ability and significant psychomotor slowing compared with the controls (P<0.05), but psychomotor slowing was obvious among the symptomatic HIV-positive patients only using the simple reaction time tasks. Significant psychomotor retardation was observed in HIV-positive patients with CD4 levels of 200-499 cells/mm(3) (P=0.02) and <200 cells/mm(3) (P<0.001), and impaired ability for sustained attention was present irrespective of the CD4 level (P<0.001).

Ith administration of fluoxetine (10 micrograms/microliters), one of the presynaptic reuptake inhibitors of 5-HT, produced a marked increase in the mean arterial blood pressure (mABP). This effect could be prevented by a pretreatment with cinanserin (25 micrograms ith) as a blocker of 5-HT receptor. It was further observed that ith of 8-OH-DAPT (2.5, 5, 10 micrograms/10 microliters), a 5-HT1A receptor agonist, produced a dose-dependent increase of mABP and lowering of HR. However, ith of 5-HT3 receptor agonist 2-Methylserotonin (25, 50, 100 micrograms/10 microliters), decreased mABP markedly without change in HR.

Hypoxia (PO(2)= approximately 30 mm Hg) reversibly inhibited Kv1.2 and Kv2.1 currents only at potentials more positive than 30 mV. In contrast, hypoxia did not alter Kv1.5 current. Currents generated by coexpression of Kv2.1 with Kv9.3 alpha subunits were reversibly inhibited by hypoxia in the voltage range of the resting membrane potential (E(M)) of PA VSMCs ( approximately 28% at -40 mV). Coexpression of Kv1.2 and Kv1.5 alpha subunits produced currents that displayed kinetic and pharmacological properties distinct from Kv1.2 and Kv1.5 channels expressed alone. Moreover, hypoxia reversibly inhibited Kv1.2/Kv1.5 current activated at physiologically relevant membrane potentials ( approximately 65% at -40 mV). These results indicate that (1) hypoxia reversibly inhibits Kv1.2 and Kv2.1 but not Kv1.5 homomeric channels, (2) Kv1.2 and 1.5 alpha subunits can assemble to form an O(2)-sensitive heteromeric channel, and (3) only Kv1.2/Kv1.5 and Kv2.1/Kv9.3 heteromeric channels are inhibited by hypoxia in the voltage range of the PA VSMC E(M). Thus, these heteromeric channels are strong candidates for the K(+) channel isoforms initiating hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.', 3803383: 'Numerous conflicting reports describing clinical penicillin tolerant Staphylococcus aureus isolates have raised questions concerning the reproducibility and genetic homogeneity of such isolates. The purpose of our study was to construct a tolerant mutant which would then serve as a reference strain and could also be used for testing the potential significance of antibiotic tolerance during chemotherapy of staphylococcal infections. A penicillin sensitive laboratory mutant strain was mutagenized and exposed to cycles of penicillin selection. A culture was then obtained which lost about 1 log of viability during exposure to up to 1000 times the MIC of penicillin. The same conditions caused a 3-4 log decline in the viability of the parent cell. The tolerance property was stable for at least 150 generations of nonselective growth and was reproducible in randomly picked colonies. The superior survival during treatment was also demonstrable in cultures grown in rabbit serum or cerebrospinal fluid. Penicillin tolerant cultures could also be obtained by selection without mutagenesis, suggesting that such a mutant may indeed be selected for in the clinical environment.', 29282553: u'2). Grip strength (kg) was measured as an indicator of muscle strength. Grip strength showed significantly (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) positive relationships with aBMDs at several skeletal sites after adjusting for ASMI and age (standardized partial regression coefficient (\\u03b2)\\xa0=\\xa00.102 at femoral neck, \\u03b2\\xa0=\\xa00.126 at lumbar spine). Adjusted means of aBMD at the femoral neck and lumbar spine showed significant increasing trends from the lowest to highest tertile of grip strength. Our findings indicate that muscle strength is associated with aBMD at several sites independently of muscle mass in Japanese postmenopausal women. Thus, postmenopausal women with strong muscle strength tend to have a healthy bone status regardless of muscle size.', 15644926: 'Conflicting reports exist regarding the role of porins OmpC and OmpD in infections due to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. This study investigated the role of these porins in bacterial adherence to human macrophages and intestinal epithelial cells. ompC and ompD mutant strains were created by transposon mutagenesis using P22-mediated transduction of Tn10 and Tn5 insertions, respectively, into wild-type strain 14028. Fluorescein-labeled wild-type and mutant bacteria were incubated with host cells at various bacteria to cell ratios for 1 h at 37 degrees C and analyzed by flow cytometry. The mean fluorescence intensity of cells with associated wild-type and mutant bacteria was used to estimate the number of bacteria bound per host cell. Adherence was also measured by fluorescence microscopy. Neither assay showed a significant difference in binding of the ompC mutant and wild-type strains to the human cells. In contrast, the ompD mutant exhibited lowered binding to both cell types. Our findings suggest that OmpD but not OmpC is involved in the recognition of Salmonella serovar Typhimurium by human macrophages and intestinal epithelial cells.', 2564351: 'Fifty-four patients were randomized in a double blind fashion into either a placebo group or a group treated with a 3 mg dose of an intravaginal prostaglandin E2 gel. The group receiving the prostaglandin E2 gel had a mean change in cervical score of 2.7 while the patients in the placebo group had no significant change. Even though a significantly higher number of patients in the prostaglandin group went into spontaneous labor, the incidence of cesarean section was not different between the two groups. Upon comparing the conflicting reports of various studies on the subject, it is concluded that the method of product preparation, particularly the source of prostaglandin E2 utilized and the choice of drug vehicle, may be important variables in determining treatment success, as measured in terms of decreased cesarean section rate.', 24983750: u'There are conflicting reports on the link between the micronutrient selenium and the prevalence of diabetes. To investigate the possibility that selenium acts as a \"double-edged sword\" in diabetes, cDNA microarray profiling and two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry were used to determine changes in mRNA and protein expression in pancreatic and liver tissues of diabetic db/db mice in response to dietary selenate supplementation. Fasting blood glucose levels increased continuously in db/db mice administered placebo (DMCtrl), but decreased gradually in selenate-supplemented db/db mice (DMSe) and approached normal levels after termination of the experiment. Pancreatic islet size was increased in DMSe mice compared with DMCtrl mice, resulting in a clear increase in insulin production and a doubling of plasma insulin concentration. Genes that encode proteins involved in key pancreatic \\u03b2-cell functions, including regulation of \\u03b2-cell proliferation and differentiation and insulin synthesis, were found to be specifically upregulated in DMSe mice. In contrast, apoptosis-associated genes were downregulated, indicating that islet function was protected by selenate treatment. Conversely, liver fat accumulation increased in DMSe mice together with significant upregulation of lipogenic and inflammatory genes. Genes related to detoxification were downregulated and antioxidant enzymatic activity was reduced, indicating an unexpected reduction in antioxidant defense capacity and exacerbation of fatty liver degeneration. Moreover, proteomic analysis of the liver showed differential expression of proteins involved in glucolipid metabolism and the endoplasmic reticulum assembly pathway. Taken together, these results suggest that dietary selenate supplementation in db/db mice decreased hyperglycemia by increasing insulin production and secretion; however, long-term hyperinsulinemia eventually led to reduced antioxidant defense capacity, which exacerbated fatty liver degeneration.', 28381441: u\"Among the LDL receptor (LDLR) family members, the roles of LDLR-related protein (LRP)1 in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), especially late-onset AD, have been the most studied by genetic, neuropathological, and biomarker analyses (clinical studies) or cellular and animal model systems (preclinical studies) over the last 25 years. Although there are some conflicting reports, accumulating evidence from preclinical studies indicates that LRP1 not only regulates the metabolism of amyloid-\\u03b2 peptides (A\\u03b2s) in the brain and periphery, but also maintains brain homeostasis, impairment of which likely contributes to AD development in A\\u03b2-independent manners. Several preclinical studies have also demonstrated an involvement of LRP1 in regulating the pathogenic role of apoE, whose gene is the strongest genetic risk factor for AD. Nonetheless, evidence from clinical studies is not sufficient to conclude how LRP1 contributes to AD development. Thus, despite very promising results from preclinical studies, the role of LRP1 in AD pathogenesis remains to be further clarified. In this review, we discuss the potential mechanisms underlying how LRP1 affects AD pathogenesis through A\\u03b2-dependent and -independent pathways by reviewing both clinical and preclinical studies. We also discuss potential therapeutic strategies for AD by targeting LRP1.\", 3729666: 'There have been conflicting reports on the effects of naloxone hydrochloride in patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT). In addition, none of the naloxone studies in DAT used doses of 2.0 mg/kg or more, the amount necessary to produce reliable cognitive and behavioral changes in young normal subjects. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 12 patients with DAT were administered naloxone hydrochloride in doses of 5 micrograms/kg, 0.1 mg/kg, and 2.0 mg/kg, with detailed evaluation of its behavioral and cognitive effects using measures selected for their potential relevance to DAT and the known effects of blockade of endogenous opiate systems. None of the measures of motor performance, attention, memory, learning, or recognition showed improvement with naloxone. Increased inappropriate verbal productions were noted after 0.1 mg/kg of naloxone hydrochloride. Patients became irritably activated after this dose, which may account for the altered verbal behavior in this study and also for some of the changes suggesting cognitive improvement in prior studies. Differences in the sensitivity and dose dependency of the behavioral effects in patients with DAT compared with prior studies in young normal subjects merit further investigation.', 12794116: 'B cells recognize Ag through their surface IgRs and present it in the context of MHC class II molecules to CD4(+) T cells. Recent evidence indicates that B cells also present exogenous Ags in the context of MHC class I to CD8(+) T cells and thus may play an important role in the modulation of CTL responses. However, in this regard, conflicting reports are available. One group of studies suggests that the interaction between B cells and CD8(+) T cells leads to the activation of the T cells, whereas other studies propose that it induces T cell tolerance. For discerning this dichotomy, we used B cells that were activated with either LPS or anti-Ig plus anti-CD40 Ab, which mimic the T-independent and T-dependent modes of B cell activation, respectively, to provide accessory signals to resting CD8(+) T cells. Our results show that, in comparison with anti-Ig plus anti-CD40 Ab-activated B cells, the LPS-activated B cells (LPS-B) failed to induce significant levels of proliferation, cytokine secretion, and cytotoxic ability of CD8(+) T cells. This hyporesponsiveness of CD8(+) T cells activated with LPS-B was significantly rescued by anti-TGF-beta1 Ab. Moreover, it was found that such hyporesponsive CD8(+) T cells activated with LPS-B had entered a state of anergy. Furthermore, LPS-B expresses a significantly higher level of TGF-beta1 on the surface, which caused the observed hyporesponsiveness of CD8(+) T cells. Therefore, this study, for the first time, provides a novel mechanism of B cell surface TGF-beta1-mediated hyporesponsiveness leading to anergy of CD8(+) T cells.', 27179269: 'The presence of KRAS mutation in colorectal cancer (CRC) is a marker of resistance to anti-EGFR therapy. However, there are conflicting reports concerning intratumoral heterogeneity of KRAS mutations. The aim of this study was to determine whether within primary CRCs with KRAS mutations intratumoral KRAS mutation heterogeneity can be detected between two strictly defined areas, i.e. the luminal (mucosa/submucosa) and peripheral invasive front of the tumor. Using laser-capture microdissection, from every tumor about 400-500 nests of cancer cells were excised from each of the examined areas (luminal and peripheral) and PNAClamp, a high-sensitivity real-time PCR-based diagnostic assay for KRAS mutation testing, was used for molecular analysis. KRAS mutations were detected in codon 12 in both luminal and peripheral regions in all tumors examined. We conclude that from the point of view of practical KRAS mutation testing for predictive purposes in patients with CRC (i.e. testing mutations in codons 12 and 13) sampling errors are unlikely to occur if in CRCs with KRAS mutations only the luminal (as in biopsy tissue) or peripheral region is examined, provided a sensitive system of detection is applied and an appropriate number of tumor cells with minimal contamination by benign cells is analyzed.', 28381446: u'It has been well documented that the transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8) receptor is involved in environmental cold detection. The role that this receptor plays in nociception however, has been somewhat controversial since conflicting reports have shown different neurochemical identities and responsiveness of TRPM8 neurons. In order to functionally characterize cutaneous TRMP8 fibers, we used two ex\\xa0vivo somatosensory recording preparations to functionally characterize TRPM8 neurons that innervate the hairy skin in mice genetically engineered to express GFP from the TRPM8 locus. We found several types of cold-sensitive neurons that innervate the hairy skin of the mouse but the TRPM8-expressing neurons were found to be of two specific populations that responded with rapid firing to cool temperatures. The first group was mechanically insensitive but the other did respond to high threshold mechanical deformation of the skin. None of these fibers were found to contain calcitonin gene-related peptide, transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 or bind isolectin B4. These results taken together with other reports suggest that TRPM8 containing sensory neurons are environmental cooling detectors that may be nociceptive or non-nociceptive depending on the sensitivity of individual fibers to different combinations of stimulus modalities.', 12595465: 'The gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli is the leading cause of urinary tract infection. The interaction between type 1 piliated E. coli and bladder epithelial cells leads to the rapid production of inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8. Conflicting reports have been published in the literature regarding the mechanism by which uroepithelial cells are activated by type 1 piliated E. coli. In particular, the role of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in these responses has been an area of significant debate. Much of the data arguing against LPS-mediated activation of bladder epithelial cells have come from studies using a renal epithelial cell line as an in vitro model of the urinary epithelium. In this report, we analyzed three bladder epithelial cell lines and demonstrated that they all respond to LPS. Furthermore, the LPS responsivity of the cell lines directly correlated with their ability to generate IL-6 after E. coli stimulation. The LPS receptor complex utilized by the bladder epithelial cell lines included CD14 and Toll-like receptors, and signaling involved the activation of NF-kappaB and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Also, reverse transcription-PCR analysis demonstrated that bladder epithelial cells express CD14 mRNA. Thus, the molecular machinery utilized by bladder epithelial cells for the recognition of E. coli is very similar to that described for traditional innate immune cells, such as macrophages. In contrast, the A498 renal epithelial cell line did not express CD14, was hyporesponsive to LPS stimulation, and demonstrated poor IL-6 responses to E. coli.', 15245578: StringElement('The improvement of the quality of the evidence used in treatment decision-making is especially important in the case of patients with complicated disease processes such as HIV/AIDS for which multiple treatment strategies exist with conflicting reports of efficacy.

There are conflicting reports on whether circulating leptin levels change during aging, the possible explanation for which is that alterations in adiposity and body mass index (BMI) also occur. In this study we measured plasma leptin and other hormonal parameters known to influence leptin in 150 men and 320 women of a wide age (18-77 yr) and BMI (18.5-61.1 kg/m2) range. Subjects of each gender were separated into 2 groups of similar BMI, i.e. nonobese (BMI, <30) and obese (BMI, >30), and treated separately. Statistical analysis was performed, treating each group of subjects as a whole population or divided into age groups (<30, 30-50, and >50 yr). BMI-adjusted leptin levels were progressively lower with increasing age in women, with a consistent fall after menopause (-21%; P < 0.001); in men, leptin levels also tended to be lower in subjects more than 50 yr of age, but the reduction was not significant. Multiple linear regression analysis, performed on subjects treated either as a whole population or divided into obese and nonobese, showed that in both genders BMI and age were independent contributors of leptin levels, and there was an inverse relationship between leptin and age in both obese (standardized coefficient beta = -0.25 in women and -0.23 in men; P < 0.01) and nonobese (-0.22 in women and -0.20 in men; P < 0.05) subjects. The correlation of leptin and age with plasma levels of sex and thyroid hormones, GH, insulin-like growth factor I, PRL, and insulin was also evaluated. The variables that correlated with leptin were included in a multiple regression model that included BMI and age. Testosterone in men (-0.43 in nonobese and -0.19 in obese; P < 0.05) and estradiol in women (0.22 in nonobese and 0.24 in obese; P < 0.05) were important contributors to leptin levels; also, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate in obese women (-0.16) and sex hormone-binding globulin in obese subjects of both genders (0.15 in women and 0.19 in men) were significant determinants in the model. However, none of the hormonal parameters abolished the negative correlation between leptin and age or the gender difference in leptin levels. In conclusion, our data show that in adult humans of different body weight, serum leptin gradually declines during aging; leptin reduction is higher in women than in men, but it is independent from BMI and other age-related endocrine changes.', 16550161: 'DNA damage plays a major role in mutagenesis, carcinogenesis and aging. A gene that is emerging as an essential element in the repair of both damaged bases and single-strand breaks (SSB) is XRCC1. XRCC1 has been shown to have a large number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), several of which are being increasingly studied in cancer epidemiology investigations, in part because of their relative high frequency in the population. Although association trends with specific cancer types have occasionally been shown in a variety of ethnic backgrounds, there are often conflicting reports that weaken any substantial conclusions. The functional significance of these SNPs is still largely unknown. XRCC1 is an excellent prototype to provide a forum for determining how epidemiological cancer association studies with DNA repair gene polymorphisms can be validated or refuted. The focus is on the utilization of in silico data and biochemical studies in cell lines and existing mouse models to help provide a framework for the development of new mutant mouse lines that mimic human polymorphisms. These mouse lines will provide the next generation of mammalian tools for carcinogen exposure studies relevant to human cancer and variations in XRCC1, and provide the basis for investigating groups of genes and polymorphisms in an animal model.', 22544658: 'The New York City (NYC) Health Department has implemented a comprehensive tobacco control plan since 2002, and there was a 27% decline in adult smoking prevalence in NYC from 2002 to 2008. There are conflicting reports in the literature on whether residual smoker populations have a larger or smaller share of \"hardcore\" smokers. Changes in daily consumption and daily and nondaily smoking prevalence, common components used to define hardcore smokers, were evaluated in the context of the smoking prevalence decline. Using the NYC Community Health Survey, an annual random digit dial, cross-sectional survey that samples approximately 10,000 adults, the prevalence of current heavy daily, light daily, and nondaily smokers among NYC adults was compared between 2002 and 2008. A five-level categorical cigarettes per day (CPD) variable was also used to compare the population of smokers between the 2 years. From 2002 to 2008, significant declines were seen in the prevalence of daily smoking, heavy daily smoking, and nondaily smoking. Among daily smokers, there is also evidence of population declines in all but the lowest smoking category (one to five CPD). The mean CPD among daily smokers declined significantly, from 14.6 to 12.5. After an overall decline in smoking since 2002, the remaining smokers may be less nicotine dependent, based on changes in daily consumption and daily and nondaily smoking prevalence. These findings suggest the need to increase media and cessation efforts targeted towards lighter smokers.', 19808643: 'Conflicting reports of the prognostic value of HER4 in breast cancer may be explained by distinct activities of the HER4 intracellular domain, 4ICD. Here, immunohistochemical 4ICD staining of archival invasive breast cancers (n = 923) was scored separately for nuclear and cytosolic expression, and these data were tested for associations with clinicopathological markers, disease-free survival, and disease-specific survival. By univariate analysis, cytosolic 4ICD expression was independently associated with estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor expression and tumor cell apoptosis. Nuclear 4ICD inversely correlated with tumor grade and tumor mitosis. In multivariate analyses cytosolic, but not nuclear 4ICD, significantly correlated with disease-free survival (P = 0.035) and disease-specific survival (P < 0.004) in lymph node-negative patients. Our results demonstrate for the first time that cytosolic 4ICD has significant positive prognostic value in node-negative breast cancer patients. At present, tumor grade and size are the primary clinicopathological parameters commonly used to guide decision making in these patients. Our results suggest that cytosolic 4ICD has important pathological functions and may be used to identify node-negative breast cancer patients at low risk of relapse and an improved survival, thereby avoiding systemic overtreatment of these patients. Our results also suggest that pan-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, currently in clinical trials, or HER4 antagonists, which disengage 4ICD signaling, may have untoward activity in patients whose tumors express cytosolic 4ICD.', 27820309: StringElement('The use of intraoperative brain activity monitoring helps to guide the administration of general anesthesia.

An overview of the most frequently used methods to prepare CaP-based coatings was conducted. Dense, homogeneous, highly adherent and biocompatible CaP or hybrid organic/inorganic CaP coatings with tailored properties can be deposited. It has been demonstrated that CaP coatings have a significant effect on the bone regeneration process. In vitro experiments using different cells (e.g. SaOS-2, human mesenchymal stem cells and osteoblast-like cells) have revealed that CaP coatings enhance cellular adhesion, proliferation and differentiation to promote bone regeneration. However, in vivo, the exact mechanism of osteogenesis in response to CaP coatings is unclear; indeed, there are conflicting reports of the effectiveness of CaP coatings, with results ranging from highly effective to no significant or even negative effects. This review therefore highlights progress in CaP coatings for orthopaedic implants and discusses the future research and use of these devices. Currently, an exciting area of research is in bioactive hybrid composite CaP-based coatings containing both inorganic (CaP coating) and organic (collagen, bone morphogenetic proteins, arginylglycylaspartic acid etc.) components with the aim of promoting tissue ingrowth and vascularization. Further investigations are necessary to reveal the relative influences of implant design, surgical procedure, and coating characteristics (thickness, structure, topography, porosity, wettability etc.) on the long-term clinical effects of hybrid CaP coatings. In addition to commercially available plasma spraying, other effective routes for the fabrication of hybrid CaP coatings for clinical use still need to be determined and current progress is discussed.', 21365015: UnicodeElement(u'There have been conflicting reports of the role of Type I interferons (IFN) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

Organically bound Cr supplementation has been suggested to improve glycemia especially in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, but there are conflicting reports on efficacy. Effect of Cr is not clear in prediabetes status. Seventy patients with metabolic syndrome and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), who are observed and treated in the Center of Preventive Cardiology of the University Hospital in Pilsen, were included in the prospective, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled clinical study. Effect of Cr-enriched yeast (200\\xa0\\u03bcg of elementary Cr in the morning and 100\\xa0\\u03bcg in the evening) on glucose, lipid metabolism, fat tissue hormones, oxidative stress, and DNA damage markers was analyzed. There were no significant changes in glucose and lipid parameters, oxidative stress, or other laboratory markers. Only resting heart rate was significantly reduced in patients treated by Cr yeast, reflecting reduced sympathetic activity. This could represent an important cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with high cardiometabolic risk.', 9249928: 'There have been conflicting reports as to whether the mean sperm count in some men has diminished over the last 50 years. The downward trend has been suggested to coincide with an increase in exposure to estrogen-like compounds. These estrogenic substances are ubiquitous in the environment. We have examined the effect of such substances (diethylstilbestrol, beta-estradiol, daidzein, genestein, and nonylphenyl) in the single cell gel electrophoresis assay (Comet assay) in human sperm and compared responses with those from human peripheral lymphocytes in the same donor and in peripheral lymphocytes from a female donor. In addition, effects from the estrogens have been compared to those from known reprotoxins and genotoxins. These include lead sulfate, nitrate and acetate, dibromochloropropane, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, 1,2-epoxybutene, and 1,2,3,4-diepoxybutane. All compounds produced positive responses, but ethylene glycol monoethyl ether only produced positive responses in sperm cells in the male and not in peripheral lymphocytes, and similarly the phytoestrogens (genistein, daidzein) were less responsive in the peripheral lymphocytes in the male than in the sperm. This may be due to greater sensitivity of sperm cells because of their lack of repair. However, since damage was generally seen over a similar dose range, a one-to-one ratio of somatic and germ cell damage was observed and has implications for man for risk assessment purposes.', 19112219: 'Several studies suggest that there is a correlation between dose of dialysis and machine maintenance. However, in spite of the current practice, there are conflicting reports regarding the relationship between dose of dialysis or patient outcome, and machine maintenance. In order to evaluate the impact of hemodialysis machine maintenance on dialysis adequacy Kt/V and session performance, data were processed on 134 patients on 3-times-per-week dialysis regimens by dividing the patients into four groups and also dividing the hemodialysis machines into four groups according to their year of installation. The equilibrated dialysis dose eq Kt/V, urea reduction ratio (URR) and the overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) were calculated in each group to show the effect hemodialysis machine efficiency on the overall session performance. The average working time per machine per month was 270 hours. The cumulative number of hours according to the year of installation was: 26,122 hours for machines installed in 1998; 21,596 hours for machines installed in 1999, 8362 hours for those installed in 2003 and 2486 hours for those installed in 2005.

Since conflicting reports have been published on the capability of HIV to infect EC in vitro, we analyzed some factors potentially capable of influencing the susceptibility of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) to HIV-1. Both primary cultures and differentiated immortalized HUVEC lines were used. HUVEC were negative for the expression of CD4, but weakly CD26- and galactosylceramide-positive. Although binding of HIV to EC was substantial, the virus was apparently incapable of replicating in nonproliferating cultures. In resting cultures, the content of cell-associated HIV disappeared 4-6 days after infection without production of p24 and infectious progency. In contrast, infection of proliferating EC cultures led to the transient release of p24 and infectious virus (10(2.5)-10(3.5) SFU/ml) peaking 2-6 days postinfection. Antibody neutralization of cytokines that may be produced by EC (IL1, IL6, IL8, TNF, IFN-beta) failed to modify virus adsorption and replication, whereas treatment with IL1-beta plus TNF-alpha stimulated both virus binding and virus release. As seen by gag polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the viral genome persisted up to 15 days in untreated EC cultures, but over 20 days in cultures exposed to IL1-beta plus TNF-alpha. This study shows that: (a) CD4-negative HUVEC are capable of binding substantial amounts of HIV-1; (b) binding is enhanced by proinflammatory cytokines; (c) the establishment of productive infection is favored by cell proliferation; and (d) exposure to IL1-beta plus TNF-alpha enhances virus replication.', 1786144: 'Diagnosis of perinatal HIV-1 infection is complicated by the persistence of maternal antibodies and the conflicting reports on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reactivity in children born to HIV-1-seropositive mothers. We have compared PCR with other diagnostic methods for perinatal HIV-1 infection and have attempted also to identify maternal markers which correlate with risk of transmission. PCR was the most sensitive method for early diagnosis of perinatal transmission of HIV-1, but the PCR-positive children (n = 11) developed at least one additional sign of infection. The PCR-negative children (n = 76) were clinically healthy, virus isolation negative, and their serum was HIV-1-antigen-negative. All children who had become seronegative (n = 36) were both PCR- and isolation-negative. Antigenaemia in the mothers correlated significantly with higher risk of perinatal transmission of HIV-1, while no other parameters (clinical stage, lymphocyte subsets, PCR and isolation) showed such a correlation. This indicates that the level of virus expression may be of key importance for the risk of vertical transmission of HIV-1 infection.', 11190068: \"The unfolding of the H. pylori story coupled with the high prevalence and economic burden associated with upper gastrointestinal symptoms makes H. pylori-associated disorders an ideal candidate for economic evaluation. As a result of the high quality and quantity of data emerging, H. pylori eradication is cost-effective in individuals with either newly diagnosed or past PUD. The role of eradication in other areas, for example, patients with nonulcer dyspepsia and screening to prevent gastric cancer, may never be worked out to some clinicians' satisfaction. Conflicting reports and the lack of definitive clinical trials have frustrated clinicians. H. pylori diagnosis and treatment have not been integrated into everyday clinical practice. As a result, the enormous potential benefits associated with H. pylori eradication have not been achieved. Economic evaluation is not a panacea to the problems confronting medical services delivery. Assessments of medical practice are methodologically challenging, time-consuming, and expensive. Once the answers are in, it remains difficult to alter an individual provider's patterns of care and integrate the research findings into everyday practice. Further research into physician decision making is necessary to complement the advances being made in determining the value of medical interventions. The fruits of these efforts will be the more efficient delivery of health care services, which, it is hoped, ultimately will improve the health of patients. There is no reason to believe, however, that more attention to effectiveness research would lead to a reduction in health care expenditures. Increasing demands for accountability of medical interventions will propel effectiveness movements. Economic analyses, performed in concert with carefully designed clinical studies, will spur more critical review of health care resource allocation decisions. Despite the limitations, the findings generated from effectiveness research will have a major impact on physician practices, guideline development, and reimbursement decisions. The tendency of clinicians not to pay attention to economic evaluations may lead to missed clinical benefits and unnecessary expenditures. Physicians who have been reluctant to appreciate the information provided by economic evaluation must understand what other stakeholders in health care delivery already have accepted: that the rational basis for cost-effectiveness analysis is the overall improvement in the quality of health care services--not simply a tool to reduce health care costs.\", 16187688: 'Metabolism, in part, is regulated by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs).

This subgroup of nuclear hormone receptors binds DNA and controls gene expression at the nexus of pathways that regulate lipid and glucose homeostasis, energy storage and expenditure in an organ-specific manner. Recent evidence has demonstrated activation of PPARdelta in the major mass peripheral tissue (ie, adipose and skeletal muscle). It enhances glucose tolerance, insulin-stimulated glucose disposal, lipid catabolism, energy expenditure, cholesterol efflux and oxygen consumption. These effects positively influence the blood-lipid profile. Furthermore, PPARdelta activation produces a predominant type I/slow twitch/oxidative muscle fiber phenotype that leads to increased endurance, insulin sensitivity and resistance to obesity. PPARdelta has rapidly emerged as a potential target in the battle against dyslipidemia, insulin insensitivity, type II diabetes and obesity, with therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of cardiovascular disease risk factors. GW-501516 is currently undergoing phase II safety and efficacy trials in human volunteers for the treatment of dyslipidemia. The outcome of these clinical trials are eagerly awaited against a background of conflicting reports about cancer risks in genetically predisposed animal models. This review focuses on the potential pharmacological utility of selective PPARdelta agonists in the context of risk factors associated with metabolic and cardiovascular disease.', 20705294: 'Knowledge of the transmural stress and stretch fields in esophageal wall is necessary to quantify growth and remodeling, and the response to mechanically based clinical interventions or traumatic injury, but there are currently conflicting reports on this issue and the mechanical properties of intact esophagus have not been rigorously addressed. This paper offers multiaxial data on rabbit esophagus, warranted for proper identification of the 3D mechanical properties. The Fung-type strain-energy function was adopted to model our data for esophagus, taken as a thick-walled (1 or 2-layer) tubular structure subjected to inflation and longitudinal extension. Accurate predictions of the pressure-radius-force data were obtained using the 1-layer model, covering a broad range of extensions; the calculated material parameters indicated that intact wall was equally stiff as mucosa-submucosa, but stiffer than muscle in both principal axes, and tissue was stiffer longitudinally, concurring our histological findings (Stavropoulou et al., Journal of Biomechanics. 42 (2009) 2654-2663). Employing the material parameters of individual layers, with reference to their zero-stress state, a reasonable fit was obtained to the data for intact wall, modeled as a 2-layer tissue. Different from the stress distributions presented hitherto in the esophagus literature, consideration of residual stresses led to less dramatic homogenization of stresses under loading. Comparison of the 1- and 2-layer models of esophagus demonstrated that heterogeneity induced a more uniform distribution of residual stresses in each layer, a discontinuity in circumferential and longitudinal stresses at the interface among layers, and a considerable rise of stresses in mucosa, with a reduction in muscle.', 16193836: 'There are conflicting reports as to whether the degree of angiogenesis as measured by microvessel density (MVD) has a prognostic value in astrocytic tumors. This may be due to the use of different antibodies against endothelial cells to highlight microvessels. It has been reported that unlike pan-endothelial antibodies, such as CD31, anti-CD105 antibodies preferentially react with endothelial cells in angiogenic tissues. To clarify the validity of anti-CD105 antibody in the evaluation of angiogenesis, we assessed MVD using an anti-CD105 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (CD105-MVD) and an anti-CD31 mAb (CD31-MVD) in a series of 50 astrocytic tumors, and correlated MVD with expression of the key angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and prognosis. The mean CD31-MVD and CD105-MVD was 36.7 and 24.8 for low-grade astrocytoma (LGA), 48.0 and 42.7 for anaplastic astrocytoma, 55.3 and 51.9 for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), respectively. CD105-MVD was more closely correlated with VEGF expression than CD31-MVD. Patients with LGA and GBM showing higher CD105-MVD had a significantly shorter mean survival time (MST) than those with lower CD105-MVD tumors (P = 0.0381 and 0.0131, respectively). Whereas the MST of patients with higher CD31-MVD tumors seemed to be shorter than that of lower CD31-MVD patients within each tumor grade, the differences were not statistically significant. These findings suggest that anti-CD105 mAb may be a better marker than anti-CD31 mAb in evaluation of angiogenesis and prediction of prognosis in astrocytic tumors.', 11370798: StringElement('There are conflicting reports regarding the effect of salt sensitivity on the calciuric response to salt, perhaps because of gender differences and different modes of salt administration.

Even so, the literature on the characteristics of the subjects with skin of colour is limited. Several groups over the past decades have attempted to decipher the underlying differences in skin structure and function in different ethnic skin types. However, most of these studies have been of small scale and in some studies interindividual differences in skin quality overwhelm any racial differences. There has been a recent call for more studies to address genetic together with phenotypic differences among different racial groups and in this respect several large-scale studies have been conducted recently. The most obvious ethnic skin difference relates to skin colour which is dominated by the presence of melanin. The photoprotection derived from this polymer influences the rate of the skin aging changes between the different racial groups. However, all racial groups are eventually subjected to the photoaging process. Generally Caucasians have an earlier onset and greater skin wrinkling and sagging signs than other skin types and in general increased pigmentary problems are seen in skin of colour although one large study reported that East Asians living in the U.S.A. had the least pigment spots. Induction of a hyperpigmentary response is thought to be through signaling by the protease-activated receptor-2 which together with its activating protease is increased in the epidermis of subjects with skin of colour. Changes in skin biophysical properties with age demonstrate that the more darkly pigmented subjects retaining younger skin properties compared with the more lightly pigmented groups. However, despite having a more compact stratum corneum (SC) there are conflicting reports on barrier function in these subjects. Nevertheless, upon a chemical or mechanical challenge the SC barrier function is reported to be stronger in subjects with darker skin despite having the reported lowest ceramide levels. One has to remember that barrier function relates to the total architecture of the SC and not just its lipid levels. Asian skin is reported to possess a similar basal transepidermal water loss (TEWL) to Caucasian skin and similar ceramide levels but upon mechanical challenge it has the weakest barrier function. Differences in intercellular cohesion are obviously apparent. In contrast reduced SC natural moisturizing factor levels have been reported compared with Caucasian and African American skin. These differences will contribute to differences in desquamation but few data are available. One recent study has shown reduced epidermal Cathepsin L2 levels in darker skin types which if also occurs in the SC could contribute to the known skin ashing problems these subjects experience. In very general terms as the desquamatory enzymes are extruded with the lamellar granules subjects with lowered SC lipid levels are expected to have lowered desquamatory enzyme levels. Increased pores size, sebum secretion and skin surface microflora occur in Negroid subjects. Equally increased mast cell granule size occurs in these subjects. The frequency of skin sensitivity is quite similar across different racial groups but the stimuli for its induction shows subtle differences. Nevertheless, several studies indicate that Asian skin maybe more sensitive to exogenous chemicals probably due to a thinner SC and higher eccrine gland density. In conclusion, we know more of the biophysical and somatosensory characteristics of ethnic skin types but clearly, there is still more to learn and especially about the inherent underlying biological differences in ethnic skin types.\", 15726917: 'The objective of this study was to assess the acute and chronic effects of estradiol on the myocardial performance index (MPI) in hypertensive postmenopausal women. There are conflicting reports on the effects of estrogen on left ventricular function in postmenopausal women, and we are unaware of any study on the myocardial performance index in the postmenopausal state. We undertook a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 34 women, distributed into an estradiol group or a placebo group. After 90 min and at 12 weeks of administration of 1 mg of oral estradiol we evaluated, by Doppler echocardiography, its effects on the MPI. The estradiol group showed no alteration in the MPI after 90 min of the administration of estradiol. On the other hand, after 12 weeks of treatment we observed a statistically significant decrease of isovolumic relaxation time, from 127+/-23 ms to 106+/-16 ms (p < 0.001 and of the MPI from 0.63+/-0.13 to 0.48+/-0.09 (p < 0.01) and an increase in ejection time, from 297+/-32 ms to 330+/-31 ms (p < 0.01).

Various earlier studies have given conflicting reports on the effect of COX inhibitors on seizures. This study investigates the effect of pretreatment with celecoxib alone, or in combination with phenytoin, on electroshock-induced convulsions. Both percentage protection (i.e., the percentage of animals not showing Tonic Hind Limb Extension [THLE] when a fixed dose of current is administered) and CC50 (i.e., the threshold current inducing THLE in 50%) was determined using a technoconvulsometer. Celecoxib and phenytoin were administered 1 and 2 h, respectively, prior to the experiments. When administered alone, celecoxib showed an increase in percentage protection at increasing doses, with maximum percentage protection (66.6%) occurring at a 30 mg/kg-1 dose. The ED25 value of celecoxib was calculated to be 8.03 mg/kg-1. The CC50 values for the treatment groups were significantly increased compared with the control group (CC50 values for control, celecoxib 10 mg/kg-1, celecoxib 20 mg/kg-1 and celecoxib 30 mg/kg-1, respectively, were 36.3, 49.12, 100.3 and 125.02 mA). An increase in percentage protection was noted when celecoxib 8.03 mg/kg-1 was coadministered with phenytoin 6 mg/kg-1 (66.6% with the combination vs. 16.6% when administered individually). A significant increase was noted in the CC50 value in a combination regimen (CC50 = 79.06) compared with either drug administered alone (CC50 = 49.12 with celecoxib 8.03 mg/kg-1 and 62.06 with phenytoin 6 mg/kg-1). This study may stimulate further interest in the role of COX-2 inhibitors in the modulation of seizure activity.', 24908111: u'Zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), and iron (Fe) are essential trace elements for the growth, development, and maintenance of healthy bones. However, there are conflicting reports as to the relationship between serum level of Zn, Cu, or Fe and osteoporosis (OP). The purpose of the present study is to clarify the relationship between serum Zn, Cu, or Fe and OP using a meta-analysis approach. We searched all articles indexed in PubMed published up to May 2014 concerning the association between serum level of Zn, Cu, or Fe and OP. Eight eligible articles involving 2,188 subjects were identified. Overall, pooled analysis indicated that patients with OP had a lower serum level of Zn, Cu, or Fe than the healthy controls (Zn standardized mean difference (SMD)\\u2009=\\u2009-1.396, 95% confidence interval (CI)\\u2009=\\u2009[-2.129, -0.663]; Cu SMD =\\u2009-0.386, 95% CI =\\u2009[-0.538, -0.234]; Fe SMD =\\u2009-0.22, 95% CI =\\u2009[-0.30, -0.13]). Further subgroup analysis found that geographical location and gender had an influence on the serum level of Zn in OP and healthy controls, but not on the serum level of Cu or Fe. No evidence of publication bias was observed. In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggests that low serum levels of Zn, Cu, and Fe seem to be important risk factors for OP and well-designed studies with adequate control for confounding factors are required in future investigations.', 19822649: 'Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) is a synergohymenotropic toxin (SHT) produced by Staphylococcus aureus.

To determine how the effect of vitamin D might compare to other genetic manipulations that promote adipogenic differentiation, we stably knocked down retinoblastoma expression in MC3T3-E1 cells. Recent studies have suggested retinoblastoma (Rb1) tumor suppressor gene function to be critical to maintain osteoblasts function and inhibit adipocyte differentiation. We exposed MC3T3-E1 cells with reduced Rb1 expression to adipogenic media and found an increase in adipogenic differentiation when compared to cells with a full complement of Rb dosage. However, the extent of the change was not as dramatic as seen with vitamin D. These studies show that preosteoblasts are sensitive and respond to these manipulations that favor the adipocytic phenotype. While vitamin D is not known to directly affect targets in adipogenesis, our observations may have resulted from the malleability of preosteoblast genome in MC3T3-E1 cells, which allowed adipocyte specific gene expression under appropriate stimuli. Why this pathway is influenced and subverted by an anabolic bone factor such as vitamin D remains to be determined.', 29272411: 'Male fruit fly attractants, cue-lure (CL) and methyl eugenol (ME), are important in the monitoring and control of pest fruit fly species. Species respond to CL or ME but not both, and there are conflicting reports on whether combining CL (or its hydroxy analogue raspberry ketone) and ME decreases their attractiveness to different species. Fruit fly monitoring programs expend significant effort using separate CL and ME traps and avoiding lure cross-contamination, and combining the two lures in one trap would create substantial savings. To determine if combining lures has an inhibitory effect on trap catch, CL and ME wicks placed in the same Steiner trap were field tested in comparison to CL alone and ME alone in Australia and Papua New Guinea (PNG). In Australia, 24 out of 27 species trapped were significantly more attracted to CL or ME alone than the combination ME/CL lure, including the pests Bactrocera bryoniae (Tryon), B. frauenfeldi (Schiner), B. kraussi (Hardy), B. neohumeralis (Hardy), B. tryoni (Froggatt) (CL-responsive), and B. musae (Tryon) (ME-responsive). In PNG, 13 out of 16 species trapped were significantly more attracted to CL or ME alone than the ME/CL combination, including the pests B. bryoniae, B. frauenfeldi, B. neohumeralis, B. trivialis (Drew), Zeugodacus cucurbitae (Coquillett) (CL-responsive) and B. dorsalis (Hendel), B. musae, and B. umbrosa (Fabricius) (ME-responsive).

Additionally, data were evaluated on more than one occasion in order to investigate the effect of time upon visual performance with the lenses. The results indicate a measurable decrease in contrast sensitivity for only the highest of the spatial frequencies tested (22.8 c/deg) when soft lenses were worn. For those eyes demonstrating a clinically significantly decrease in contrast sensitivity, responsibility appears to be shared by both the contact lens and the cornea.

Methods In a cross-sectional, self-report study in the third wave of the Medicine in Australia: Balancing Employment and Life survey (2010-11), 16327 medical practitioners were sampled, with 9449 (57.9%) respondents working in clinical practice. Using backward stepwise elimination, parsimonious logistic regression models were developed for exposure to aggression from external (patients, patients' relatives or carers and others) and internal (co-workers) sources in the previous 12 months. Results Overall, greater proportions of female than male clinicians experienced aggression from external (P<0.001) and internal (P<0.01) sources in the previous 12 months. However, when stratified by doctor type, greater proportions of male than female general practitioners (GPs) and GP registrars experienced external aggression (P<0.05), whereas greater proportions of female than male specialists experienced external (P<0.01) and internal (P<0.01) aggression. In logistic regression models, differences were identified in relation to age for males and experience working in medicine for females with external and internal aggression; working in New South Wales (vs Victoria) and internal aggression for females; a poor medical support network and external aggression, and perceived unrealistic patient expectations with internal aggression for males; warning signs in reception and waiting areas with external aggression for males; and optimised patient waiting conditions with external and internal aggression for females. Conclusions Differences in risk and protective factors for exposure to workplace aggression between male and female clinicians, including in relation to state and rural location, need to be considered in the development and implementation of efforts to prevent and minimise workplace aggression in medical practice settings. What is known about the topic? Workplace aggression is prevalent in clinical medical settings, but there are conflicting reports about sex-based differences in the extent of exposure, and little evidence on differences in risk and protective factors for exposure to workplace aggression. What does this paper add? Differences in workplace aggression exposure rates between male and female clinicians are highlighted, including when stratified by doctor type. New evidence is reported on differences and similarities in key personal, professional and work-related factors associated with exposure to external and internal aggression. What are the implications for practitioners? In developing strategies for the prevention and minimisation of workplace aggression, consideration must be given to differences between male and female clinicians, including with regard to personality, age and professional experience, as well as work locations, conditions and settings, as risk or protective factors for exposure to aggression in medical work.\", 1517927: 'Conflicting reports raise a question about decreased plasma clearance (Clp) of theophylline in man during viral infections. Thus a dilemma exists concerning requisite dose adjustments. We examined this issue by retrospectively evaluating theophylline Clp in children infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Two pharmacokinetic approaches were applied to a one-compartment open model to fit theophylline concentrations during 83 hospitalizations of 76 children, 6 to 48 months of age, who received intravenous theophylline therapy and were tested for RSV infection. Iterative linear regression analyses of all theophylline data were used to estimate apparent volume of distribution, elimination rate constant, plasma half-life, and Clp in 39 of the hospitalizations. When insufficient data were available to distinguish apparent volume of distribution and elimination rate constant (n = 44), steady-state estimates of Clp were calculated. An age-matched and percentile body weight-matched cohort design presented RSV as the primary covariate. Theophylline Clp was similar in 29 matched RSV-infected and -uninfected pairs (1.32 +/- 0.14 and 1.25 +/- 0.05 ml/kg per minute, respectively), as were other pharmacokinetic values. Unexpectedly, a significant, inverse linear relationship was found for Clp and percentile body weight. Additionally, children born prematurely and hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit had significantly higher theophylline Clp; this did not affect findings regarding RSV infection. Theophylline Clp was not decreased in RSV-infected children. Current theophylline dosing recommendations for young children infected with RSV should not be altered, but careful monitoring of plasma theophylline levels should be continued.', 8212842: 'Two commercially available immunoassays for the quantitative measurement of antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) were compared. The Amerlite enhanced chemiluminescence assay (ECL), which utilizes capture antigen obtained from HBsAg-positive donors bound to microtitre wells, was compared with the Abbott Laboratories microparticle enzyme immunoassay (IMx), which uses a recombinant antigen coated on to microparticle carriers. A total of 310 specimens, 116 from naturally infected patients (group A), 93 from patients vaccinated with a human plasma-derived vaccine (group B) and 101 patients vaccinated with a recombinant vaccine (group C), were tested in both assays undiluted and diluted 1:11. Samples that showed discordant results were also tested in a conventional quantitative enzyme immunoassay (Sorin). The results show significant differences in the level of anti-HBsAg in patient sera using the two technologies. In general, IMx gave significantly higher values than ECL for all three patient categories tested. These differences may lead to conflicting reports being issued by laboratories who change their assay system or when a sample from one patient is tested by different laboratories using different assays.', 3875901: 'The intracellular deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pools in mammalian cells affect diverse biological functions including the spontaneous or induced mutability. We have isolated from murine T-lymphosarcoma S49 cells, a mutant that is unable to convert dCMP to dUMP, contains deranged intracellular dNTP pools, and exhibits a mutator phenotype. The enzymatic defect in araC-6-1 cells is a deficiency of deoxycytidylate deaminase, which accounts for the high dCTP and low TTP intracellular pools. The addition of increasing concentrations of exogenous thymidine to araC-6-1 cells alters these dNTP pools in a predictable manner: increasing the TTP and diminishing the dCTP. Concomitant with this reversal of the dCTP:TTP ratio is a marked decrease in the mutation rate followed by an increase in the mutation rates at higher exogenous thymidine concentrations. This response of the mutation rate is in contrast to that seen in the control cell line containing normal deoxycytidylate deaminase. In the latter case, increasing thymidine concentration induces an enhanced mutation rate that parallels the later phase of the thymidine-induced mutation rate in araC-6-1 cells. The deficiency of deoxycytidylate deaminase, the endogeneous dNTP pool alterations, and the mutator phenotype of araC-6-1 cells are all recessive traits in cell-cell hybrids. These observations allow one to predict whether exogenous thymidine will be mutagenic, antimutagenic, or both for a given cell line and provide a basis for understanding conflicting reports in the literature concerning the effects of the thymidine on genomic stability.', 14971252: StringElement('Periodontal diseases are infections and thus systemically administered antibiotics are often employed as adjuncts for their control.

Therefore we would like to perform a meta-analysis of previous studies to assess the overall magnitude and significance of the association. Family-based and case-control studies of the association between the COMT gene polymorphism and ADHD were searched systematically and comprehensively. Odds ratios (OR) of association were pooled by the fixed effects model if no significant heterogeneity was present among different studies. Subgroup analysis by gender and ADHD subtypes were also performed. Eleven family-based and two case-control studies were identified. After pooling the results, no significant association between the COMT Vall58/108Met polymorphism and ADHD was found (OR 0.99 (95% CI: 0.88-1.12), P = 0.87). There was also no significant association when the results were stratified by gender or ADHD subtype. There was no significant statistical heterogeneity (chi2 = 12.27, P = 0.2) although clinical heterogeneity was present in the studies, especially the ethnicity of subjects. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated absence of undue influence of any single study. Standard regression analysis showed no significant publication bias.

Although PARP inhibitors sensitize cancer cells to cisplatin, there are conflicting reports in the literature about their efficacy. In order to improve our understanding of the mechanism by which PARP inhibition might potentiate the cell-killing ability of cisplatin, and to shed light on the source of the discrepancy among different laboratories, we have in the present study probed the influence of three PARP inhibitors in four types of cancer cells, cervical (HeLa), testicular (NTera2), pancreatic (BxPC3), and osteosarcoma (U2OS), on the results of Pt-BP6 photo-cross-linking experiments and cytotoxicity assays. We find that the activity of PARP proteins following exposure to platinum-modified DNA results in the dissociation of DNA-bound proteins. PARP inhibitors were able to sensitize some, but not all, of the cell lines to cisplatin. This cell line-dependence and the potential consequences of PARP-initiated protein removal from platinum-DNA lesions are discussed. Control experiments revealed that NTera2 cells are especially sensitive to PARP inhibition.', 19026298: \"Retroperitoneal hemorrhage (RPH) is a potentially catastrophic complication after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Previous studies identified female gender, body surface area, and high arterial puncture location as independent risk factors for RPH. There have been conflicting reports regarding the association with vascular closure devices (VCDs). Chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) and diabetes mellitus have been associated with both peripheral vascular disease and vascular access-site complications. The putative association of VCDs, CRI, and diabetes mellitus with RPH in the contemporary PCI era was investigated. A total of 3,062 consecutive patients undergoing 3,482 PCIs at Brigham and Women's Hospital from January 2005 to April 2007 were evaluated for the study. All 3,311 patients with femoral angiography underwent hand-caliper-based quantitative vascular analysis and were included in this analysis. Multivariate analysis was performed using a backwards selection algorithm, and a propensity adjustment was developed to control for possible confounding variables regarding VCD use. The incidence of RPH was 0.49% (17 of 3,482 patients). After multivariate and propensity analyses, covariates that significantly influenced the risk of RPH were CRI, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, and high arterial puncture (p < or =0.007). VCD use was not independently associated with the development of RPH (p = 0.74). In conclusion, this large prospective cohort study identified CRI, but not VCD use, as an independent predictor for RPH and peripheral vascular disease.\", 10803581: 'There are conflicting reports on the presence or absence of estrogen receptor (ER) in the primate corpus luteum, and the discovery of a second type of estrogen receptor, ERbeta, adds an additional level of complexity. To reevaluate ER expression in the primate luteal tissue, we used semiquantitative RT-PCR based assays and Western blotting to assess ERalpha and beta messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels in corpora lutea (n = 3/stage) obtained from adult female rhesus monkeys at early (days 3-5), mid (days 6-8), mid-late (days 10-12), and late (days 14-16) luteal phase of the natural menstrual cycle. ERalpha mRNA levels did not vary across the stages of the luteal phase, and ERalpha protein was not consistently detected in luteal tissues. However, ERbeta mRNA and protein levels were detectable in early and mid luteal phases and increased (P < 0.05) to peak levels at mid-late luteal phase before declining by late luteal phase. To determine if ERbeta mRNA expression in the corpus luteum is regulated by LH, monkeys received the GnRH antagonist antide either alone or with 3 daily injections of LH to simulate pulsatile LH release. Treatment with antide alone or concomitant LH administration did not alter luteal ERbeta mRNA levels. When monkeys also received the 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor trilostane to reduce luteal progesterone production, luteal ERbeta mRNA levels were 3-fold higher (P < 0.05) than in monkeys receiving antide + LH only. Replacement of progestin activity with R5020 reduced luteal ERbeta mRNA levels to those seen in animals receiving antide + LH. Thus, there is dynamic ERbeta expression in the primate corpus luteum during the menstrual cycle, consistent with a role for estrogen in the regulation of primate luteal function and life span via a receptor (ERbeta)-mediated pathway. Increased ERbeta expression in the progestin-depleted corpus luteum during LH exposure suggests that the relative progestin deprivation experienced by the corpus luteum between LH pulses may enhance luteal sensitivity to estrogens during the late luteal phase of the menstrual cycle.', 17242494: 'Ceramide is involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in skeletal muscles of humans and rodents. However, there are conflicting reports in the literature on the effect of thiazolidinediones (a new class of insulin sensitizing drugs) on skeletal muscle ceramide content. Therefore, the aim of our study was to examine the effect of pioglitazone on the level of ceramide and its metabolites and on the activity of the key enzymes of ceramide metabolism in different skeletal muscle types of the rat. The experiments were carried out on rats fed either a standard chow or a high-fat diet for 21 days. Each group was divided into two subgroups: control and treated with pioglitazone for 14 days. High-fat diet increased the content of ceramide in the soleus and in the red section of the gastrocnemius, but not in the white section of the latter. The activity of neutral Mg(2+)-dependent sphingomyelinase and acid sphingomyelinase was simultaneously reduced in all examined muscles. Administration of pioglitazone decreased ceramide level in the soleus and in the red section of the gastrocnemius in rats fed either diet. This effect could not be attributed to decreased rate of ceramide formation from sphingomyelin or to its augmented deacylation to sphingosine. Pioglitazone treatment reduced the concentration of plasma free fatty acids in rats fed on either diet. Therefore, we conclude that the drug decreased the muscle content of ceramide by reducing its de novo synthesis. The results of our study indicate that reduction in ceramide level may be one of the mechanisms by which pioglitazone improves skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity.', 18609557: 'Immobilization offers several intrinsic advantages over free suspension cultures for the production of monoclonal antibodies. An important advantage of immobilization is the improved specific monoclonal antibody (MAb) productivity (q(MAb)) that can be obtained. However, there are conflicting reports in the literature on the enhancement of the q(MAb) with immobilization. The discrepancies between these reports can be attributed to the different to either the cultivation methods used for immobilized cell or to difference between the cell lines used in the various studies. We show that these differences may be attributed to the different cultivation methods used for one model hybridoma cell line. S3H5/gamma2bA2 hybridoma cells entrapped in different sizes of calcium alginate beads were cultivated in both T- and spinner flasks in order to determine whether cultivation methods (T- and spinner flasks) and bead size influence the q(MAb) Free-suspended cell cultures inoculated with cells recovered from alginate beads were also carried out in order to determine whether changes in the q(Mab) of the entrapped cells are reversible.The cultivation methods was found to influence significantly the q(MAb) of the entrapped cells. When the entrapped cells in 1-mn diameter beads were cultivated in T-flasks, the q(MAb) was not increased by 200% as previously observed in an entrapped cell culture using 1-mm-diameter alginate beads in spinner flasks. The q(MAb) of the entrapped cell was approximately 58% higher than that of the free-suspended cells in a control experiment. Unlike the cultivation method, the bead size in the range of 1- to 3-mm diameter did not significantly influence the q(MAb), regardless of cultivations methods. The changes in q(MAb) of an entrapped cells were reversible. When the free-suspended cells recovered from the T- and spinner flasks were sub-cultured in T- and spinner flasks enhanced q(MAb) of the entrapped cells in both cases decreased to the level of the free-suspended cell in a control experiments. Taken together, these results shows that the method of cultivation of hybridoma cells immobilized in alginate beads determines the extent of enhancement of the q(MAb).', 27832705: u'There are conflicting reports that integration of the wild-type adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2) genome is associated with induction of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a small subset of patients.

Up until recently, macular thickness parameters have not been commonly used in glaucoma due to results of earlier studies with time-domain OCT (TD-OCT) that revealed macular imaging to be inferior to pRNFL in the diagnosis of glaucoma. The recent advent of spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT) has renewed interest in the potential uses of macular imaging in glaucoma due to its ability to better segment and measure individual retinal layers. Multiple studies have been performed in the last few years to investigate the diagnostic ability, reproducibility, and limitations of these new SD-OCT macular parameters. The purpose of this paper is to review the findings of those studies to assess the current utility of macular SD-OCT in glaucoma. Overall, SD-OCT has been shown to have higher reproducibility than TD-OCT, and though there have been some conflicting reports, the majority of studies seem to concur that the diagnostic sensitivity of SD-OCT macular parameters is at least comparable to TD-OCT and other SD-OCT parameters.', 12190089: StringElement('Recent epidemiological studies have reported a threefold increase in the incidence of adenocarcinoma of the lower oesophagus and gastro-oesophageal junction (cardia).

However, there are conflicting reports in the literature regarding its effects on male reproductive function. In this study, it was shown that in adult rats treated with acute doses of bisphenol A, a small but statistically insignificant percentage of seminiferous tubules in the testes displayed signs of germ cell loss, consistent with some earlier reports. It also failed to disrupt the blood-testis barrier in vivo. This is possibly due to the low bioavailability of free bisphenol A in the systemic circulation. However, bisphenol A disrupted the blood-testis barrier when administered to immature 20-day-old rats, consistent with earlier reports concerning the higher susceptibility of immature rats towards bisphenol A. This observation was confirmed using primary Sertoli cells cultured in vitro with established tight junction-permeability barrier that mimicked the blood-testis barrier in vivo. The reversible disruption of Sertoli cell tight junction barrier by bisphenol A was associated with an activation of ERK, and a decline in the levels of selected proteins at the tight junction, basal ectoplasmic specialization, and gap junction at the blood-testis barrier. Studies by dual-labeled immunofluorescence analysis and biotinylation techniques also illustrated declining levels of occludin, connexin 43, and N-cadherin at the cell-cell interface following bisphenol A treatment. In summary, bisphenol A reversibly perturbs the integrity of the blood-testis barrier in Sertoli cells in vitro, which can also serve as a suitable model for studying the dynamics of the blood-testis barrier.', 20447659: StringElement('Although left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are associated with excellent outcomes in patients with end-stage heart failure, there are conflicting reports on posttransplant survival in these patients.

However, mechanisms for the consistently observed CsA-mediated depression of serum testosterone levels are unclear because of conflicting reports concerning circulating gonadotropin levels and incomplete studies of intratesticular steroidogenesis. To elucidate these mechanisms, endocrine-regulated testicular steroidogenesis and heme metabolic parameters were studied in male rats given sc injections of either 25 or 40 mg/kg.day CsA for 6 days and then killed on the seventh day. Consistent with earlier reports, CsA treatment dramatically suppressed serum testosterone levels (less than 20% of control at both CsA doses). Additionally, the intratesticular testosterone content declined with the higher CsA dose. Serum LH and FSH levels were elevated up to 2- to 4-fold after the higher CsA treatment regimen. Measurement of decreases in testicular receptors for LH revealed for the first time that CsA treatment significantly reduced the ability of the testes to respond to normal or elevated circulating levels of LH. In animals receiving higher dose of the drug, cytochrome P-450-dependent mitochondrial cholesterol side-chain cleavage activity, which is the rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis, was markedly reduced to a mere 30% of the control value. Additionally, the activity of the microsomal cytochrome P-450-dependent 17 alpha-hydroxylase was decreased to less than half of the control value. Biotransformation of the prototype drug, benzo(a)pyrene, as well as microsomal cytochrome P450 levels declined significantly after the higher CsA dose, suggesting that CsA has an adverse affect on testicular cytochromes P-450 in general. In addition, CsA treatment altered heme metabolic parameters; significant increases in the activity of uroporphyrinogen-I synthetase and total porphyrin content were noted. Conversely, the activity of ferrochelatase, the enzyme that incorporates iron into porphyrin to form heme molecule, decreased significantly, as did the total heme levels. The latter was reduced to only 61% of control values. The findings suggest the likelihood that the observed inhibition of heme formation may contribute substantially to the reduced levels of microsomal cytochromes P-450 and steroidogenic activities that depend on them. Taken collectively, these data suggest a plausible mechanism by which CsA may induce testicular dysfunction; as the result of a combination of reduction in the number of LH receptors and a suppression of heme formation, the hemoprotein-dependent steroidogenic enzymes activities are compromised, leading to an impairment of normal testicular function.', 12638644: StringElement(\"For the subgroups indicated, a few questions/issues are relevant to all three (women, elderly, minorities): 1.

WOMEN: Stereotypes and myths have prevailed, for example, the long-standing belief that women have poorer prognoses than male alcoholics. When female and male alcoholics are compared, women report more positive family history, a later onset of drinking and problems, more marital disruption, more comorbidity, etc. The review of treatment outcomes (Vannicelli, 1986) showed few significant gender differences in outcomes. Research recommendations include biological and genetic studies, women's view of and use of therapeutic modalities, and outcome studies of different modalities, including all female facilities.

In the moderate social use of alcohol, there are conflicting reports and the extent of elderly use awaits decisive study. The etiology of problem drinking by older persons is studied rarely. An attempt has been made to explain onset later in life (vs. earlier onset) based on the stresses of aging (loss, loneliness, health problems, etc.); research results have not been supportive.

Generalized seizures appear to be most common and occur most frequently in patients with more severe disease as indicated by lower mean CD4(+) cell counts.

First, filipin and nystatin, drugs that specifically disrupt raft function by cholesterol chelation, each impaired entry of C. trachomatis serovar K. In control experiments, filipin did not impair entry of the same organism by an antibody-mediated opsonic process, nor did it impair entry of BSA-coated microspheres.

In contrast, members of the rodent taxonomic order contain two genes in their genomes. These two genes may have arisen in rodents as a consequence of a gene duplication event that occurred during evolution following the branching of rodents from the mammalian phylogenetic tree. In order to investigate the properties of the human AT1 receptor in a pure cell system, the recombinant human AT1 receptor was stably expressed in mouse L cells. An isolated cell line, designated LhAT1-D6, was found to express abundant levels of recombinant receptor [430 +/- 15 fmol/mg] exhibiting high affinity [KD = 0.15 +/- 0.02 nM] for [125I][SAR1, Ile8] angiotensin II (SIA).

Radioligand binding of the expressed receptor was decreased in the presence of the non-hydrolyzable analog of GTP, guanosine 5'-(gamma-thio) triphosphate [GTP gamma S]. Angiotensin II evoked a rapid efflux of 45Ca2+ from LhAT1-D6 cells that was blocked by AT1 receptor specific antagonists. In addition, AII inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in these cells which was blocked by the AT-1 antagonist.

After 8 weeks, there was a modest, but statistically significant reduction in serum total cholesterol in LDLr(-/-) mice repopulated with lyso-bSR-A transgenic cells, due to decreased LDL-cholesterol. The extent of atherosclerosis was reduced in both cross-sectional analysis of the aortic root and en face analysis of the intimal surface of the aortic arch. In addition to changes in atherosclerosis, lyso-bSR-A repopulated LDLr(-/-) mice had a marked increase (3.6x) in spleen weights and a disruption of spleen white pulp formation. Therefore, macrophage-specific overexpression of SR-A resulted in reduced atherosclerosis in two vascular beds, reduced serum cholesterol concentrations, and changed the morphology of the spleen.', 28565991: 'OBJECTIVE Although the use of dual antiplatelet therapy with flow diversion is recommended and commonplace, the testing of platelet inhibition is more controversial. METHODS The authors reviewed the medical literature to establish and describe the physiology of platelet adhesion, the pharmacology of antiplatelet medications, and the mechanisms of the available platelet function tests. Additionally, they present a review of the pertinent neurointerventional and interventional cardiology literature. RESULTS Competing reports in the neurointerventional literature argue for and against the use of routine platelet function testing, with adjustments to the dosage or medications based on the results. The interventional cardiology literature has also wrestled with this dilemma after percutaneous coronary interventions, with conflicting reports of the benefits of platelet function testing. CONCLUSIONS Despite its prevalence, the benefits of platelet function testing prior to flow diversion are unproven. This practice will likely remain controversial until the level of evidence improves through more rigorous testing and reporting.', 11982588: 'Conflicting reports exist regarding the effects of interleukin-10 (IL-10) on mesangial cells. There have been reports of both proliferative and antiproliferative effects, and both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects of IL-10 on mesangial cells. However, the potential for IL-10 to affect glomerulonephritis characterized by mesangial proliferation is not known. To test the hypothesis that IL-10 would limit experimental mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis, IL-10 was administered to rats in which mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis was induced by administration of anti-Thy 1 antibody. Compared to control treated rats, IL-10 treated rats showed less proliferation, with fewer cells in glomeruli. Glomerular cellular proliferation was reduced, assessed by the numbers of cells within glomeruli expressing either proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) or bromodeoxyuridine. Glomerular macrophage influx (but not the proportion of glomerular macrophages that were PCNA positive) was reduced by IL-10 administration. There was no significant reduction in glomerular alpha-smooth muscle actin staining. IL-10 treatment resulted in reduced renal IL-1beta mRNA expression and reduced glomerular ICAM-1 expression, but renal expression of MCP-1 and osteopontin mRNA was unaltered. This study demonstrates that in experimental mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis IL-10 diminishes inflammatory cell recruitment and mesangial cell proliferation. The effects of IL-10 in inhibiting mesangial cell proliferation are likely to be due to a combination of direct effects of IL-10 on mesangial cells and effects mediated by macrophages.', 8899054: StringElement('There are conflicting reports concerning the variation in duration of symptoms relief for patients with hemifacial spasm who have undergone several injections of botulinum A toxin (BOTX-A).

However, the maintenance of some appropriate level of neuromuscular function into old age is critical if we expect the elderly to be able to maintain normal daily activity and functional independence. It is well established that muscular strength declines in old age, but an equally important parameter of neuromuscular function muscular endurance, has received only minimal attention in the literature. Important information regarding age-associated changes in muscular endurance can be obtained from both animal and human research models, each having their own set of limitations and advantages. One problem in trying to interpret past research dealing in this area is the fact that muscular endurance can be expressed in a variety of ways and can be measured by a variety of techniques. It seems that conflicting reports arise from substantial differences in research design, statistical analyses or the ability to control extraneous influences such as physical activity levels and dietary intakes. This review will examine both human and animal literature in an attempt to elucidate methodological concerns in the assessment of muscular endurance and the controversial evidence regarding changes in muscle morphology and muscle metabolism that may be responsible for age-related changes in muscular endurance. Issues that address the possible selective loss of fibre type and the declines in both total fibre number as well as fibre size will be presented, since muscle quantity and quality have obvious links to endurance capacity. In conjunction with the alterations reported in skeletal muscle tissue, muscle blood flow and the relationship between fibre and capillary numbers and their possible influences on substrate availability will also be discussed in relation to muscle endurance capabilities. Finally, the adaptive ability of aged skeletal muscle to improve muscular endurance by different training regimens and through different physiological mechanisms will be investigated.', 10361328: 'BACKGROUND: Mechanisms involved in the development of colon- ic ischaemia are not fully understood and there are conflicting reports regarding predisposing factors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of dopexamine hydrochloride on the incidence of colonic ischaemia following aortic surgery and to correlate immunohistochemical markers of inflammatory activation in its pathogenesis. METHODS: Thirty patients, of mean age 65 (range 46-84) years, undergoing elective infrarenal aortic surgery were randomized to receive a perioperative infusion of either dopexamine 2 &mgr;g kg-1 min-1 (n = 12) or 0.9 per cent saline placebo (n = 18). All patients underwent colonoscopy and biopsy following induction of anaesthesia and at 1 week after operation. Sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin, and for mast cell tryptase (MCT), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and both the inducible (iNOS) and endothelial (eNOS) isoforms of nitric oxide synthase. Sections were analysed blindly and independently by two histopathologists. Patient and operative data were collected and stored separately. RESULTS: Colonic ischaemia was noted in nine patients based on microscopic findings. Endoscopy alone had a sensitivity of 56 per cent. There was a significantly lower incidence of colonic ischaemia in patients receiving dopexamine compared with placebo (P < 0.05). One death resulted from colonic infarction in the placebo group 11 days after operation. There was increased MPO and MCT expression in patients with histological evidence of ischaemia (P < 0.05); iNOS staining within the vascular (P = 0.001) and lamina propria (P < 0.05) components of the mucosa was also significantly greater. No association was found with eNOS. CONCLUSION: Perioperative dopexamine infusion confers a degree of protection to colonic mucosa following aortic surgery, possibly through an anti-inflammatory effect.', 9853425: \"In the medical literature there are frequently conflicting reports on the utility of biological tumour markers available in the clinical management of breast cancer. In this review we analyse current information on the relationships between the most widely investigated breast cancer biological markers including oestrogen and progesterone receptors, p53, Bcl-2, c-erbB-2, cyclin expression, proliferative activity, DNA ploidy and the urokinase plasminogen activation system, as well as their relevance to prognosis and response to clinical treatment. By biological prognostic indicator, we mean a marker that correlates with survival and disease-free survival; the term predictor marker indicates a marker that is capable of predicting tumour sensitivity or resistance to various therapies. Similarly to other authors' experiences, our analysis suggests that oestrogen receptors are weak prognostic indicators and good predictors of response to endocrine therapy. Furthermore, there are consistent data suggesting that proliferation indices are good indicators of prognosis, and that they are directly related to response to chemotherapy and closely related to response to hormonotherapy. On the contrary, there is no evidence or conflicting data for all of the other biological markers. These should be considered in the context of randomized trials in order to precisely define their prognostic and predictive roles. p53 and c-erbB-2 seem to be the most promising factors, but their use in routine practice still needs validation.\", 28324340: 'iparameters and SUV and Patlak slope; the effect of scan time on parameter bias was also evaluated.', 23212541: 'NLRX1 is a member of the Nod-like receptor family of intracellular sensors of microbial- and danger-associated molecular patterns. NLRX1 has a N-terminal mitochondrial addressing sequence that localizes the protein to the mitochondrial matrix. Recently, conflicting reports have been presented with regard to the putative implication of NLRX1 as a negative regulator of MAVS-dependent cytosolic antiviral responses. Here, we generated a new NLRX1 knockout mouse strain and observed that bone marrow-derived macrophages and murine embryonic fibroblasts from NLRX1-deficient mice displayed normal antiviral and inflammatory responses following Sendai virus infection. Importantly, wild type and NLRX1-deficient mice exhibited unaltered antiviral and inflammatory gene expression following intranasal challenge with influenza A virus or i.p. injection of Poly (I:C). Together, our results demonstrate that NLRX1 does not participate in the negative regulation of MAVS-dependent antiviral responses.', 1389055: 'Conflicting reports exist regarding the influence of hyperbaric oxygen therapy on random skin flap survival. The present investigation sought to demonstrate enhanced survival of experimental random skin flaps in swine using an intensive and tapering hyperbaric oxygen therapy regimen that would have direct application in human clinical trials. Random cutaneous flaps were surgically constructed on 12 domestic pigs. Flaps were designed to obtain a predictable length of necrosis. Six pigs did not undergo hyperbaric oxygen therapy and served as surgical controls. Six pigs were subjected to an intensive tapering hyperbaric regimen within 1.5 hours of completing the surgical procedure. Treatments were administered in a research hyperbaric vessel at a depth of 2.0 atm absolute (10 m of seawater) for 90 minutes of oxygen treatment in a tapering schedule over 6 days. This was structured to provide intensive therapy initially during the period of maximum tissue trauma and ischemia. Extent of flap necrosis was assessed by tracing clear plastic templates at necropsy, then converting to square centimeters using a computer digitizer tablet. The difference in flap necrosis between groups was significant, with random flaps subjected to hyperbaric oxygen therapy demonstrating a mean 35% less necrosis than surgical controls. Skin flaps treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy demonstrated a mean survival of 77%, with a range of 56% to 100%. This reflected a 12% improvement in mean surviving area for hyperbaric oxygen therapy flaps over untreated surgical controls. We are unaware of similar studies reporting a comparable degree of enhancement in random skin flap survival using hyperbaric oxygen therapy alone. Adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen therapy in an intensive tapering schedule significantly improved flap survival in this model. Further investigations need to determine the optimum frequency of treatments and depth necessary to attain maximum tissue viability.', 25997831: u'The Jumonji domain-containing protein 6 (Jmjd6) is a member of the superfamily of non-haem iron(II) and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG)-dependent oxygenases; it plays an important developmental role in higher animals. Jmjd6 was initially assigned a role as the phosphatidylserine receptor responsible for engulfment of apoptotic cells but this now seems unlikely. Jmjd6 has been shown to be a nuclear localized protein with a JmjC domain comprising a distorted double-stranded \\u03b2-helical structure characteristic of the 2OG-dependent oxygenases. Jmjd6 was subsequently assigned a role in catalysing N-methyl-arginine residue demethylation on the N-terminus of the human histones H3 and H4; however, this function is also subject to conflicting reports. Jmjd6 does catalyse 2OG-dependent C-5 hydroxylation of lysine residues in mRNA splicing-regulatory proteins and histones; there is also accumulating evidence that Jmjd6 plays a role in splicing (potentially in an iron- and oxygen-dependent manner) as well as in other processes regulating gene expression, including transcriptional pause release. Moreover, a link with tumour progression has been suggested. In the present review we look at biochemical, structural and cellular work on Jmjd6, highlighting areas of controversy and consensus.', 29594121: 'granulosusprobably secretes molecules that can be developed as anticancer therapeutics in future.', 22729227: 'Although several clinical studies show a gender dimorphism of immune and organ responsiveness in the susceptibility to and morbidity from shock, trauma, and sepsis, there are conflicting reports on the role of gender in outcomes. In contrast, results obtained from experimental studies clearly support the suggestion that gender plays a significant role in post-injury pathogenesis. Studies performed in a rodent model of trauma-hemorrhage have confirmed that alterations in immune and organ functions after trauma-hemorrhage are more markedly depressed in adult males and in ovariectomized and aged females; however, both are maintained in castrated males and in proestrus females. Moreover, the survival rate of proestrus females subjected to sepsis after trauma-hemorrhage is significantly higher than in age-matched males or ovariectomized females. In this respect, organ functions and immune responses are depressed in males with sepsis or trauma, whereas they are unchanged or are enhanced in females. This article reviews studies delineating the mechanism by which estrogen regulates cerebral nervous, lung, and heart systems in an experimental model of sepsis, trauma, or reperfusion injury.', 22729228: 'Several clinical studies show a gender dimorphism of immune and organ responsiveness in the susceptibility to and morbidity from shock, trauma, and sepsis.

In this review, we discuss the effect of estrogen on liver, intestinal, splenic, and renal functions in an experimental model of sepsis, trauma, and reperfusion injury. To establish the role of gender in the outcome of these patients, more studies in clinical and experimental settings are required to determine whether gender-specific responses are global across the injuries or are observed in specific injury situations. Studies are also needed to delineate underlying mechanisms responsible for differences between males and females.

We used MEDLINE to perform a systematic literature review of peer-reviewed, English-language literature published between 1995 and 2010. Widely variable frequency data were reported. Clinical presentation of influenza B was similar to that of influenza A, although we observed conflicting reports. Influenza B-specific data on hospitalization rates, length of stay, and economic outcomes were limited but demonstrated that the burden of influenza B can be significant. The medical literature demonstrates that influenza B can pose a significant burden to the global population. The comprehensiveness and quality of reporting on influenza B, however, could be substantially improved. Few articles described complications. Additional data regarding the incidence, clinical burden, and economic impact of influenza B would augment our understanding of the disease and assist in vaccine development.', 8317460: 'The treatment of corticosteroid- and/or splenectomy-refractory immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) includes vinca alkaloids, immunosuppressives, Danazol, intravenous gammaglobulin, and alpha-interferon. However, these treatments have often been associated with toxic side effects. Brox et al. (Br J Haematol 70:341-344, 1988) reported the efficacy of ascorbic acid in the treatment of ITP; the platelet count normalized in seven of 11 patients studied, and tolerance was excellent. However, other investigators have reported less impressive results. These conflicting reports prompted a pilot study of ascorbic acid in 12 patients with refractory ITP. Patients were given 2 g every morning for at least 10 weeks. All have received glucocorticoids, three had undergone splenectomy, and six received other treatments. The maximal increase in platelet count above baseline (i.e., the prestudy platelet count) achieved was < 20,000 in 11 patients and 25,000 in one patient. Therapy was well tolerated, with only two patients complaining of dyspepsia.

Thirty-six asplenic patients and 15 healthy controls were immunized with pneumococcal, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), and meningococcal vaccines. Antibody concentrations to Hib and pneumococcal serotypes 14 and 18C were measured by ELISA. IgG antibody responses to all three antigens were similar in asplenic patients and controls at 28 days following immunization. In contrast, asplenic patients had significantly lower IgM concentrations in response to Hib (P<.05) and to both pneumococcal serotypes 14 (P<. 005) and 18C (P<.001). IgA anti-Hib antibody was also lower in the asplenic group, as was total anti-Hib antibody measured by RIA. These results document that IgG responses to polysaccharide vaccines are normal in asplenic patients. The impaired IgM responses of these patients may explain conflicting reports from studies that measured only total antibody-binding concentrations.', 27640347: 'Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) comprise 6-8% of the human genome. HERVs are silenced in most normal tissues, up-regulated in stem cells and in placenta but also in cancer and HIV-1 infection. Crucially, there are conflicting reports on detecting HERV RNA in non-cellular clinical samples such as plasma that suggest the study of HERV RNA can be daunting. Indeed, we find that the use of real-time PCR in a quality assured clinical laboratory setting can be sensitive to low-level proviral contamination. We developed a mathematical model for low-level contamination that allowed us to design a laboratory protocol and standard operating procedures for robust measurement of HERV RNA. We focus on one family, HERV-K HML-2 (HK2) that has been most recently active even though they invaded our ancestral genomes almost 30 millions ago. We extensively validated our experimental design on a model cell culture system showing high sensitivity and specificity, totally eliminating the proviral contamination. We then tested 236 plasma samples from patients infected with HIV-1, HCV or HBV and found them to be negative. The study of HERV RNA for human translational studies should be performed with extensively validated protocols and standard operating procedures to control the widespread low-level human DNA contamination.', 23208478: StringElement('There has been conflicting reports of the level of hazardous alcohol use among doctors despite the significant occurrences in the general population.

This study attempted to resolve the conflicting reports by investigating experimental variables that could impact Erk1/2 activation using a high through-put assay that quantitatively assessed Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Variables tested included: cell staging and dosing regimes with and without charcoal-stripped serum, different MCF-7 cell sublines and culture densities and several E2 formulations and solvents. Levels of phosphorylated Erk1/2 were normalized to cellular protein rather than to total Erk1/2 protein because an antibody purported to recognize total Erk1/2 preferentially reacted with non-phosphorylated Erk1/2, potentially exaggerating the apparent level of Erk1/2 activation. Dosing MCF-7 cells with E2 containing small amounts of stripped serum induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation; however, this induction was largely attributed to serum factors. E2 administered in serum-free medium did not significantly alter Erk1/2 phosphorylation under any condition tested; immunocytochemistry corroborated this conclusion. While phosphatase inhibitors generally increased Erk1/2 phosphorylation, they did not impact E2-altered Erk1/2 phosphorylation.

Foremost amongst these are factors relating to variation in postmortem interval (PMI). Currently there are conflicting reports on how PMI affects overall RNA integrity, and very few reports of how gene expression is affected by PMI. We analyzed total RNA extracted from frozen cerebellar cortex from 79 deceased human subjects enrolled in the Banner Sun Health Research Institute Brain and Body Donation Program. The PMI, which ranged from 1.5 to 45\\xa0h, correlated with overall RNA quality measures including RNA Integrity Number (RIN) (r\\xa0=\\xa0-0.34, P\\xa0=\\xa00.002) and RNA quantitative yield (r\\xa0=\\xa0-0.25, P\\xa0=\\xa00.02).

With phenobarbital, there is a high risk for serious cognitive effects impacting attention and memory. Phenytoin may affect mental speed, mainly in higher dosing and polytherapy. Moderate monotherapy doses do not seem to induce much effect. Valproate does not seem to impair cognition if sufficiently controlled for hyperammonemia.

This article discusses the general use of herbal medicines in the management of several ailments, their concurrent use with conventional therapy, mechanisms underlying herb-drug interactions (HDIs) as well as the drawbacks of herbal remedy use. The authors also suggest means of surveillance and safety monitoring of herbal medicines. Contrary to popular belief that \"herbal medicines are totally safe,\" we are of the view that they are capable of causing significant toxic effects and altered pharmaceutical outcomes when coadministered with conventional medicines. Due to the paucity of information as well as sometimes conflicting reports on HDIs, much more research in this field is needed. The authors further suggest the need to standardize and better regulate herbal medicines in order to ensure their safety and efficacy when used alone or in combination with conventional drugs.', 16822861: 'In DT40 B lymphocytes, Canonical Transient Receptor Potential 7 (TRPC7) functions as a diacylglycerol-activated non-selective cation channel. However, previous work indicated that the non-store-operated Ca2+ entry in this cell type depends upon inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP3R). With the cell-attached configuration oleyl-acetyl-glycerol (OAG) induced single channel activity (75 pS) that was not observed in TRPC7-/- cells but was rescued by expression of TRPC7 under conditions expected to produce relatively low levels of expression ((LowT7)TRPC7-/-). A DT40 cell line lacking IP3R(IP3R-/- cells) showed no OAG-induced single channel activity, but this activity was rescued by transient expression of an IP3R((IP3R)IP3R-/-). Single channel properties in (LowT7)TRPC7-/- or (IP3R)IP3R-/- DT40 cells were indistinguishable from one another and from wild-type cells. Thus, TRPC7 forms, or is part of, the channel underlying endogenous diacylglycerol-activated currents in DT40 B lymphocytes, and this activity of native TRPC7 requires IP3R. However, with conditions expected to produce greater expression levels, TRPC7 functioned independently of the presence of IP3R. This finding may serve to resolve previously conflicting reports from expression studies of TRPC channels.', 15237710: 'Simple childhood obesity is characterized by normal or even accelerated growth in spite of reduced growth hormone (GH) secretion. There are conflicting reports on the effects of obesity upon components of the GH-insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I)-IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) system. In the present study we aimed to determine GH, IGF-I, IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-2 as well as some of the less explored components of this axis (IGFBP-3 proteolytic activity, IGFBP-3 plasma fragments, and total acid labile subunit [ALS]) in 22 obese and 17 age-matched control children. We also evaluated not only total GH binding protein (GHBP) serum levels but also GHBP bound to GH (complexed) in both groups. Obese and control groups strongly differed in BMI (obese: 4.7 +/- 0.36 vs control: 0.37 +/- 0.25 SDS, p <0.0001). In the obese group, we found lower GH serum levels, but normal serum levels of GH-GHBP complex, IGF-I, IGFBP-3, IGF-I/IGFBP-3 molar ratio, IGFBP-3 proteolytic activity, IGFBP-3 plasma fragments and total ALS. Obese children presented higher total circulating GHBP (6.0 +/- 0.44 vs 2.9 +/- 0.29 nmol/l, p <0.001) and insulin levels (10.5 +/- 1.5 vs 5.1 +/- 0.8 mU/l, p <0.001), while IGFBP-2 (4.6 +/- 0.5 vs 6.6 +/- 0.7%, p <0.05) and the ratio IGFBP-2/IGF-I (0.032 +/- 0.019 vs 0.095 +/- 0.01, p = 0.013) were lower than in controls. BMI and insulin were directly, and IGFBP-2 serum levels inversely, correlated to total GHBP serum levels when multiple regression analysis was performed (r = 0.74, p <0.001). By stepwise regression analysis, insulin (r = -0.37, p <0.05) and BMI (r = -0.52, p <0.01) inversely determined IGFBP-2. In summary, obese children present normal growth in spite of reduced GH secretion, probably because the combination of increased total GHBP and normal GH-GHBP complex serum levels (suggesting increased GH receptor [GHR] number and a normal serum GH reservoir, respectively) allow for the achievement of normal levels of IGF-I, IGFBP-3, IGFBP-3 proteolytic activity, IGFBP-3 plasma fragments and total ALS. Reduced IGFBP-2 serum levels and a lower ratio of IGFBP-2/IGF-I in obese children may suggest an increase of tissue IGF-I bioavailability, thus promoting its action. Normal IGF-I and GH availability may be contributing to maintain normal growth in obese children.', 9417296: 'There is an ever growing report of data supporting the evidence that accumulated genetic changes underlie the development of neoplasia. The paradigma of this multistep process is colon cancer were cancer onset is associated, over decades, with at least seven genetic events. The number of genetic alterations increases moving from adenomatous lesions to colon cancer and, although the genetic alterations occur according to a preferred sequence, the total accumulation of changes rather than their sequential order is responsible of tumor biological behavior. It is noteworthy that, at least for this neoplasia, carcinogenesis appears to arise as a result of the mutational activation of oncogenes coupled with the mutational inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. In some cases mutant suppressor genes appear to exert a phenotypic effect even when present in the heterozygous state thus been non \"recessive\" at the cellular level. The general features of this model may apply also to renal cell cancer (RCC) and prostate cancer (CaP). Extensive literature exists on the cytogenetic and molecular findings in RCC. Only 2% of RCC are familiar, but molecular genetic studies of these cancers have provided important informations on RCC pathogenesis. As with other cancers, familiar RCC is characterized by an early age of onset and frequent multicentricity. A pathological classification useful in studying these patients subdivide renal cancers in papillary (pRCC) and non papillary (RCC) neoplasms. The most common cause of inherited RCC is the Von Hippel Lindau disease (VHL) a dominantly inherited multisystem disorder characterized by retinal and cerebellar hemangioblastomas, pheochromocytomas, pancreatic cysts and RCC. Over 70% of these patients will develop an RCC by their sixth decade. In 1993 the isolation of the tumor suppressor gene in VHL disease at the level of chromosome 3p25-p26 have lead to a better understanding of RCC. Most missense mutations are associated with high risk of RCC, but some are associated with high risk of pheochromocytoma and low risk of RCC. The VHL gene is evolutionary conserved and encodes for a specific protein (pVHL). VHL protein downregulates transcriptional elongation and so suppresses the expression of proto-oncogenes and growth factors. Recently reintroduction of wild-type, non mutant, VHL gene into VHL deficient RCC cell line 786-O had no demonstrable effect on their in vitro growth but inhibited their ability to form tumors in nude mice. So far, VHL mutations or hypermethylations have been found in 76% of sporadic RCC. On the contrary, up to now, no 3p allele loss or VHL mutations have been detected in pRCC. Preliminary studies in familiar pRCC are pointing on genetic changes on chromosomes 1, 7, 16 and 17. As far as prostate cancer is regarded, men with a family history of prostate cancer have an age dependent, significantly increased PCa risk. For familiar clustering, of PCa the two main factors are early age at onset of the disease and the number of multiple affected family members. Hereditary prostate cancer is a subset of familiar prostate cancer with a pattern of distribution consistent with Mendelian inheritance. Hereditary prostate cancer is clinically defined as a clustering of 3 or more relatives within any nuclear family; or the occurrence of prostate cancer in each of 3 generations in either the probands paternal or maternal lineage; or a cluster of 2 relatives affected within 55 years of age or less. Therefore, hereditary prostate cancer may be seen as a multistep carcinogenesis, and clustering may be explained by Mendelian inheritance of a rare (frequency in population 0.36%) dominant, highly penetrant, allele. The estimated cumulative risk of developing PCa, is 88% for carriers as compared with 5% for non carriers. There are conflicting reports of an associated increased incidence of breast cancer in female relatives of men with familiar prostate cancer. In conclusion, there is a clear associatio', 25309778: 'Thyroid cancer is increasing all over the world. The exact cause of this increase is still debated and there are conflicting reports. Sophisticated molecular studies suggest that environmental chemicals may have effects of thyroid carcinogenesis. The development of powerful molecular biology techniques has enabled targeted next-generation sequencing for detection of mutations in thyroid cancer, and this technique can make a specific diagnosis of thyroid cancer in cytologically indeterminate cases. The initial treatment of well-differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is surgery followed by radioiodine remnant ablation. However, further studies are needed to determine the optimal dosage of radioactive iodine for DTC patients with lateral neck metastasis. DTC is an indolent tumor and may cause death even decades later. Thus, long-term follow-up is mandatory. Recently, dynamic risk stratification (DRS) has begun to use stimulated thyroglobulin level at 1 year after the initial treatment and restratified the risk in accordance with the response to the initial treatment. This DRS strategy accurately predicts disease free survival and can be widely used in daily clinical settings. For the iodine refractory metastatic disease, redifferentiation therapy and targeted therapy are two promising alternative treatments. Sorafenib is the first approved agent for the treatment of progressive iodine refractory advanced thyroid cancer in Korea and may be very helpful for radioactive-refractory locally advanced or metastatic DTC. Selumetinib may be an effective redifferentiating agent and could be used within several years.', 25537107: \"Seizures are a known adverse effect of clozapine therapy. The literature varies on incidence rates of seizures, secondary to varying time frames in which each seizure occurred. Tonic-clonic seizures comprise the majority of seizures experienced secondary to clozapine use, but it is imperative to recognize the potential variety of seizure presentation. The exact etiology of clozapine-induced seizure is unknown. Conflicting reports regarding total oral dose, serum concentration, dose titration, and concomitant medications make it difficult to identify a single cause contributing to seizure risk. Following seizure occurrence, it may be in the best interests of the patient to continue clozapine treatment. In this clinical situation, the use of an antiepileptic drug (AED) for seizure prophylaxis may be required. The AED of choice appears to be valproate, but several successful case reports also support the use of lamotrigine, gabapentin and topiramate. Well-designed clinical trials regarding clozapine seizure prophylaxis are lacking. Given clozapine's strong evidence for efficacy in the treatment of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, every attempt to manage side effects, including seizure, should be implemented to allow for therapeutic continuation.\", 8997461: StringElement('To evaluate the efficacy and safety of mexiletine in the symptomatic treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN).', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'OBJECTIVE', u'Label': u'OBJECTIVE'}), 17293913: 'Nitric oxide (NO) is thought to be an important mediator and critical signaling molecule for malaria immunopathology; it is also a target for therapy and for vaccine. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is synthesized by a number of cell types under inflammatory conditions. The most relevant known triggers for its expression are endotoxins and cytokines. To date, there have been conflicting reports concerning the clinical significance of NO in malaria. Some researchers have proposed that NO contributes to the development of severe and complicated malaria, while others have argued that NO has a protective role. Infection with parasites resistant to the microbicidal action of NO may result in high levels of NO being generated, which could then damage the host, instead of controlling parasitemia. Consequently, the host-parasite interaction is a determining factor for whether the parasite is capable of stimulating NO production; the role of NO in resistance to malaria appears to be strain specific. It is known that NO and/or its related molecules are involved in malaria, but their involvement is not independent of other immune events. NO is an important, but possibly not an essential contributor to the control of acute-phase malaria infection. The protective immune responses against malaria parasite are multifactorial; however, they necessarily involve final effector molecules, including NO, iNOS and RNI.', 12364387: 'Increased diastolic SR Ca2+ leak (J(leak)) could depress contractility in heart failure, but there are conflicting reports regarding the J(leak) magnitude even in normal, intact myocytes. We have developed a novel approach to measure SR Ca2+ leak in intact, isolated ventricular myocytes. After stimulation, myocytes were exposed to 0 Na+, 0 Ca2+ solution +/-1 mmol/L tetracaine (to block resting leak). Total cell [Ca2+] does not change under these conditions with Na+-Ca2+ exchange inhibited. Resting [Ca2+]i declined 25% after tetracaine addition (126+/-6 versus 94+/-6 nmol/L; P<0.05). At the same time, SR [Ca2+] ([Ca2+](SRT)) increased 20% (93+/-8 versus 108+/-6 micromol/L). From this Ca2+ shift, we calculate J(leak) to be 12 micromol/L per second or 30% of the SR diastolic efflux. The remaining 70% is SR pump unidirectional reverse flux (backflux). The sum of these Ca2+ effluxes is counterbalanced by unidirectional forward Ca2+ pump flux. J(leak) also increased nonlinearly with [Ca2+](SRT) with a steeper increase at higher load. We conclude that J(leak) is 4 to 15 micromol/L cytosol per second at physiological [Ca2+](SRT). The data suggest that the leak is steeply [Ca2+](SRT)-dependent, perhaps because of increased [Ca2+]i sensitivity of the ryanodine receptor at higher [Ca2+](SRT). Key factors that determine [Ca2+](SRT) in intact ventricular myocytes include (1) the thermodynamically limited Ca2+ gradient that the SR can develop (which depends on forward flux and backflux through the SR Ca2+ ATPase) and (2) diastolic SR Ca2+ leak (ryanodine receptor mediated).', 25662053: StringElement('We assessed whether short-term, pre-procedural, intensive statin treatment may reduce contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) incidence in patients with and without acute coronary syndromes (ACS) undergoing coronary angiography (CA) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'OBJECTIVE', u'Label': u'OBJECTIVES'}), 22841961: u'LcrV, a component of the type III secretion system (T3SS) translocon in Yersinia pestis, has been concerned in suppressing inflammation through Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) by inducing expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10). Previous studies have reported that LcrV aa E33, E34, K42 and/or E204 and E205 were important for interactions with TLR2 in vitro. While, recently there have been conflicting reports doubting this interaction and its importance in vivo. To further investigate the role of these residues, we replaced the wild-type lcrV gene on the pCD1Ap virulence plasmid of Y. pestis with lcrV2345 gene, which encodes a mutant protein by substituting all five of the amino acid residues with glutamine. The characteristics of the wild-type LcrV and mutant LcrV2345 were evaluated in tissue culture and mice. When purified protein was incubated with HEK293 cells synthesizing human TLR2 with or without CD14, LcrV2345 induced higher levels of IL-8 than wild-type LcrV, indicating that the LcrV2345 was not impaired in its ability to interact with TLR2. LcrV2345 stimulated higher levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\\u03b1) production than LcrV in J774A.1 cells, while neither protein elicited significant levels of IL-10. We also found there was no statistically significant difference in virulence between strains with wild-type LcrV and with mutated LcrV2345 administered by either subcutaneous or intranasal route in mice. Additionally, there were no discernible differences in survival kinetics. Serum levels of cytokines, such as IL-10 and TNF-\\u03b1, bacterial burden, and the extent of organ inflammation were also indistinguishable in both strains.

Previous studies present conflicting reports as to the maximum rate at which retinal ganglion cells can \"follow\" pulse trains, i.e., generate one spike for each pulse of the train. In the present study, we measured the response of 5 different types of rabbit retinal ganglion cells to pulse trains of 100-700 Hz. Surprisingly, we found significant heterogeneity in the ability of different types to follow pulse trains. For example, brisk transient (BT) ganglion cells could reliably follow pulse rates up to 600 pulses per second (PPS). In contrast, other types could not even follow rates of 200 PPS. There was additional heterogeneity in the response patterns across those types that could not follow high-rate trains. For example, some types generated action potentials in response to approximately every other pulse, whereas other types generated one spike per pulse for a few consecutive pulses and then did not generate any spikes in response to the next few pulses. Interestingly, in the types that could not follow high-rate trains, we found a second type of response: many pulses of the train elicited a biphasic waveform with an amplitude much smaller than that of standard action potentials. This small waveform was often observed following every pulse for which a standard spike was not elicited. A possible origin of the small waveform and its implication for effective retinal stimulation are discussed.', 6474353: 'Conflicting reports have appeared in the recent literature on a presumed association between coffee intake and \"fibrocystic breast disease.\" The hypothesis suggesting that abstention from coffee and caffeine consumption eliminates breast pain and resolves breast nodules was based on an uncontrolled clinical study. For a condition with a notorious reputation for \"waxing and waning,\" it is essential to document the stability versus instability of clinical findings, keeping the methyl xanthine consumption constant. Seventy-two women, all with palpable breast nodules, were followed over a 6-month period with monthly examinations and questionnaires on intake of coffee, tea, soft drinks, chocolate, candies, and caffeine-containing drugs. The methyl xanthine consumption remained remarkably constant throughout the observation time. The examiner was uninformed as to previous examination findings and pain reports of each woman. In 21 (15%) breasts with nodularity, the nodules had completely disappeared by the termination of the study. A total of 125 (87%) breasts of the sample manifested a change in the number of nodules or a change in position. Forty-eight of the 72 women were menopausal. For a chronic condition with so much variety of subjective sensitivity and great variability of objective clinical palpation, it is difficult to relate the amount of methyl xanthine consumption to \"fibrocystic breast disease.\"', 3129449: \"There have been conflicting reports on whether antithyroid drugs (ATD) act as immunosuppressive agents in patients with autoimmune thyroid disease. While some have claimed that methimazole (MMI) affects the immune system directly, we and others have suggested that its apparent immunosuppressive activity is due to its ability to inhibit thyrocyte, rather than immunocyte, activity. To further address the question, we studied the action of ATD on interferon-gamma (IFN gamma)-induced HLA-DR expression on thyrocytes in tissue culture. We used a cytotoxicity assay, using chromium-51-labeled Graves' disease (GD) thyrocytes and normal thyrocytes incubated sequentially with a monoclonal antibody against HLA-DR and complement, with a cytotoxicity index as the measure of thyrocyte HLA-DR expression. MMI and propylthiouracil (PTU) were added along with 200 U/mL IFN gamma to thyrocytes cultured for 10-14 days. IFN gamma or supernatants from leukoagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) stimulated thyrocyte HLA-DR expression; however, the addition of MMI or PTU to either the PBMC or thyrocytes caused no inhibition of the IFN gamma or PBMC IFN gamma stimulation of thyrocyte HLA-DR expression, using either normal or GD thyrocytes. Potassium perchlorate and sodium iodide also had no effect on IFN gamma-induced thyrocyte HLA-DR expression. TSH (either bovine or human) did not induce HLA-DR expression on thyrocytes by itself, but did enhance IFN gamma-induced HLA-DR expression in normal, but not GD, thyrocytes; once again, the further addition of MMI or PTU did not inhibit the enhancing effect of TSH on thyrocyte HLA-DR expression. Low concentrations of TSH binding inhibitory immunoglobulin (TBII; 100 micrograms/mL) did not alter the cytotoxicity index, but at 400 micrograms/mL or more it enhanced HLA-DR expression on normal, but not GD, thyrocytes in a manner similar to TSH; like TSH, it did not induce thyrocyte HLA-DR expression by itself. Moreover, addition of MMI to the combination of IFN gamma and TBII did not inhibit the response of thyrocytes in terms of HLA-DR expression. We conclude that ATD do not alter thyrocyte HLA-DR expression in vitro; however, the ATD may still cause immune effects in vivo secondary to their influence on thyroid hormone formation or synthesis or by inhibition of thyroid antigen presentation which indirectly may result in an immunomodulatory effect. While TSH and TBII similarly enhanced the IFN gamma-induced expression of HLA-DR on normal thyrocytes, they did not do so in GD thyrocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\", 2493048: 'In an attempt to evaluate the role of IFN-gamma in autoimmune arthritis, we tested the effects of IFN-gamma and anti-IFN-gamma mAb (DB-1) in various phases of arthritis development in a rat model for rheumatoid arthritis; the adjuvant arthritis (AA) model, induced by immunization with CFA. In addition, the effects of IFN-gamma were tested in vitro on T cell clones derived from rats afflicted with AA. T cell clone A2b, which has been shown to be arthritogenic secreted low amounts of IFN-gamma and its Ag-specific proliferation was inhibited by IFN-gamma. In contrast, clone A2c, which can inhibit the development of AA, produced high amounts of IFN-gamma and its proliferation was increased by IFN-gamma. In vivo administration of IFN-gamma 24 h before CFA caused an enhancement of arthritis, whereas giving IFN-gamma 24 to 48 h after CFA suppressed the disease. Administration of IFN-gamma between day +4 to +12 or between day +12 to +24 increased the severity of the first phase of the disease, but had no effect later. Administration of DB-1 1 to 2 days before adjuvant or between day +4 to +8 substantially decreased the disease, whereas DB-1 given from day +12 to +24 significantly enhanced it. Taken together, these results illustrate the heterogeneity of IFN-gamma in autoimmune arthritis and suggest a rational explanation for the possibly conflicting reports regarding the role(s) and effects of IFN-gamma in autoimmune processes. The multistage nature of T cell-mediated autoimmune arthritis may be due to the predominance of distinct T cell populations at different stages of the disease. The differences in the biologic activities of these T cells may be due to their patterns of lymphokine production.', 28661183: '165b, a member of the inhibitory family.

Our previous studies have showed that cytochrome c released from the mitochondria was an early event by western blot analysis and caspase-3 activation was closely related to cytochrome c release during apoptosis induced by baculovirus in Spodoptera litura cells (Sl-1 cell line). In the present study, alteration in mitochondrial morphology was observed by transmission electron microscopy, and cytochrome c release from mitochondria in apoptotic Sl-1 cells induced with Anagrapha falcifera multiple nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AfMNPV) has further been confirmed by immunofluoresence staining protocol, suggesting that structural disruption of mitochondria and the release of cytochrome c are important events during Lepidoptera insect cell apoptosis. We also used Sl-1 cell-free extract system and the technique of RNA interference to further investigate the role of cytochrome c in apoptotic Sl-1 cells induced by AfMNPV. Caspase-3 activity in cell-free extracts supplemented with exogenous cytochrome c was determined and showed an increase with the extension of incubation time. DsRNA-mediated silencing of cytochrome c resulted in the inhibition of apoptosis and protected the cells from AfMNPV-induced cell death. Silencing of expression of cytochrome c had a remarkable effect on pro-caspase-3 and pro-caspase-9 activation and resulted in the reduction of caspase-3 and caspase-9 activity in Sl-1 cells undergoing apoptosis. Caspase-9 inhibitor could inhibit activation of pro-caspase-3, and the inhibition of the function of Apaf-1 with FSBA blocked apoptosis, hinting that Apaf-1 could be involved in Sl-1 cell apoptosis induced by AfMNPV.

Quantitative biochemical analysis showed that the microtubule-depolymerizing drug nocodazole inhibited arrival of influenza hemagglutinin on the apical plasma membrane in MDCK cells grown on both substrata. In contrast, the microtubule-stabilizing drug taxol inhibited apical appearance of hemagglutinin only when MDCK cells were grown on permeable substrata. On the basis of hemagglutinin mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels and its sensitivity to endo H, it was evident that nocodazole and taxol arrested hemagglutinin at different intracellular sites. Neither drug caused a significant increase in the amount of hemagglutinin detected on the basolateral plasma membrane domain. In addition, neither drug had any noticeable effect on the transport of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-G protein to the basolateral surface.

However, there are conflicting reports as to the efficacy of gloves in protecting workers. The goal of this study was to use a characterized animal model of vibration-induced peripheral vascular and nerve injury to determine whether antivibration materials reduced or inhibited the effects of vibration on these physiological symptoms. Rats were exposed to 4 h of tail vibration at 125 Hz with an acceleration 49 m/s(2). The platform was either bare or covered with antivibrating glove material. Rats were tested for tactile sensitivity to applied pressure before and after vibration exposure. One day following the exposure, ventral tail arteries were assessed for sensitivity to vasodilating and vasoconstricting factors and nerves were examined histologically for early indicators of edema and inflammation. Ventral tail artery responses to an \\u03b12C-adrenoreceptor agonist were enhanced in arteries from vibration-exposed rats compared to controls, regardless of whether antivibration materials were used or not. Rats exposed to vibration were also less sensitive to pressure after exposure. These findings are consistent with experimental findings in humans suggesting that antivibration gloves may not provide protection against the adverse health consequences of vibration exposure in all conditions.

Continuous measurements of middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity (CBFv; DWL MultiDop X2) and radial artery blood pressure (ABP; Colin 7000) were recorded in the supine position during a single experimental session.

Previous studies on intermittent hypoxia (IH) in rats that demonstrated pulmonary hypertension utilized relatively long periods of hypoxia. Recent studies that utilized brief periods of hypoxia have conflicting reports of right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy. In addition, many studies have not measured pulmonary hemodynamics to asses the severity of pulmonary hypertension in vivo. Given the increasing availability of genetically engineered mice and the need to establish a rodent model of IH-induced pulmonary hypertension, we studied the effect of IH (2-min cycles of 10% and 21% O2, 8 h/day, 4 wk) on wild-type mice, correlating in vivo measurements of pulmonary hypertension with RV mass and pulmonary vascular remodeling. RV systolic pressure was increased after IH (36 +/- 0.9 mmHg) compared with normoxia (29.5 +/- 0.6) but was lower than continuous hypoxia (44.2 +/- 3.4). RV mass [RV-to-(left ventricle plus septum) ratio] correlated with pressure measurements (IH = 0.27 +/- 0.02, normoxia = 0.22 +/- 0.01, and continuous hypoxia = 0.34 +/- 0.01). Hematocrits were also elevated after IH and continuous hypoxia (56 +/- 1.6 and 54 +/- 1.1 vs. 44.3 +/- 0.5%). Evidence of neomuscularization of the distal pulmonary circulation was found after IH and continuous hypoxia. We conclude that mice develop pulmonary hypertension following IH, representing a possible animal model of pulmonary hypertension in response to the repetitive hypoxia-reoxygenation of sleep apnea.', 17466005: StringElement('Adiponectin is an insulin-sensitizing protein that circulates in oligomeric complexes, including trimers, hexamers and high-molecular-weight (HMW) multimers.

Expression of the HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins is believed to contribute to the carcinogenic process. Progressive loss of the ability to differentiate and resistance to the growth-inhibitory effects of endogenous signals also appear important in multistep tumorigenesis. Transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) is a potent growth inhibitor for a variety of cultured cells. There have been conflicting reports on the ability of TGF-beta1 to inhibit the growth of HPV-positive keratinocytes in monolayer cultures. We have employed the organotypic (raft) tissue culture system, which more accurately mimics the in vivo cellular environment and architecture. We have investigated the TGF-beta1 response of HPV-positive keratinocytes derived from neoplastic cervical biopsies. Growth of these cell lines as raft tissues showed that many were altered in the ability to stratify and synthesize differentiation-specific proteins. When the organotypic tissues were treated with TGF-beta1, a more complete differentiation of the keratinocytes was induced. Treatment with 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate gave similar results. TGF-beta1 treatment of HPV-positive raft epithelia led to a dose-dependent increase in E7 RNA expression in contrast to results from previous studies with monolayer cultures. Furthermore, TGF-beta1 interfered with the proliferation of HPV-positive cell lines grown in monolayer cultures. Our results suggest that loss of the ability to express markers of differentiation, a characteristic of malignancy, is a two-step process. The first step is reversible; the second is irreversible.', 6826649: 'When eukaryotic cells are exposed to elevated temperatures they respond by vigorously synthesizing a small group of proteins called the heat shock proteins. An essential element in defining the role of these proteins is determining whether they are unique to a stressed state or are also found in healthy, rapidly growing cells at normal temperatures. To date, there have been conflicting reports concerning the major heat-induced protein of Drosophila cells, HSP 70. We report the development of monoclonal antibodies specific for this protein. These antibodies were used to assay HSP 70 in cells incubated under different culture conditions. The protein was detectable in cells maintained at normal temperatures, but only when immunological techniques were pushed to the limits of their sensitivity. To test for the possibility that these cells contain a reservoir of protein in a cryptic antigenic state (i.e., waiting posttranslational modification for use at high temperature), we treated cells with cycloheximide or actinomycin D immediately before heat shock. HSP 70 was not detected in these cells. Finally, we tested for the presence of a reservoir of inactive messages by using a high stringency hybridization of 32P-labeled cloned gene sequences to electrophoretically separated RNAs. Although HSP 70 mRNA was detectable in rapidly growing cells, it was present at less than 1/1,000th the level achieved after induction.', 26757191: StringElement(\"Simvastatin (SV) has been reported to improve dementia and slow progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), however there are conflicting reports.\", attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'BACKGROUND', u'Label': u'BACKGROUND'}), 28818090: StringElement('Measuring and monitoring progress towards Millennium Development Goals (MDG) 4 and 5 requires valid and reliable estimates of maternal and neonatal mortality.

Eleven subjects with stable steroid-dependent asthma were enrolled in a placebo-controlled double-blind crossover trial. Patients received methotrexate, 15 mg/wk, or placebo each for two 12-week periods. There was significant improvement of pulmonary function and reduction of prednisone requirement in both placebo and methotrexate treatment periods. However, methotrexate was not superior to placebo.

There are no reports of consistent studies on vitamin status of water soluble vitamins in CRI. Vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency several authors found most frequently in CAPD patients. The cause of this deficiency depends probably on increased requirement of vitamin B1 due to high glucose intake with peritoneal dialysis solution. In patients with polyneuropathy high doses of thiamine pyrophosphate (Cocarboxylase), given i.v., can be helpful in this respect. There are conflicting reports concerning plasma level of vitamin B2 (riboflavin) in CRI patients. Some authors recommend its supplementation. The majority of patients with CRI exhibit biochemical and clinical signs of vitamin B6 deficiency. There exists an univocal opinion that supplementation of this vitamin effects the cellular immune system and the amino acid metabolism as well. An adequate dose of vitamin B6 is still a matter of dispute. Evidence of vitamin B12 deficiency has been reported rarely, thus, only few authors recommend the supplementation of it, mainly in CAPD patients.

The vast majority of patients, especially children that require PVR, obtain a tissue valve because of the relative good durability and the lack of a need for anticoagulation. Because the need for repeat operation is inevitable for most patients, and the population of adults with congenital heart disease continues to grow, there are increasing situations in which a mechanical pulmonary prosthesis may be appropriate. Most patients being considered for mechanical PVR have a congenital diagnosis and require multi-valve procedures, and quality of life and need for repeat operation(s) are major issues. Mechanical valves are durable but require anticoagulation, which carries its own inherent set of risks. There are conflicting reports regarding the late outcome of mechanical PVR.

To resolve this, we anesthetized eight cockerels with sodium pentobarbital (25-35 mg/kg), cannulated the cutaneous ulnar vein and carotid artery, opened the thorax and ventilated right and left lungs independently. We established PaCO2 by over-ventilating the denervated, perfused right lung with the following: 94.7, 39.9, 31.6 and 19.0 Torr PCO2 balanced with oxygen. At each right lung CO2 tension (PRCO2), we measured blood pressure and ventilatory responses to five CO2 tensions (PLCO2) ventilating the non-perfused left lung. PLCO2 ranged from 70.3 to 15.7 Torr. We found a linear relationship between the amplitude of sternal deflections and PaCO2-1, and that the slope depended upon PLCO2. Respiratory period was also linearly related to PaCO2-1, however the intercept, not the slope, was a altered by PLCO2. Stepwise regression analyses revealed an important interaction term (that is, (PaCO2.PLCO2)-1) in the determination of respiratory amplitude, but not in the determination of period. We conclude that low intrapulmonary PCO2 enhances the sensitivity of respiratory amplitude to changes in PaCO2.

At the same time, a crisis in the literature has become apparent: there are conflicting reports on whether or not these interventions work. With the aim of understanding the reason for the dissension in the literature, six studies were selected for close examination. These were studies of interventions based on differing principles, i.e. a change in organizational ethos to promote back safety, back belt use, the introduction of ergonomic devices, and back-strengthening exercises. If the studies are taken at face value, any of the interventions, regardless of type, has a tremendous effect. Methodological problems inherent in these studies may provide a clue to why essentially different interventions were found to be consistently successful. Study design quality has long been noted to exert a particular influence on the evaluation of outcomes: the quality of the study design is often inversely related to reported outcomes. Of the six studies selected for examination, four did not include a contemporaneous control group, five did not randomly assign subjects to test and control groups, and none included a placebo group. Given these research designs, variables other than those tested by the studies may have produced the reported results. These variables include 'beliefs of the intervention providers' and 'coalescence of the work group', both of which are discussed. Two approaches, the pragmatic and the explanatory, may be used to study workplace interventions to prevent low-back disorders. Most of the examined studies are pragmatically oriented. Having dealt with study design problems expeditiously, these studies may be characterized as more immediately responsive to the demand to evaluate workplace interventions than explanatory studies. On the other hand, explanatory studies, most notably associated with randomized clinical trials in medicine, are more rigorous. Enough pragmatically oriented studies have been conducted to suggest that workplace interventions may have an effect on low-back disorders.

Cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) and membrane potential (V(m)) play important roles in this process by controlling EC-dependent vasoactive signals and intercellular communication. The present mathematical model integrates plasmalemma electrophysiology and Ca(2+) dynamics to investigate EC responses to different stimuli and the controversial relationship between [Ca(2+)](i) and V(m). The model contains descriptions for the intracellular balance of major ionic species and the release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores. It also expands previous formulations by including more detailed transmembrane current descriptions. The model reproduces V(m) responses to volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC) blockers and extracellular K(+) concentration ([K(+)](o)) challenges, predicting 1) that V(m) changes upon VRAC blockade are [K(+)](o) dependent and 2) a biphasic response of V(m) to increasing [K(+)](o). Simulations of agonist-induced Ca(2+) mobilization replicate experiments under control and V(m) hyperpolarization blockade conditions. They show that peak [Ca(2+)](i) is governed by store Ca(2+) release while Ca(2+) influx (and consequently V(m)) impacts more the resting and plateau [Ca(2+)](i). The V(m) sensitivity of rest and plateau [Ca(2+)](i) is dictated by a [Ca(2+)](i) \"buffering\" system capable of masking the V(m)-dependent transmembrane Ca(2+) influx. The model predicts plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase and Ca(2+) permeability as main players in this process.

The objective of this report was to determine the incidence, predisposing factors, and outcome of postlaryngectomy pharyngocutaneous fistula in patients operated on in our department and to describe the management of the complication.The medical records of 146 consecutive patients who underwent laryngeal surgery for squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx between 1990 and 2005 were assessed. All patients had similar preoperative/postoperative care. We studied a number of factors that could influence fistula formation such as age, gender, smoking, systemic disease, preoperative radiotherapy, previous tracheotomy, site of tumor, surgical procedure, positive surgical margins, type of closure (T vs. vertical), concurrent neck dissection, suture material, clinical stage, histologic grade, and experience of surgeon (consultant vs. resident). A pharyngocutaneous fistula was observed in 13% (19/146) of the patients within a mean time of 9.6 days from surgery. Spontaneous closure with local wound care was noted in 17 (89%) patients whereas a surgical closure was necessary in two. One patient required surgical closure by direct suture of the pharyngeal mucosa. Pectoralis major myocutaneous flap was used in another one. Our findings showed that fistula formation was significantly more common in patients who received previous radiotherapy or who had positive surgical resection margins or had a systemic disease. The mean healing time was 26 days. We concluded that pharyngocutaneous fistula remains a troublesome complication of the early postoperative period after total laryngectomy. There are many conflicting reports in the literature concerning the predisposing factors, but our data showed that the presence of systemic diseases, previous radiotherapy, and positive surgical margins can all be important predisposing factors, or at least underlying causes.

The major subunit(s) of the enzyme have been attributed to polypeptides of relative molecular weight (M(r)) 64,500 (Beta vulgaris), 67,000 (Beta vulgaris), 73,000 (Vigna radiata), and 37,000 to 45,000 (Zea mays). Here, we reconcile these differences to show, through the combined application of independent purification, affinity-labeling, sequencing, and immunological procedures, that the major polypeptide associated with the H(+)-PPase from all of these organisms, and Arabidopsis thaliana, corresponds to the same moiety. The principal polypeptide components of the H(+)-PPase purified from Beta and Vigna by independent procedures have similar apparent subunit masses when subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under identical conditions (M(r(Beta)) = 64,500; M(r(Vigna)) = 66,000) and exhibit identical kinetics of irreversible inhibition and ligand-modified labeling by [(14)C]-N-ethylmaleimide. Similarly, the M(r) 64,500 and 67,000 polypeptides isolated from Beta by independent methods (cf. C.J. Britten, J.C. Turner, P.A. Rea [1989] FEBS Lett 256: 200-206 versus V. Sarafian and R.J. Poole [1989] Plant Physiol 91: 34-38) are indistinguishable: the two polypeptides comigrate when electrophoresed under the same conditions and yield tryptic fragments with identical overlapping sequences. Because both the N-terminal sequence of the M(r) 66,000 subunit of the H(+)-PPase isolated from Vigna and the direct sequence data from Beta align precisely with the deduced amino acid sequence of cDNAs encoding the H(+)-PPase of Arabidopsis, all three enzymes are inferred to be highly conserved structurally. Accordingly, immunoblots of membranes prepared from Arabidopsis, Beta, Vigna, and Zea, probed with antibody affinity purified against the magnesium inorganic pyrophosphate-binding, M(r) 66,000 polypeptide of Vigna, reveal a single immunoreactive band at M(r) 64,500 to 67,000 in all four preparations. The M(r) 66,000 polypeptide of Zea membranes is, however, prone to proteolysis during membrane fractionation and selective aggregation during sample denaturation for SDS-PAGE. The anomalous M(r) 37,000 to 45,000 subunit pattern previously ascribed to the H(+)-PPase from Zea (A. Chanson and P.E. Pilet [1989] Plant Physiol 90: 934-938) is attributed to loss of the M(r) 66,000 subunit and the appearance of polypeptide fragments of M(r) 44,700 and 39,000 through the combined effects of sample aggregation before SDS-PAGE and proteolysis, respectively. It is, therefore, concluded that the substrate-binding subunit of the tonoplast H(+)-PPase has a common identity in all four organisms.', 11520765: StringElement('To determine, in vitro, the effects of blood group ABO mismatching on corneal epithelial cells.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'OBJECTIVE', u'Label': u'AIM'}), 22616830: StringElement('There have been conflicting reports on the efficacy of recombinant human activated protein C, or drotrecogin alfa (activated) (DrotAA), for the treatment of patients with septic shock.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'BACKGROUND', u'Label': u'BACKGROUND'}), 20368127: StringElement('There are conflicting reports regarding the effects of atrazine (ATZ) on amphibian development.

Researchers have reported that components fabricated from 1900 resin may oxidize to a lesser extent than components fabricated from GUR resin during shelf aging after gamma sterilization in air. Conflicting reports on the oxidation resistance for 1900 raise the question of whether resin or manufacturing method, or an interaction between resin and manufacturing method, influences the mechanical behavior of UHMWPE. We conducted a series of accelerated aging studies (no aging, aging in oxygen or in nitrogen) to systematically examine the influence of resin (GUR or 1900), manufacturing method (bulk compression molding or extrusion), and sterilization method (none, in air, or in nitrogen) on the mechanical behavior of UHMWPE. The small punch testing technique was used to evaluate the mechanical behavior of the materials, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to characterize the oxidation in selected samples. Our study showed that the sterilization environment, aging condition, and specimen location (surface or subsurface) significantly affected the mechanical behavior of UHMWPE. Each of the three polyethylenes evaluated seem to degrade according to a similar pathway after artificial aging in oxygen and gamma irradiation in air. The initial ability of the materials to exhibit post-yield strain hardening was significantly compromised by degradation.

Currently, conflicting reports exist regarding the role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the etiology of ALD. The glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) is the ER homolog of HSP70 and plays a critical role in the cellular response to ER stress by serving as a chaperone assisting protein folding and by regulating the signaling of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Comprising three functional domains, an ATPase, a peptide-binding, and a lid domain, GRP78 folds nascent polypeptides via the substrate-binding domain. Earlier work has indicated that the ATPase function of GRP78 is intrinsically linked and essential to its chaperone activity. Previous work in our laboratory has indicated that GRP78 and the UPR are not induced in a mouse model of ALD but that GRP78 is adducted by the lipid electrophiles 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and 4-oxononenal (4-ONE) in vivo. As impairment of GRP78 has the potential to contribute to pathogenesis in ALD, we investigated the functional consequences of aldehyde adduction on GRP78 function. Identification of 4-HNE and 4-ONE target residues in purified human GRP78 revealed a marked propensity for Lys and His adduction within the ATPase domain and a relative paucity of adduct formation within the peptide-binding domain. Consistent with these findings, we observed a concomitant dose-dependent decrease in ATP-binding and ATPase activity without any discernible impairment of chaperone function. Collectively, our data indicate that ATPase activity is not essential for GRP78-mediated chaperone activity and is consistent with the hypothesis that ER stress does not play a primary initiating role in the early stages of ALD.', 27425557: 'The passive tensile properties of skeletal muscle play a key role in its physiological function. Previous research has identified conflicting reports of muscle transverse isotropy, with some data suggesting the longitudinal direction is stiffest, while others show the transverse direction is stiffest. Accurate constitutive models of skeletal muscle must be employed to provide correct recommendations for and observations of clinical methods. The goal of this work was to identify transversely isotropic tensile muscle properties as a function of post mortem handling. Six pairs of tibialis anterior muscles were harvested from Giant Flemish rabbits and split into two groups: fresh testing (within four hours post mortem), and non-fresh testing (subject to delayed testing and a freeze/thaw cycle). Longitudinal and transverse samples were removed from each muscle and tested to identify tensile modulus and relaxation behavior. Longitudinal non-fresh samples exhibited a higher initial modulus value and faster relaxation than longitudinal fresh, transverse fresh, and transverse rigor samples (p<0.05), while longitudinal fresh samples were less stiff at lower strain levels than longitudinal non-fresh, transverse fresh, and transverse non-fresh samples (p<0.05), but exhibited more nonlinear behavior. While fresh skeletal muscle exhibits a higher transverse modulus than longitudinal modulus, discrepancies in previously published data may be the result of a number of differences in experimental protocol. Constitutive modeling of fresh muscle should reflect these data by identifying the material as truly transversely isotropic and not as an isotropic matrix reinforced with fibers.', 667097: 'We have undertaken a study to resolve the conflicting reports on the substrate specificity of the lipolytic enzyme(s) released by heparin from liver and report the following: (1) Heparin perfusates from liver contain an enzyme(s) capable of degrading triacylglycerol, diacylglycerophosphorylethanolamine and monoacylglycerol, whereas a heparin-solubilized fraction from liver plasma membranes hydrolyzes diacylglycerophosphorylethanolamine and monoacylglycerol only; (2) The lipolytic activities for the two sources behave differently on gel filtration but have the same behavior on heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography; (3) Treatment of the preparation from the plasma membrane with Triton X-100 followed by heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography produces forms of the enzyme(s) that now have activity on triacylglycerol This study suggests that the enzyme(s) from the two sources may be the same and that some change occurs when the enzyme is released from the intact liver.', 21236504: StringElement('As a risk factor of coronary artery disease (CAD), gender might be associated with the prognosis of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

After the discovery of methods to quantify different molecular fractions of prostate specific antigen (PSA), its usefulness in diagnosing early prostate cancer cases has increased tremendously. The \"specificity\" of PSA, is now challenged by many studies which proved that PSA, once believed to be secreted exclusively by prostatic epithelium, is also present in females. The exact biological role of extraprostatic PSA is still debatable though many theories substantiated by in vitro evidence has been put forward. With the advent of ultrasensitive analytical techniques, PSA is now quantifiable in female serum in its various molecular forms and this has led to many assumptions of it being useful as a marker in female breast cancers. In a similar scenario to prostate cancer, the ratio of free to total PSA is shown to be useful in detecting early breast cancer cases. It is also shown to be a good prognostic indicator and a predictor of response to therapy and recurrence. Apart from its role in breast cancer, it has been advocated to be a marker of hyper androgenic states in women like hirsutism and polycystic ovarian syndrome. Conflicting reports regarding the role of extra prostatic PSA is accumulating but it has been proven beyond doubt that PSA is no longer specific and confined to prostate gland. Various studies have registered that PSA is an ubiquitous molecule, secreted by hormone responsive organs and its synthesis is stimulated by androgens and progesterone but not oestrogens.

Over a period of up to 3 years the average fall in cholesterol was 5.9 mg/100 ml/year in the placebo group and 5.0 mg/100 ml/year in the actively treated group.

This result reconciles previous conflicting reports about the number of domains of this protein obtained by differential scanning calorimetry and small-angle X-ray scattering. The number of two-state transitions decreases when the pH of the medium is decreased, without noticeable changes in its circular dichroism spectrum.

A wide range of spatial stimuli have been used to measure flicker sensitivity in amblyopia and we have considered the possibility that reported inconsistancies in results are due to a confounding of spatial and temporal stimulus parameters. To address this question we have measured contrast sensitivity from a sample of eight strabismic/anisometropic amblyopes using (1) stationary sinusoidal gratings, (2) uniform field flicker and (3) counterphased flickering gratings. In each case the contrast sensitivity deficits were predictably determined by the spatial properties of the stimulus (spot size or spatial frequency), and the spatial characteristics of the amblyopia. Results are nearly independent of the temporal properties of the stimulus. Specifically, when the stimulus is sufficiently large, or consists of low spatial frequencies, no temporal deficits are found. We conclude that conflicts between previous reports are attributable primarily to differences in spatial characteristics of the stimuli used.', 10864100: 'Epinephrine (E) infusions raise blood pressure and there is an excess incidence of hypertension among males and blacks. However, reports of E levels by ethnicity, gender, and blood pressure status are inconsistent. Insensitive assays, variability in plasma E levels within individuals, and the small size of most studies have contributed to these conflicting reports. We measured plasma E levels in a large diverse sample of subjects, using a highly sensitive assay. A total of 361 individuals participated in the study: 61% were men and 39% women, 74% were normotensive and 26% hypertensive, 59% were white and 41% were black. Except for difference in blood pressure and body mass index between the normotensives and hypertensives, subjects had similar baseline characteristics and took no antihypertensive medications for at least five days prior to sampling. All blood samples were collected after resting for a least 30 minutes following the insertion of an indwelling i.v. catheter. Catecholamine levels were determined using a radioenzymatic assay (assay sensitivities for E and norepinephrine were 6 pg/ml and 10 pg/ml, respectively). An ethnicity by gender interaction was found (F(1,315) = 5.126, p = .024). Subsequent analysis revealed that white women had significantly lower basal plasma E levels than white men (p <0.001) and black women (p = 0.036). There were no significant differences in E levels between black men and women or between white men and black men. Uncorrected E levels were lower in normotensive than hypertensive subjects (p = .009) but this difference was not significant when corrected for body mass index (BMI). Uncorrected norepinephrine levels were higher in women than men (p = .03) but the difference was no longer significant when corrected for BMI. Plasma E levels were significantly lower among white women than men or black women. In contrast to prior studies, E levels were lower in hypertensives, but this may reflect obesity among hypertensives.', 25496719: StringElement('The risk of Poly Implant Prosthesis (PIP) breast implant failure has been quantified by the Department of Health as 2-6 times greater than other brands.

There are conflicting reports in the literature as to whether SFRP2 is an antagonist or agonist of \\u03b2-catenin. The aims of these studies were to assess the effects of SFRP2 antagonism on tumor growth and Wnt-signaling and to evaluate whether SFRP2 is a viable therapeutic target. The antiangiogenic and antitumor properties of SFRP2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) were assessed using in vitro proliferation, migration, tube formation assays, and in vivo angiosarcoma and triple-negative breast cancer models. Wnt-signaling was assessed in endothelial and tumor cells treated with SFRP2 mAb using Western blotting. Pharmacokinetic and biodistribution data were generated in tumor-bearing and nontumor-bearing mice. SFRP2 mAb was shown to induce antitumor and antiangiogenic effects in vitro and inhibit activation of \\u03b2-catenin and nuclear factor of activated T-cells c3 (NFATc3) in endothelial and tumor cells. Treatment of SVR angiosarcoma allografts in nude mice with the SFRP2 mAb decreased tumor volume by 58% compared with control (P = 0.004). Treatment of MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma xenografts with SFRP2 mAb decreased tumor volume by 52% (P = 0.03) compared with control, whereas bevacizumab did not significantly reduce tumor volume. Pharmacokinetic studies show the antibody is long circulating in the blood and preferentially accumulates in SFRP2-positive tumors. In conclusion, antagonizing SFRP2 inhibits activation of \\u03b2-catenin and NFATc3 in endothelial and tumor cells and is a novel therapeutic approach for inhibiting angiosarcoma and triple-negative breast cancer.', 3281765: 'There have been conflicting reports of the value of naloxone infusions to prevent the side-effects associated with epidural morphine. In our study, 29 patients undergoing thoracotomies for pulmonary surgery received epidural morphine (0.1 mg.kg-1) shortly after induction of anaesthesia.

In recent years, increasing experimental and clinical data have provided compelling evidence for the involvement of oxidative stress in a large number of pathological states including cancers. The aim of this study was to measure the concentration of serum total proteins and albumin as potent anti-oxidants in the sera of patients diagnosed with speckled leukoplakia, one of the oral pre-cancerous lesions reported to have significantly high malignant transformation rates and well-differentiated oral squamous cell carcinoma. The study consisted of sera analysis of total protein and albumin levels in patients with speckled leukoplakia and histologically proven, well-differentiated oral squamous cell carcinoma. One way analyses of variance (ANOVA) was used to test the difference between groups. To find out which of the two groups' means were significantly different; post-hoc test of Scheffe was used. The study revealed variations in sera levels of albumin to be statistically significant. The results obtained emphasize the need for more studies with larger sample sizes to be conducted before a conclusive role for sera levels of total protein and albumin could be drawn as markers of transition from the various oral pre-cancerous lesions and conditions to frank oral squamous cell carcinoma.\", 12209009: \"Intracellular iron homeostasis is regulated posttranscriptionally by iron regulatory proteins 1 and 2 (IRP1 and IRP2). In the absence of iron in the labile pool, IRPs bind to specific nucleotide sequences called iron responsive elements (IREs), which are located in the 5' untranslated region of ferritin mRNA and the 3' untranslated region of transferrin receptor mRNA. IRP binding to the IREs suppresses ferritin translation and stabilizes transferrin receptor mRNA, whereas the opposite scenario develops in iron-replete cells. Binding of IRPs to the IREs is also affected by nitrogen monoxide (NO), but there are conflicting reports regarding the effect of NO on ferritin synthesis. In this study, we demonstrated that a short exposure of RAW 264.7 cells (a macrophage cell line) to the NO+ donor, sodium nitroprusside (SNP), resulted in a dramatic increase in ferritin synthesis. The SNP-mediated increase of ferritin synthesis could be blocked by MG132, an inhibitor of proteasome-dependent protein degradation, which also prevented the degradation of IRP2 caused by SNP treatment. Moreover, treatment of RAW 264.7 cells with IFN-gamma and lipopolysaccharide caused IRP2 degradation and stimulated ferritin synthesis, changes that could be prevented by specific inhibitors of inducible nitric oxide synthase. Furthermore, the SNP-mediated increase in ferritin synthesis was associated with a significant enhancement of iron incorporation into ferritin. These observations indicate that NO+-mediated modulation of IRP2 plays an important role in controlling ferritin synthesis and iron metabolism in murine macrophages.\", 23761782: 'Deficiency of growth hormone (GH) in adults results in a syndrome characterized by decreased muscle mass and exercise capacity, increased visceral fat, impaired quality of life, unfavorable alterations in lipid profile and markers of cardiovascular risk, decrease in bone mass and integrity, and increased mortality. When dosed appropriately, GH replacement therapy (GHRT) is well tolerated, with a low incidence of side effects, and improves most of the alterations observed in GH deficiency (GHD); beneficial effects on mortality, cardiovascular events, and fracture rates, however, remain to be conclusively demonstrated. The potential of GH to act as a mitogen has resulted in concern over the possibility of increased de novo tumors or recurrence of pre-existing malignancies in individuals treated with GH. Though studies of adults who received GHRT in childhood have produced conflicting reports in this regard, long-term surveillance of adult GHRT has not demonstrated increased cancer risk or mortality.', 25613176: 'Benign biliary strictures are a common indication for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).

The most common etiologies of strictures encountered are following surgery and those related to chronic pancreatitis. High-quality cross-sectional imaging provides a road map for endoscopic management. Currently, sequential placement of multiple plastic biliary stents represents the preferred approach. There is an increasing role for the treatment of these strictures using covered metal stents, but due to conflicting reports of efficacies as well as cost and complications, this approach should only be entertained following careful consideration. Optimal management of strictures is best achieved using a team approach with the surgeon and interventional radiologist playing an important role.', 20595577: 'The effects of elevated levels of metal ions in patients who have undergone metal-on-metal total hip arthroplasty are not fully understood.

The conduct of clinical trials of metal-on-metal total hip arthroplasties has been inadequate as few investigators have used a randomized controlled design to compare metal-on-metal bearings with other bearing surfaces.

The standards used in the assays were tested initially in the double-antibody RIA with the use of the reference from the World Health Organization. The results showed that RID as expected was relatively insensitive and IgE was reliably measured only above approximately 1,000 international units (IU). Moreover, certain sera containing low levels of IgE by the other procedures gave distinct precipitin zones and presumably falsely high levels of IgE protein. Thus RID may yield apparently erroneous results when used as a screening procedure for measurement of IgE levels. Among the other procedures PRIST and the double-antibody RIA showed the best agreement. With serum samples RIST yielded values for IgE in the low level range higher than those given by the PRIST and double-antibody RIA. With breast milk and colostrum, values of IgE between 120 and 690 ng/ml were found by RIST, whereas IgE was not detected by double-antibody RIA and PRIST. No evidence of an inhibitor of IgE was found in breast milk, so that the apparent elevation of IgE in breast milk by the RIST is likely false. These findings confirm prior reports of spurious elevations of IgE with the RIST and indicate the usefulness of the PRIST and double-antibody RIA for the measurement of IgE in sera and secretions.', 25367419: StringElement('Existing research and media reports convey conflicting impressions of trends in the prevalence of mental illness.

More than 80% of the diagnosis was made at the advanced stages of the disease, highlighting the urgent demand for novel biomarkers that can be used for early detection. Recently, a number of studies suggest that circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) could be potential biomarkers for GC diagnosis. Cancer-related circulating miRNAs, as well as tissue miRNAs, provide a hopeful prospect of detecting GC at early stages, and the prospective participation of miRNAs in biomarker development will enhance the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic tests for GC. As miRNAs in blood are stable, their potential value as diagnostic biomarkers in GC has been explored over the past few years. However, due to the inconsistent or sometimes conflicting reports, large-scale prospective studies are needed to validate their potential applicability in GC diagnosis. This review summarizes the current development about potential miRNA biomarkers for GC diagnosis and the obstacles hindering their clinical usage.', 15498048: 'Several cytokines have been implicated individually in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and some, including interleukin (IL)-10, IL-12 and IL-1ra are raised during flares of disease activity. Few studies have been directed at examining the interactions between these cytokines and how their combined profile relates to disease activity. We have examined serum levels of IL-10, IL-12 and IL-1ra in a cohort of SLE patients obtained from the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham in cross-sectional and, in a smaller group, longitudinal analyses. In the cross-sectional study, there were significant correlations between levels of the three cytokines. There were also significant correlations between levels of each cytokine and measures of disease activity. IL-10 levels correlated with ESR, anti-dsDNA antibody titres and C3D, IL-12 levels with anti-dsDNA antibody titres and IL-1ra levels with ESR, anti-dsDNA antibody titres and C3D. IL-1ra levels also correlated with CRP. Circulating IL-10 and IL-1ra levels were higher in patients with SLE than in normal controls, although in this study group they did not reach significance. Circulating IL-12 levels were, however, significantly higher in SLE compared to controls. This was true both in patients with active disease and those sampled during a quiescent phase. These data add to the evidence that cytokines such as IL-10, IL-12 and IL-1ra are important in SLE pathogenesis. In a retrospective study of serial serum samples from seven patients, we found two patients whose cytokine profile was very different from the rest of the group. In most patients normalized IL-10, IL-12 and IL-1ra levels mirrored BILAG scores closely, but in these two patients, IL-10, IL-12 and IL-1ra levels did not fluctuate with disease activity. It is possible that there is a subgroup of SLE patients whose cytokine profile could be an important indicator of their pathology. In order to confirm this and determine the frequency of such patients this study needs to be repeated with a much larger subject group. The coexistence of patient groups with different patterns of cytokine activity might explain conflicting reports of associations of levels of particular cytokines with SLE. As the observed differences could reflect different aetiologies of SLE, this information could reveal valuable endophenotypes for genetic and functional studies of SLE and might, ultimately, inform therapeutic management.', 14678916: StringElement('Originally developed to protect against sunburn, sunscreen has been assumed to prevent skin cancer.

The fast degradation of these membranes/matrices combined with transmembrane vascularization within 4 weeks has been observed in rats compared with the slow vascularization and continuous integration observed in mice. The aim of the present study was to analyze the tissue reaction to a porcine-based non-cross-linked collagen I-III membrane in mice. Using a subcutaneous implantation model, the membrane was implanted subcutaneously in mice for up to 60 days. The extent of scaffold vascularization, tissue integration and scaffold thickness were assessed using general and specialized histological methods, together with a unique histomorphometrical analysis technique. A dense Bombyx mori-derived silk fibroin membrane was used as a positive control, whilst a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane served as a negative control. Within the observation period, the collagen membrane induced a mononuclear cellular tissue response, including anti-inflammatory macrophages and the absence of multinucleated giant cells within its implantation bed. Transmembrane scaffold vascularization was not observed, whereas a mild scaffold vascularization was generated through microvessels located at both scaffold surfaces. However, the silk fibroin induced a mononuclear and multinucleated cell-based tissue response, in which pro-inflammatory macrophages and multinucleated giant cells were associated with an increasing transmembrane scaffold vascularization and a breakdown of the membrane within the experimental period. The PTFE membrane remained as a stable barrier throughout the study, and visible cellular degradation was not observed. However, multinucleated giant cells were located on both interfaces. The present study demonstrated that the tested non-cross-linked collagen membrane remained as a stable barrier membrane throughout the study period. The membrane integrated into the subcutaneous connective tissue and exhibited only a mild peripheral vascularization without experiencing breakdown. The silk fibroin, in contrast, induced granulation tissue formation, which resulted in its high vascularization and the breakdown of the material over time. The presence of multinucleated giant cells at both interfaces of the PFTE membrane is a sign of its slow cellular biodegradation and might lead to adhesions between the membrane and its surrounding tissue. This hypothesis could explain the observed clinical complications associated with the retrieval of these materials after guided tissue regeneration.', 2485127: 'The capacity of free-radical formation and concomitant radical-induced DNA damage by [Cu(PMA)]X (X = ClO4-, BF4-), the first crystalline synthetic analogue of Cu(II)-BLM, have been studied. In phosphate buffer, [Cu(PMA)]+ can be reduced by thiols like DTT to a Cu(I) species that can be reoxidized with dioxygen. During oxygenation of the Cu(I) analogue, appreciable amounts of .OH radical are formed. This fact has been established by spin-trapping experiments. Effects of SOD and catalase as well as pH on the ESR signal of the spin adduct have identified a set of reactions that eventually leads to .OH radical formation by [Cu(PMA)]+. Interestingly, the same reaction scheme has been proposed earlier for Cu(II)-BLM. In the presence of DTT and dioxygen, [Cu(PMA)]+ inflicts significant damage to plasmid DNA. That the damage does not arise from iron contamination has been established. The DNA damage is hindered when SOD or catalase is present in the incubation mixture. Less strand scission is observed at higher pH. Modulation of DNA cleavage efficiency with systematic variations in DTT concentration indicates that the conflicting reports on the ability of Cu(II)-BLM to mediate in vitro DNA damage might have resulted from the different DTT concentrations used by different groups.', 24898440: StringElement(\"To summarize the current knowledge relating to diagnosing and treating Scheuermann's disease.

The genetic toxicology of ETU is important given that ETU causes thyroid tumors in rodents and liver tumors in mice. Although it is clear that ETU induces thyroid tumors via a non-genotoxic, threshold mechanism, the role ETU plays in inducing mouse liver tumors remains to be fully elucidated. Recently, Dearfield (Mutation Res., 317, 111-132, 1994) reviewed the genetic toxicology of ETU, and concluded that, although ETU is not a potent genotoxic agent, it is weakly genotoxic. This view stands in contrast to reports from several independent authorities that have generally concurred that ETU is not a mammalian genotoxin (IARC, 1987; MAFF, 1990; NTP, 1992; FAO/WHO, 1994). These conflicting reports highlight a generic problem in genotoxicity safety assessment: although individual test results typically yield either a positive or negative response, the overall evaluation of an extensive battery of tests for a particular chemical rarely yields an unambiguous conclusion. Recently, Mendelsohn et al. (Mutation Res., 266, 43-60, 1992) showed that the response of a chemical to a battery of genotoxicity tests is not a dichotomous (i.e., either positive or negative) property, but rather, appears to be a continuous property that ranges from strongly negative to strongly positive. We have used these data, together with a four-step weight of the evidence procedure, to evaluate ETU. Our analysis indicates that ETU is not genotoxic in mammalian systems and suggests that ETU likely induces mouse liver tumors by a non-genotoxic mechanism.', 23638927: u'Nausea and vomiting are physiological processes experienced by every human being at some stage of their life.

In accordance with previous reports, the tail-flick responses in drug-free animals failed to reveal a conditioned compensatory hyperalgesia. Conditioning effects in the tail-flick test were found only when the animals were challenged with a low dose of morphine. However, the hot-plate responses in drug-free animals replicated earlier demonstrations of conditioned hyperalgesia. The results suggest that the measurement of conditioned responses in drug-free animals depends on characteristics of the assessment procedure.

We found that a sample of 45 PD patients with current depression was cognitively more impaired than a sample of 45 PD patients without current depression matched for age, education, gender, age at disease onset, disease duration, and disease severity. The domains of cognition impaired in the two PD groups (compared with 45 age-, education-, and gender-matched controls) overlapped considerably, but only the depressed PD group had impaired memory relative to the control group. Our comparison of 22 depressed PD patients and 22 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients matched for over-all severity of cognitive impairment, age, education, and gender indicated that the depressed PD group performed significantly worse on visuoconstructive tasks and marginally worse on conceptualization tasks. In contrast, the AD group performed significantly worse than the depressed PD group on memory tasks. Together, our results suggest that depression has a negative impact on cognition (and, in particular, memory) in PD, and that the pattern of this cognitive impairment is distinguishable from that associated with AD.\", 12172212: 'The MDR1 multidrug transporter plays a key role in determining drug bioavailability, and differences in drug response exist amongst different ethnic groups. Numerous studies have identified an association between the MDR1 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) exon 26 3435C>T and differences in MDR1 function. We performed a haplotype analysis of the MDR1 gene in three major ethnic groups (Chinese, Malays and Indians) by examining 10 intragenic SNPs. Four were polymorphic in all three ethnic groups: one occurring in the non-coding region and three occurring in coding exons. All three coding SNPs (exon 12 1236C>T, exon 21 2677G>T/A and exon 26 3435C>T) were present in high frequency in each ethnic group, and the derived haplotype profiles exhibited distinct differences between the groups. Fewer haplotypes were observed in the Malays (n = 6) compared to the Chinese (n = 10) and Indians (n = 9). Three major haplotypes (> 10% frequency) were observed in the Malays and Chinese; of these, two were observed in the Indians. Strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) was detected between the three SNPs in all three ethnic groups. The strongest LD was present in the Chinese, followed by Indians and Malays, with the corresponding LD blocks estimated to be approximately 80 kb, 60 kb and 40 kb, respectively. These data strongly support the hypothesis that strong LD between the neutral SNP exon 26 3435C>T and a nearby unobserved causal SNP underlies the observed associations between the neutral SNP and MDR1 functional differences. Furthermore, strong LD between exon 26 3435T and different unobserved causal SNPs in different study populations may provide a plausible explanation for conflicting reports associating the same exon 26 3435T allele with different MDR1 functional changes.', 28763062: 'Autoantibodies that bind the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) may underlie glutamate receptor hypofunction and related cognitive impairment found in schizophrenia. Exposure to neurotropic pathogens can foster an autoimmune-prone environment and drive systemic inflammation leading to endothelial barrier defects. In mouse model cohorts, we demonstrate that infection with the protozoan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, caused sustained elevations of IgG class antibodies to the NMDAR in conjunction with compromised blood-gut and blood-brain barriers. In human cohorts, NMDAR IgG and markers of barrier permeability were significantly associated with T. gondii exposure in schizophrenia compared with controls and independently of antipsychotic medication. Combined T. gondii and NMDAR antibody seropositivity in schizophrenia resulted in higher degrees of cognitive impairment as measured by tests of delayed memory. These data underscore the necessity of disentangling the heterogeneous pathophysiology of schizophrenia so that relevant subsets eligible for NMDAR-related treatment can be identified.

Conflicting reports can be found in the literature on the expression levels of efflux transporters in human intestine and how they vary along the intestine. The relative levels of mRNA and protein of CYP3A4 and the ABC tranporters Pgp (ABCB1), MRP1 (ABCC1), and MRP2 (ABCC2) were determined using RT-PCR and Western blot for human intestinal tissues (n = 14) from jejunum, ileum and colon. The expression of mRNA for CYP3A4, Pgp, and MRP2 was highest in jejunum and decreased toward more distal regions, whereas MRP1 was equally distributed in all intestinal regions. For CYP3A4, a more significant correlation could be established between mRNA and protein expression than for the ABC transporters. The samples showed considerable interindividual variability, especially at the protein level. The apically located Pgp and MRP2 showed a similar expression pattern along the human intestine as for CYP3A4. The gene expression of MRP1 exhibited a more uniform distribution.', 8590278: 'Blood-retinal barrier (BRB) and blood-aqueous barrier (BAB) permeability were assessed by various methods to clarify conflicting reports on whether blood-retinal barrier permeability changes occur in diabetic and galactose-fed rats and to assess the potential role of aldose reductase in this process. Different molecular weight probes were utilized in rats fed for 7-11 months either a normal diet or a diet containing 50% galactose with/without the aldose reductase inhibitor AI1576 or Ponalrestat. BRB and BAB were assessed through radiolabelled sucrose permeability studies in eyes where the anterior segment was frozen during dissection compared to eyes where the anterior segments were not frozen and by quantitative autoradiography. In addition, histological studies using Evans Blue dye, microperoxidase and horseradish peroxidase were conducted. In untreated galactose-fed rats a 4-fold increase in the mean permeability surface area product (PA) to sucrose at the BRB was observed when the aqueous humor was not frozen during retinal dissection. However, no increase in the mean PA to sucrose was observed when the aqueous humor of similar eyes was frozen during dissection. Similarly, no retinal vessel permeability increase was observed by either quantitative autoradiography of [3H]-sucrose after 15 minutes of circulation or histological studies with microperoxidase, horseradish peroxidase or Evans Blue dye. Examination of the BAB revealed an increase in the permeability of iris vessels but not the ciliary body in galactose-fed rats which was reduced by treatment with the aldose reductase inhibitor AI1576. These data indicate that while BRB permeability is not increased in galactose-fed rats, BRB permeability measurements with isotopes are subject to possible contamination from the aqueous humor in untreated galactose-fed rats, which can result in false observations of increased BRB permeability.', 19725258: StringElement('Conflicting reports on prevalence of RLS exist in Asian countries due to differences in sampling strategies and assessment instruments.

The objective of this study is to determine whether there are gender differences in in-hospital mortality and angiographic findings of patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We conducted a prospective study of all patients admitted to University Hospital Center Split, Croatia with STEMI from 2004 to 2008 who underwent PCI. From March 2004 throughout September 2008, 488 patients with STEMI underwent PCI (364 men, 74.6%; 124 women, 25.4%). Compared with men, women were significantly older (mean age, 67.3 vs. 60.3 years; p < 0.001). Men had a significantly higher proportion of circumflex artery occlusion (19.5% vs. 10.5%, p = 0.022). A higher proportion of men had a multivessel disease than women (56.8% vs. 41.9%; p = 0.004). In-hospital mortality was significantly higher among women (11.3% vs. 4.6%; p = 0.002) but after adjustment for the baseline difference in age, the female sex was not an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (adjusted OR 1.15; 95% CI 0.82-1.84). In men, occlusions of left anterior descending artery showed higher mortality rate than occlusions of other coronary arteries (LM 0%, LAD 7.3%, Cx 2.8%, RCA 0.7%, p = 0.03).

Furthermore, looping formation may prevent a complete colonoscopy from being carried out in certain patients. The conventional colonoscope has not changed very much since its original introduction. We review promising technologies that are being promoted as a way to address the problems with current colonoscopy. There are some methods to prevent looping formation, including overtube, variable stiffness, computer-guided scopes, Aer-O-Scope, magnetic endoscopic imaging and the capsule endoscope. In recent years, with the progress of microelectromechanical and microelectronic technologies, many biomedical and robotic researchers are developing autonomous endoscopes with miniaturization of size and integration functionality that represent state of the art of the micro-robotic endoscope. The initial results by using aforementioned methods seem promising; however, there are some conflicting reports of clinical trials with the overtube colonoscope, the computer-guided scope and the variable stiffness colonoscope. There are also some limitations in the use of the Aer-o-scope and the capsule endoscope. The autonomous endoscope is based on a self-propelling property that is able to avoid looping completely.

There are conflicting reports for using a panel of serologic tests such as pepsinogens I, II (PG I and PG II), and gastrin for population screening. We designed this study to assess healthy appearing adults in Shiraz, southern Iran in order to evaluate the correlation of these serological tests with demographics and lifestyle in a region with a low rate of gastric malignancy. METHODS In a population-based study, 846 out of 1978 subjects who were selected by cluster random sampling based on postal code division in Shiraz agreed to participate in the present study. A questionnaire that included age, gender, weight and height, lifestyle such as physical activity, smoking and the use of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was completed. A blood sample was taken after overnight fasting for measurements of PG I, PG II and Cag A status by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA). Gastrin level was measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA). RESULTS The study included 305 men and 541 women. Their mean age was 50.53+11.4 (range: 35-99 years). The level of PG I was significantly more in males than females (116.6\\xb157.1 vs. 103.1\\xb155.8, p < 0.001), lower in older age groups (p = 0.01), and rural compared with urban residents (110.3+55.7 vs. 100.2+58.1, p = 0.02). The serum level of PG II was less in obese subjects (p = 0.5). There was no significant correlation between PG I, PG II, smoking, NSAID use and activity. Gastrin level were not correlated with any of the demographic characteristics. The level of Cag A was significantly different between males and females (30.5\\xb137 vs. 37.7\\xb141.7, p < 0.001), more in older subjects (p = 0.007) and non smokers (p = 0.001). The serum levels of PG I and PG I/PG II ratio decreased significantly in subjects with positive Cag A serology (p < 0.05). The ratio of PG I/PG II was lower than 3 in 35 (4.1%) subjects. CONCLUSION In this area, the PG I/PG II ratio is less than 3 in 4% of subjects of which most are positive for Cag A serology and older than 50.

The electronic bibliographic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Knowledge, Scopus, and Cochrane Library, and reference lists from relevant articles were searched for English-language publications describing randomized controlled trials of GnRH agonist pretreatment vs placebo or no treatment before laparoscopic myomectomy. Three studies including 168 participants were identified. Pretreatment with GnRH agonist did not reduce operative time; however, intraoperative blood loss was statistically lowered (mean difference, 60 mL; 95% confidence interval [CI], 39-82). Statistical difference was also observed in postoperative hemoglobin concentration (mean difference, 1.15 g/dL; 95% CI, 0.46-1.83]) and red blood cell count (mean difference, 0.65 \\xd7 10(6) cells/mL; 95% CI, 0.16-1.14]) but not serum iron concentration. None of the patients in the studies experienced any major intraoperative or postoperative complications, and only 1 patient in each group required blood transfusion. This study does not show a difference in operative time with GnRH agonist pretreatment, which clarifies the previous conflicting reports on the effect of GnRH agonist therapy on the duration of laparoscopic myomectomy. Furthermore, despite previously reported decreased bleeding conferred by the laparoscopic approach compared with laparotomy, this meta-analysis demonstrates a further reduction in intraoperative blood loss with GnRH agonist pretreatment in patients undergoing laparoscopic myomectomy.

However, the widespread application of TiO(2)-MOAC to biological samples is hampered by conflicting reports as to which experimental conditions are optimal. We have evaluated the performance of TiO(2)-MOAC under a wide range of loading and elution conditions. Loading and stringent washing of peptides with strongly acidic solutions ensured highly selective enrichment for phosphopeptides, with minimal carryover of non-phosphorylated peptides. Contrary to previous reports, the addition of glycolic acid to the loading solution was found to reduce specificity towards phosphopeptides. Base elution in ammonium hydroxide or ammonium phosphate provided optimal specificity and recovery of phosphorylated peptides. In contrast, elution with phosphoric acid gave incomplete recovery of phosphopeptides, whereas inclusion of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in the eluant introduced a bias against the recovery of multiply phosphorylated peptides. TiO(2)-MOAC was also found to be intolerant of many reagents commonly used as phosphatase inhibitors during protein purification. However, TiO(2)-MOAC showed higher specificity than immobilized gallium (Ga(3+)), immobilized iron (Fe(3+)), or zirconium dioxide (ZrO(2)) affinity chromatography for phosphopeptide enrichment. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) was more effective in detecting larger, multiply phosphorylated peptides than liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS/MS), which was more efficient for smaller, singly phosphorylated peptides.', 18304850: 'Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is a class of positional, geometric, conjugated dienoic isomers of linoleic acid. Dietary CLA supplementation has resulted in a dramatic decrease in body fat mass in mice. However, some but not all studies in mice and humans have found that CLA promoted insulin resistance, and there were conflicting reports on the effects of CLA on peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR gamma) activation and expression. The objective of present study was to investigate the effect of CLA on insulin resistance and its molecular mechanisms. Fifty male Wistar rats were randomly designed to the control, high-fat and high-fat with CLA (0.75, 1.50, and 3.00 g in per 100 g diet) groups. The effect of CLA on insulin sensitivity and the mechanism of resisting diabetes by CLA were investigated by RT-PCR assay. The results showed that supplementation with CLA significantly reduced body weight gain and white fat pad weight in the rats, the levels of plasma free fatty acids (FFA), triglycerides (TGs), cholesterin (TC), leptin, insulin and blood glucose concentration in the obese rats of CLA group were also decreased compared to the rats in the high-fat group. Dietary CLA increased the mRNA expression of PPAR gamma, fatty acid binding proteins (aP2), fatty acid transporter protein (FATP), acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) and adiponectin in the adipose tissues of obese rats. The results suggest that CLA may ameliorate insulin resistance by activating PPAR gamma, and increasing the expression of PPAR gamma target genes such as ap2, FATP, FAT, and adiponectin in the white adipose tissue.', 18422767: \"Chromosomal rearrangements play a causal role in haematological and mesenchymal malignancies.

Nuclear grade and tumor differentiation are established indicators; however, the interobserver lack of concordance has thwarted their use in clinical trials. The presence of peritumoral lymphatic and blood vessel invasion (PLBI) is associated with a relative risk of recurrence of 4.7. The predictive value of the presence of hormone receptors in tumors is associated with a favorable disease free and overall survival difference of 8-10%; however, this advantage is being eroded by the early appearance of other factors, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), proliferative capacity (S-phase), nuclear grade, and HER-2/neu oncogene. Concordance among the different methods of hormone-receptor assay (immunocytochemical, sucrose gradient, and dextran-coated charcoal) is essential to refine the true value of these factors. DNA flow cytometry measurements of ploidy (DNA content) and S-phase fraction are the most characterized of the prognostic factors. There are conflicting reports regarding the clinical significance of ploidy status, while measurements of S-phase fraction clearly indicate a robust association with disease free and overall survival. Our data continue to show that S-phase, but not ploidy, can predict time to recurrence significantly in untreated patients, even when data are stratified for tumor size. HER-2/neu oncogene is expressed in about 50% of ductal carcinoma in situ and 14% of invasive ductal carcinoma. The presence of this oncogene at high copy number may be a useful independent marker of poor prognosis and may be associated with drug resistance and correlated with tumor recurrence and shorter survival. EGFR could be measured in most breast tumors, and the level of its expression has inversely correlated with estrogen receptor protein expression. The value of EGFR as a predictor of prognosis remains controversial and is still being investigated. Cathepsin-D provides a provocative biologic rationale but is hindered by different and incongruent methods of analysis. The majority of large studies with more than 3-years\\' follow-up suggests that high cathepsin-D levels may be predictive of greater recurrence and lower survival.

The single deaminase domain APOBEC3H (A3H) enzyme is highly polymorphic and multiple A3H haplotypes have been identified. A3H haplotype II (A3H-hapII) possesses the strongest activity against HIV-1. There remains, however, uncertainty regarding the extent to which A3H-hapII is sensitive to HIV-1 Vif mediated degradation. We tested, therefore, the two different reference Vif proteins widely used in previous studies. We show that A3H-hapII is resistant to NL4-3 Vif while it is efficiently degraded by LAI Vif. Co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that LAI Vif, but not NL4-3 Vif associates with A3H-hapII. Chimeras between NL4-3 and LAI Vif identify the amino acid responsible for the differential degradation activity: A histidine at position 48 in Vif confers activity against A3H-hapII, while an asparagine abolishes its anti-A3H activity. Furthermore, the amino acid identity at position 48 only affects the degradation of A3H-hapII, whereas recognition of and activity against human A3D, A3F and A3G are only minimally affected. NL4-3 encoding 48H replicates better than NL4-3 WT (48N) in T cell-lines stably expressing A3H hapII, whereas there is no fitness difference in the absence of APOBEC3. These studies provide an explanation for the conflicting reports regarding A3H resistance to Vif mediated degradation.', 15006730: 'Recent mechanistic studies on the role of heat-shock proteins (HSPs) to induce innate and adaptive immune responses have resulted in conflicting reports.

To understand the actual function of HSPs in their interaction with the immune system, methods and procedures need to be optimised and appropriate controls need to be used. These points should also clarify the conflicting findings about HSPs and promote our knowledge about other immuologically important components that may be present in HSP preparations.', 3173390: \"Gossypol has potential for widespread use as a male oral antifertility agent in humans since it appears to be highly efficacious, with reversible spermatostatic effects and minimal side effects.

Individual analyses revealed only one donor with a significant SCE response (p less than 0.001). In subsequent experiments, exposure at higher doses had no effect on SCE frequencies. A small but significant increase in SCE was observed in ficoll/hypaque purified lymphocytes exposed to 0.07 and 0.70 microM gossypol acetic acid.

We suggest that the inconsistencies in the literature can be explained by the method used to identify regions that respond to words. Here we provide evidence that the \"visual word form area\" (VWFA) shows word selectivity when identified at the individual subject level, but that intersubject variability in the location and size of the VWFA causes this selectivity to be washed out if defining the VWFA at the group level or based on coordinates from the literature. Our findings confirm the existence of a word-selective region in vOT while providing an explanation for why other studies have found a lack of word specificity in vOT.', 23999507: 'Ocular comfort agents are molecules that relieve ocular discomfort by augmenting characteristics of the tear film to stabilize and retain tear volume and lubricate the ocular surface. While a number of clinical comparisons between ocular comfort agent solutions are available, very little work has been done correlating the properties of specific comfort agents (species, molecular weight, and water retention) and solution properties (concentration, viscosity, zero shear viscosity, and surface tension) to the performance and effectiveness of comfort agent solutions. In this work, comfort-promoting properties related strongly to comfort agent concentration and molecular weight, the first objective demonstration of this relationship across diverse comfort agent species and molecular weights. The comfort agents with the greatest comfort property contributions (independent of specific molecular weight and concentration considerations) were hyaluronic acid (HA), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), respectively. The observed, empirical relationships between comfort property contribution and comfort agent species, solution properties, comfort agent molecular weight, and solution concentration was used to develop novel comfort agent index values. The comfort agent index values provided much insight and understanding into the results of experimental studies and/or clinical trials and offer potential resolution to numerous conflicting reports within the literature by accounting for the difference in comfort agent performance due to molecular weight and concentration of comfort agents. The index values provide the first objective, experimental validation and explanation of numerous general trends suggested by clinical data.', 11699224: 'Prospective clinical studies including large numbers of patients have led to the conclusion that co-expression of myeloid antigens in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (My+ ALL) does not have prognostic significance. However, reports of the frequency of My+ ALL in children vary widely across laboratories using different mAb clones and staining and analysing procedures. Taking two commonly accepted thresholds of positivity for myeloid antigens (20 and 30%), we analysed the immunoreactivity of the most widely employed mAb clones against CD13 (SJ1D1, L138 and My7) and CD33 (My9, P67.6 and D3HL60) and compared the proportions of My+ ALL detected by these clones in childhood ALL. The correlation between myeloid antigen expression and the presence of the t(12;21) translocation was analysed concomitantly in the same samples. The percentage of ALL cases positive for myeloid markers varied significantly depending on the mAb clone and the positive threshold. Among patients with B-ALL, the proportion of CD13+ ALL was significantly lower using SJ1D1 than using L138 or My7, while the proportion of CD33+ ALL was significantly higher for My9 than for P67.6 or D3HL60. Analysis of the co-expression of CD13 and CD33 on B-ALL cells using combinations of mAb clones showed that this frequency was either underestimated by the SJ1D1/D3HL60 or overestimated by the L138/P67.6 and My7/My9 combinations. A correlation between CD13/CD33 positivity and the t(12;21) translocation was uniformly observed in B-ALL patients for a positive threshold of 30%, whereas SJ1D1/D3HL60 detected no correlation between t(12;21) and CD13/CD33 positivity when the threshold was lowered to 20%. These data show that the mAb clones commonly used to detect the CD13 and CD33 surface antigens have variable immunoreactivity against childhood ALL cells, which may partly explain the conflicting reports concerning the prognostic significance of myeloid antigen expression in paediatric ALL and its association with different translocations. The present findings may also be of clinical importance for therapeutic choices.', 14752796: StringElement('Little is known about the aetiology of primary bone tumours.

There has been no review of the available literature, and conflicting reports of diagnostic accuracy have prevented routine use of transthoracic Doppler in graft patency assessment. Thus, this article reviews the available literature on diagnostic accuracy of transthoracic Doppler echocardiography of coronary bypass grafts. Relevant studies were identified and meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy was performed. Study quality was assessed. Quantitative data synthesis included calculation of sensitivity, specificity, summary receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, pooled analysis and meta-regression of accuracy against study quality, publication date, angina, probe frequency and diagnostic criteria. Twenty studies of 929 patients produced 26 results included for analysis. Grafts were not visualized in 93 (10%) patients. Pooled sensitivity (85%) and specificity (94%) and diagnostic odds ratio (100.7) were high. SROC analysis showed an area under the curve of 0.96. Heterogeneity of results was due to variations in diagnostic criteria and study size. Subgroup analysis showed best performance in patients with postoperative angina (p = 0.014). Study quality did not affect results. Diastolic fraction less than 0.5 (sensitivity 89%, specificity 94%) was shown to be the best criterion for prediction of stenosis. Performance was lower using peak diastolic to systolic velocity ratio less than 1 (sensitivity 85%, specificity 86%). Transthoracic Doppler echography is effective in first-line assessment of left internal thoracic artery graft patency. It shows high specificity, prevents invasive investigations and improves in patients with postoperative angina. TDE is best used in combination with other non-invasive tests due to its inability to visualize the graft. The potential for use in postoperative coronary bypass patients is high.', 10798132: 'The Eutectic Mixture of Local Anesthetics (EMLA) is a topical application, which has proved to be a useful medication for providing pain relief among children. It is an emulsion containing a 1:1 mixture of lidocaine and prilocaine. The high concentration of the uncharged anesthetic base in the microdroplets of the emulsion ensure effective skin penetration. In the pediatric population EMLA has been shown to be efficacious when it is used prior to venipuncture, cannulation, lumbar puncture, laser treatment of port wine stains, curettage of molluscum contagiosum or vaccination. For several of these indications, the efficacy has been documented by double blind controlled trials, that have used objective and quasi-objective scales for assessing pain relief. The dose of EMLA is between 0.5 to 1 gram, and the cream should be applied half to one hour prior to the procedure. Local side effects are very mild, and the only systemic side effect of importance is the risk of methemoglobinemia in young infants. The literature has conflicting reports about the safety of EMLA in neonates.', 6597686: 'Intravenous diazepam is commonly used in clinical dentistry to produce sedation for dental procedures. Its chief benefit seems to derive from its sedative and amnesic properties. The literature contains conflicting reports about the direct analgesic effects of the drug. In the present study, we observed significant increases for conventional pain threshold measures in response to electric tooth pulp stimulation and decreased sensitivity to a fixed painful stimulus when diazepam was administered intravenously using clinical criteria for conscious sedative dosages. The data support the possibility that intravenously administered diazepam in conscious sedative doses may have some analgesic action in addition to its better documented sedative and amnesic properties.', 9616439: StringElement('Durable healing of full-thickness articular cartilage defects has been considered for a long time as a highly desirable, but unlikely event to occur.

The receptor specificity of these alpha subunits is unknown. G alpha q and G alpha 11 are ubiquitously expressed in tissues; however, there have been conflicting reports of the presence or absence of G alpha 11 protein in haematopoietic cells. Platelet thromboxane A2/prostaglandin H2 (TXA2/PGH2) receptors activate PI-PLC via G alpha q, but the role of G alpha 11 is uncertain. To define their roles in platelet activation we studied G alpha q and G alpha 11 gene expression by immunotransfer blotting and by reverse transcription of mRNA followed by PCR (RT-PCR) and direct sequencing. An antiserum specific for mouse G alpha 11 failed to identify G alpha 11 in dog or human platelets or in dog liver, a tissue known to contain G alpha 11. RT-PCR performed with gene-specific primers demonstrated G alpha q mRNA, but not G alpha 11 mRNA, in normal human and mouse platelets and in thromboxane-sensitive and thromboxane-insensitive dog platelets. Studies of mouse and dog liver and human retina confirmed that the cDNA, primers and probes used could amplify and recognize G alpha 11 in other tissues. However, species-specific oligonucleotide primers and probes were essential to demonstrate G alpha 11, but not G alpha q, mRNA. Compared with mouse cDNA, dog and human G alpha 11 cDNA had twice as many nucleotide substitutions (approx. 12% compared with approx. 6%) as G alpha q, G alpha q mRNA was also found in mature erythrocytes but G alpha 11 mRNA was not identified, whereas both G alpha q and G alpha 11 mRNAs were found in bone marrow stem cells. Therefore G alpha 11 gene expression in haematopoietic cells is linked with cellular differentiation. The lack of G alpha 11 indicates that signal transduction from platelet TXA2/PGH2 receptors to PI-PLC occurs via G alpha q, and that G alpha 11 deficiency is not responsible for defective activation of PI-PLC in thromboxane-insensitive dog platelets. Despite the high degree of similarity that exists between G alpha q and G alpha 11, significantly greater species-specific variation in nucleotide sequence is present in G alpha 11 than in G alpha q. Cellular specificity and species specificity are important characteristics of these Gq family G-proteins.', 15014969: 'We have developed an imprinting assay combining the use of mice carrying maternal or paternal duplication of chromosomal regions of interest with custom oligonucleotide microarrays. As a model system, we analyzed RNA from CNS tissue of neonatal mice carrying the reciprocal translocation T(7;15)9H and uniparental duplication of proximal Chr 7 and 15. The duplicated region includes the locus on proximal Chr 7 corresponding to the human Prader-Willi/Angelman Syndrome. The microarray contained 322 oligonucleotides, including probes to detect major genes involved in neural excitability and synaptic transmission, as well as known imprinted genes mapping to proximal Chr 7: Ndn, Snrpn, Mkrn3, Magel2, Peg3, and Ube3a. Imprinting of these genes in neonatal cortex and cerebellum was first confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. Their inclusion on the microarray thus provided positive controls for evaluating the effect of background on the sensitivity of the assay, and for establishing the minimum level of expression required to detect imprinting. Our analysis extended previous work by revealing bi-allelic expression in CNS tissue of those queried genes mapping to proximal Chr 7 or 15, including the Gabrb3 gene, for which there have been conflicting reports. Microarray analysis also revealed no effect of the maternal or paternal disomy on expression levels of the unlinked genes detected, including those potentially implicated in the Prader-Willi or Angelman Syndrome. In addition, quantitative RT-PCR revealed a gene dosage effect in both cerebellum and cortex for all of the known imprinted genes assayed, except for Ube3a in cerebellum.', 7734331: 'Cocaine is reported to produce either periportal or mid-zonal necrosis in mice pretreated with the enzyme inducer phenobarbitone (James et al. 1987; Powell et al. 1991; Charles & Powell 1992). Dose-response and time course experiments were performed in phenobarbitone treated male DBA/2Ha mice to study the pathogenesis of this unusual cocaine induced lesion. An increase in the dose of cocaine from 60 to 90 or 120 mg/kg produced more extensive and severe periportal and linking portal damage and elevated plasma aspartate (AST) and alanine (ALT) aminotransferases in a dose dependent manner. Scattered hepatocyte degeneration began at the edge of the periportal region and was detectable by electron microscopy within 30 minutes of administration of 60 mg/kg of cocaine, with conspicuous disorganization of the endoplasmic reticulum being one of the earliest changes. Significant elevations of plasma AST and ALT were observed 3 hours after cocaine administration and were sustained for 12 hours, at which time progressive hepatocyte damage had developed into a network of confluent necrosis at the periphery of the periportal region. The rapidity of organelle derangement and subsequent cell death, and absence of any effect on total cytochrome P-450 or FAD-mono-oxygenase levels, appear to distinguish this periportal lesion from previous reports of cocaine induced centrilobular necrosis in non-enzyme induced mice, suggesting that the two types of damage may develop by different mechanisms. The observation that periportal lesions commence at the periphery of the periportal area, progressing portalwards with increasing dose and time, offers an explanation for the previously conflicting reports of cocaine induced mid-zonal and/or periportal lesions in phenobarbitone treated mice.', 28032061: StringElement('There is conflicting reports on the respiratory health effects of indoor risk factor exposure.

Human cytomegalovirus infection was first recognized in its congenital disseminated form and, subsequently, in a subclinical form. In 1968, the first temporal bone demonstration of endolabyrinthine infection was reported. To date, there have been reports made on only nine temporal bones in infants with HCMV infection. The light microscopic findings, in general, have been similar, with cytomegalovirus inclusion-bearing cells involving the nonneuroepithelial cells in both the cochlear and vestibular endolabyrinth. A few cases have been studied with fluorescent antibody methods, but have resulted in conflicting reports regarding the presence of virus in cells of the organ of Corti and spiral ganglia. Subclinical congenital HCMV infection, including labyrinthine infection, has also been studied. Only two groups have performed major prospective studies along with systematic and careful periodic audiologic evaluation in cytomegalovirus congenitally infected children. Their findings demonstrated significant hearing loss in 33% to 48% of symptomatic patients and in 6.9% to 13% of asymptomatic children. There also was evidence of progressive hearing loss in some of these children. Vestibular dysfunction is less well characterized. The long-term sequelae may include Meniere's syndrome. Acquired HCMV infection in children and adults has not been demonstrated histopathologically, although it has been associated with sudden deafness and acute labyrinthitis.

Patients suspected of having heart failure can be selected for further investigations on the basis of having an elevated plasma concentration of N-ANP, BNP, and N-BNP. High levels of cardiac hormones identify those at greatest risk for future serious cardiovascular events. Moreover, adjusting heart failure treatment to reduce plasma levels of N-BNP may improve outcome. Cardiac hormones are most useful clinically as a rule-out test. In acutely symptomatic patients, a very high negative predictive value is coupled with a relatively high positive predictive value. Measurement of cardiac hormones in patients with heart failure may reduce the need for hospitalizations and for more expensive investigations such as echocardiography. However, there have also been conflicting reports on the diagnostic value of cardiac hormones, they are not specific for any disease, and the magnitude of the effects of age and gender on BNP in the normal subgroup suggests that these parameters need to be considered when interpreting cardiac hormone levels.', 11418694: 'IL-2 responses are susceptible to suppression by TGFbeta, a cytokine widely implicated in suppression of inflammatory responses and secreted by many different tumor cell types. There have been conflicting reports regarding inhibition of IL-2-induced STAT3 and STAT5 phosphorylation by TGFbeta and subsequent suppression of immune responses. Using TGFbeta-producing multiple myeloma tumor cells we demonstrate that tumor-derived TGFbeta can block IL-2-induced proliferation and STAT3 and STAT5 phosphorylation in T cells. High affinity IL-2R expression was required for the suppression of IL-2 responses as a novel CD25(-) T cell line proliferated and phosphorylated STAT3 when cultured with tumor cells or rTGFbeta1. Activating T cells with IL-15, which does not use the high affinity IL-2R, completely restored the ability of T cells to phosphorylate STAT3 and STAT5 when cultured with tumor cells. IL-15-treated T cells proliferated normally when cocultured with tumor cells or rTGFbeta1, whereas IL-2 responses were consistently inhibited. Preincubation with IL-15 also restored the ability of T cells to respond to IL-2 by phosphorylating STAT3 and STAT5, and proliferating normally in the presence of tumor cells. IL-2 pretreatment did not restore T cell function. IL-15 also restored T cell responses by T cells from multiple myeloma patients, and against freshly isolated bone marrow tumor samples. Thus, activation of T cells by IL-15 renders T cells resistant to suppression by TGFbeta1-producing tumor cells and rTGFbeta1. This finding may be exploited in the design of new immunotherapy approaches that will rely on T cells avoiding tumor-induced suppression.', 17472585: 'The balance of intracellular cholesterol has proven to be critical to the production of beta-amyloid (A beta). Reducing cholesterol in vitro leads to decreased production of A beta, whereas an increase in cellular cholesterol induces A beta production. Liver X Receptor (LXR) agonists are known to increase cholesterol efflux from cells, but there are conflicting reports as to the effects of these agonists on A beta production. We therefore examined the effects of efflux-inducing agents on A beta production in vitro. We used methyl-beta-cyclodextrin and an LXR agonist (TO-901317) to induce cholesterol efflux and studied the resulting A beta production in a stable amyloid precursor protein (APP) -transfected cell line. When cholesterol efflux was induced with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin there was a >60% decrease in A beta(40) and A beta(42) production. However, while activation of LXR using TO-901317-induced cholesterol efflux in the presence of a cholesterol acceptor, no changes in A beta levels were recorded. When cells were incubated with TO-901317 above the concentration required for maximal cholesterol efflux, there was a 150% increase in A beta(42) levels. The absence of a cholesterol acceptor from the culture media (preventing cholesterol efflux) did not blunt this increase in A beta(42), suggesting that the effects of TO-901317 on A beta(42) are efflux independent. These results were confirmed in APP stably transfected human H4 cells, which revealed in addition to a 200% increase in A beta(42) levels, a concomitant 80% reduction in A beta(38). A cell-free gamma-secretase assay confirmed that TO-901317 can directly alter gamma-secretase activity. These data demonstrate that TO-901317 can directly modulate the site of cleavage of APP by gamma-secretase in vitro.', 12194894: 'Lyme disease is a relatively well-described infectious disease with multisystem manifestations. Because of confusion over conflicting reports, anxiety related to vulnerability to disease, and sensationalized and inaccurate lay media coverage, a new syndrome, \"chronic Lyme disease,\" has become established. Chronic Lyme disease is the most recent in a continuing series of \"medically unexplained symptoms\" syndromes. These syndromes, such as fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, and multiple chemical sensitivity, meet the need for a societally and morally acceptable explanation for ill-defined symptoms in the absence of objective physical and laboratory findings. We describe factors involved in the psychopathogenesis of chronic Lyme disease and focus on the confusion and insecurity these patients feel, which gives rise to an inability to adequately formulate and articulate their health concerns and to deal adequately with their medical needs, a state of disorganization termed aporia.', 21857805: 'The evolution of heteromorphic sex chromosomes (e.g., XY in males or ZW in females) has repeatedly elicited the evolution of two kinds of chromosome-specific regulation: dosage compensation--the equalization of X chromosome gene expression in males and females--and meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI)--the transcriptional silencing and heterochromatinization of the X during meiosis in the male (or Z in the female) germline. How the X chromosome is regulated in the Drosophila melanogaster male germline is unclear. Here we report three new findings concerning gene expression from the X in Drosophila testes. First, X chromosome-wide dosage compensation appears to be absent from most of the Drosophila male germline. Second, microarray analysis provides no evidence for X chromosome-specific inactivation during meiosis. Third, we confirm the previous discovery that the expression of transgene reporters driven by autosomal spermatogenesis-specific promoters is strongly reduced when inserted on the X chromosome versus the autosomes; but we show that this chromosomal difference in expression is established in premeiotic cells and persists in meiotic cells. The magnitude of the X-autosome difference in transgene expression cannot be explained by the absence of dosage compensation, suggesting that a previously unrecognized mechanism limits expression from the X during spermatogenesis in Drosophila. These findings help to resolve several previously conflicting reports and have implications for patterns of genome evolution and speciation in Drosophila.', 27444304: u'There are conflicting reports on the heavy metal levels in human semen with different fertilities. The purpose of this analysis is to merge and analyze the differences of heavy metal lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), zinc (Zn), and copper (Cu) levels in male semen with normal and low fertilities.

In an attempt to clarify the situation, two groups of healthy subjects undertook a progressive exercise test either daily (Group A) or weekly (Group B) on 10 separate occasions. Breathlessness was estimated every 1 min using the VAS. After 10 occasions, both Group A (P <0.05) and Group B ( P <0.01) showed a significant increase in the mean intercept of the breathlessness/ventilation (VAS/ V (I)) relationship. The increase was not progressive; using change point regression, reproducible values were found to occur after approximately the fifth occasion in both subject groups. As the slope of the VAS/ V (I) relationship was highly reproducible and did not change with repeat testing, it would appear that at least two mechanisms are involved in the generation of the sensation of breathlessness. A decrease in the exercise heart rate over the same time period was significantly correlated with changes in the VAS/ V (I) intercept in both groups (P <0.01 and P <0.005 respectively). The relationship is unlikely to be causal, but may be indicative of a common underlying mechanism. It is suggested that breathlessness scores are likely to decrease as a direct result of repetitive testing over, on average, the first five periods of assessment. On the basis of this study, it may be inferred that a physiological mechanism contributes to the modulation of breathlessness during repetitive exercise testing.', 4285534: 'Buckler, Charles E. (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Md.), and Samuel Baron. Antiviral action of mouse interferon in heterologous cells. J. Bacteriol. 91:231-235. 1966.-The antiviral action of mouse interferon in cell cultures of mouse, hamster, rat, chicken, and monkey origin was investigated. Using a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) plaque reduction test, we found that mouse serum interferon, assayed on closely related rat or hamster cells, exerted 5% of its homologous antiviral activity. This activity was characterized as interferon by its temperature of inactivation, trypsin sensitivity, nonsedimentability, stability at pH 2, lack of inactivation by antibody to virus, and inability to be washed off cells. In the more distantly related chicken and monkey cells, mouse interferon had less than 0.1% of its homologous activity. Conflicting reports of heterologous activity of chicken and mouse interferon preparations may result in part from the observed action of noninterferon inhibitors of vaccinia virus. These inhibitors, like interferon, are stable at pH 2. They are present in mouse serum, mouse lung extracts, and allantoic fluid, and they prevent the development of vaccinia plaques when allowed to remain in contact with cells during virus growth. Unlike interferon the inhibitors are removed by adequate washing of cells prior to virus challenge, and they are not active in the VSV assay system. These findings reemphasize the need for thorough characterization of interferon preparations.', 9167371: StringElement('There have been conflicting reports about the usefulness of topical pharyngeal anesthesia as a pre-endoscopic medication.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'BACKGROUND', u'Label': u'BACKGROUND'}), 1533027: StringElement('To reconcile conflicting reports of antibiotic efficacy for otitis media with effusion in children.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'OBJECTIVE', u'Label': u'OBJECTIVE'}), 16843878: \"Although serologic testing for perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (pANCA) and anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) is reportedly useful in distinguishing ulcerative colitis (UC) from Crohn's disease (CD), there are few and conflicting reports assessing their utility in predicting postoperative complications after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA). We examined the associations between postoperative complications such as pouchitis or fistulas and pANCA and ASCA antibodies in a group of patients who underwent IPAA for UC. We conducted a retrospective chart review of 34 patients initially diagnosed with UC (four of these patients had a diagnosis of indeterminate colitis) who underwent IPAA by a single surgeon, and who had pANCA and ASCA antibody levels measured during their clinical course. Study patients were assigned to four groups based on the pattern of antibody reactivity: pANCA+/ASCA- (16 patients), pANCA-/ASCA+ (nine patients), pANCA+/ASCA+ (five patients), and pANCA-/ASCA- (four patients). The median length of follow-up was 16 months (3-144 months). None of the patients (0 of 16) who were pANCA+/ASCA- had their preoperative diagnosis of UC changed after a median follow-up of 14 months (3-118 months). Of the nine patients with a preoperative diagnosis of UC who were pANCA-/ASCA+, four patients (44%) had their diagnosis changed postoperatively to CD based on clinical findings, with a median follow-up: 15 months (5-98 months). Of 16 patients who underwent IPAA and who were pANCA+/ASCA-, 15 of 16 (93.75%), were free of fistulas postoperatively, with a median follow-up of 14 months (3-118 months). Of nine patients with a preoperative diagnosis of UC who underwent IPAA and who were pANCA-/ASCA+, four of nine (44%; p = 0.04) developed fistulas postoperatively, with a median length of follow-up of 55 months (15-67 months). No relationship between serologic profiles or antibody titer levels and the development of pouchitis was identified. In a cohort of patients undergoing IPAA for UC, serologic profiles may be useful in identifying patients at risk of postoperative fistula formation. Patients who were pANCA-/ASCA+ were at increased risk for the development of fistulas postoperatively compared to patients who were pANCA+/ASCA-, and were also more likely to have their diagnosis changed postoperatively to CD.

Taken together these findings strongly suggest that the C3 binding in AITP is specifically related to the disease process.', 3683442: 'There are conflicting reports on the effect of exogenous thymidine (dThd) on the frequency of sister-chromatid exchanges (SCEs) in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Thymidine has been reported either to increase or to have no effect on SCE frequency under similar experimental conditions. To resolve this controversy, we have carried out a series of experiments to examine the effect of dThd on CHO cells cultured with 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd). In addition, we have examined the effect of dThd on CHO cells cultured with 5-chlorodeoxyuridine (CldUrd), a much more potent inducer of SCEs than BrdUrd. The addition of 100 microM dThd to the culture medium caused a consistent decrease in the yield of SCEs in cells grown in BrdUrd for two cell cycles. The decrease was even greater when cells were grown in dThd and CldUrd. Analysis of twin and single SCEs indicated that dThd must be present during the first cell cycle to reduce the frequency of SCEs. Because excess dThd is thought to have an effect when DNA replicates on a template substituted with a halogenated nucleoside, dThd at concentrations from 100 microM to 9 mM was added to cultures for the second cell cycle after a first cell cycle in BrdUrd. In this experiment, the presence of dThd increased SCE frequency in a dose-dependent manner. The results suggest that if dThd competes with halogenated nucleosides and thus decreases their incorporation into DNA, SCEs are suppressed in the subsequent cell cycle, whereas if excess dThd creates a dNTP pool imbalance, SCEs can be increased.', 23561334: StringElement('Despite advances made in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT), graft versus host disease (GvHD) remains a major problem.

Here, we performed a side-by-side comparison of different methods currently being used in the field to measure ADCC responses to HIV-1. We found that assays which are unable to differentiate virus-infected from uninfected cells greatly overestimate ADCC responses mediated by antibodies to CD4i epitopes and underestimate responses mediated by broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs).

Controlling the survival and proliferation of this pathogen in the ruminant gut could offer a measure of protection in the short term, and ultimately complement alternative biotechnological based solutions. Normally, E. coli is greatly outnumbered in the ruminant gut by anaerobic bacteria, producers of weak acids inhibitory to the growth of this species. Withdrawal of feed prior to animal slaughter reduces the concentration of these acids in the gut and may be accompanied by the proliferation of E. coli. There are conflicting reports concerning the effects of changes in the ruminant diet upon faecal shedding of E. coli O157. It is contended that it is important to identify animal husbandry methods or feed additives that may be accompanied by an increased risk of proliferation of this pathogen.

We took blood on 69 patients with Tourette syndrome and 72 age- and sex-matched tic-free controls. Laboratory staff were blind to the diagnostic status of the subjects. Evidence of recent streptococcal infection was defined using antistreptolysin titers. Anti-basal ganglia antibodies were determined using human basal ganglia sections. Statistical analysis was conducted using analysis of variance and chi-square tests. Raised antistreptolysin titers were found in 41 of 69 (59%) patients with Tourette syndrome and 14 of 72 (19%) controls (P = .000). Positive anti-basal ganglia antibodies were found in 22 of 69 (32%) subjects with Tourette syndrome compared with 7 of 72 (10%) controls, which was also significant (P = .002).

Recently, Salivirus has been frequently detected in acute gastroenteritis patients, suggesting its possible aetiological role. Conflicting reports available on disease association of Salivirus have made it difficult to ascertain their causative role. The overall epidemiology and clinical features of Salivirus infections are poorly understood. The present five year study was undertaken to investigate the presence and genetic diversity of Salivirus in acute gastroenteritis cases from Pune, Western India and to determine the clinico-epidemiological features of Salivirus infections. A total of 985 faecal samples (778 acute gastroenteritis and 207 asymptomatic controls), collected from three local hospitals (Jan2007-Dec2011) were examined for the presence of Salivirus by RT-PCR. Molecular characterization was performed by PCR amplification of the 3D and VP regions. Frequency of Salivirus detection in cases (2.6%) and controls (1.93%) was not significantly different (p = 0.57). Co-infection with other enteric viruses was seen in 50% of the cases. Comparison of clinical features between Salivirus mono and mixed infections revealed that Salivirus alone did not exacerbate gastroenteritis. The frequency of diarrhoea and overall clinical severity of mixed infections was significantly greater than mono infections (p = 0.02). Based on clinical findings, our study suggests that Salivirus does not cause severe gastroenteritis. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that study strains belonged to Salivirus A1 and formed 2 distinct clusters which shared nucleotide identities of 94.1-96.2% and 88.9-93.8% between themselves in 3D and VP regions, respectively. Interestingly, the more divergent Cluster2 strains shared a low nucleotide identity with the closest reference strain in both regions (~95% in 3D and ~92% in VP) suggesting that they could represent a variant type of Salivirus A1. The genetic diversity in strains detected from study region, emphasizes the need for Salivirus surveillance from other regions of India.', 8800107: StringElement('We sought to prospectively investigate whether genetic variation at the angiotensin-converting enzyme gene locus defined by an insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism influences the risk of myocardial infarction or prognosis after infarction, or both.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'OBJECTIVE', u'Label': u'OBJECTIVES'}), 25267332: UnicodeElement(u'Immune responses to therapeutic factor\\xa0VIII remain a major problem, affecting 30% of patients with severe hemophilia\\xa0A.

To study the influence of a particulate antigen on Th1/Th2 cell differentiation during the immune response to another antigen, we analysed the immune response to tetanus toxoid (soluble antigen) in BALB/c mice immunized with one of the three following vaccines: tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (DT), or DT associated with whole-cell Bordetella pertussis or its soluble antigens (DTPw and DTPa, respectively). Similar total antibody levels were observed for all vaccines. DT vaccine showed a higher IgG1/IgG2a ratio than the similar values observed for DTPw and DTPa vaccines. DT- and DTPa-primed spleen cells showed a Th2 (IL-5) profile while a Th1/Th2 (IFN gamma, IL-5) profile was observed for DTPw. IL-6 was only produced by DTPw-primed cells. Besides, IL-12 levels induced by DTPw were three times higher than the ones induced by both DT and DTPa. Our findings indicate that whole-cell B. pertussis priming modifies the tetanus immune response from Th2 to Th1/Th2 type probably via inflammatory mechanisms. In addition, in the light of conflicting reports regarding the mechanisms of protection induced by DTP vaccines, we studied the pertussis immune response. Only DTPw immunization generated memory T cells capable of proliferating with B. pertussis as an in vitro stimulus. Results might indicate that these cells may not play a key role in protecting against B. pertussis when the host is vaccinated with DTPa.', 20153482: \"Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can modulate cortical excitability and activation and consequently may affect clinical symptoms in neurological conditions characterized by altered motor cortex functions.

Recent studies have questioned the positive effects of Sir2 on lifespan inDrosophila. Several studies have shown that increased expression of the Drosophila Sir2 homolog (dSir2) extends life span while other studies have reported no effect on life span or suggested that increased dSir2 expression was cytotoxic. To attempt to reconcile the differences in these observed effects of dSir2 on Drosophila life span, we hypothesized that a critical level of dSir2 may be necessary to mediate life span extension. Using approaches that allow us to titrate dSir2 expression, we describe here a strong dose-dependent effect of dSir2 on life span. Using the two transgenic dSir2 lines that were reported not to extend life span, we are able to show significant life span extension when dSir2 expression is induced between 2 and 5-fold. However, higher levels decrease life span and can induce cellular toxicity, manifested by increased expression of the JNK-signaling molecule Puc phosphatase and induction of dnaJ-H. Our results help to resolve the apparently conflicting reports by demonstrating that the effects of increased dSir2 expression on life span in Drosophila are dependent upon dSir2 dosage.', 20659341: StringElement('Patients with early stage papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), are faced with the decision to either to accept or reject adjuvant radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment after thryroidectomy.

Guided by structural and functional analysis, we successfully engineered A3BCD2 to gain over two orders of magnitude higher activity for mC deamination.

By use of cross-linking, high resolution polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotting for 3H-labeled keratins or with an anti-mouse keratin 10 antibody, it was found that individual keratin chains form type I or type II homodimers and homotetramers in solution that do not assemble into KIF in vitro. When mixed in urea solutions of 5 M or greater, such homo-oligomers rapidly rearrange into mostly heterodimers and heterotetramers that support filament assembly. On the other hand, prekeratin, isolated from newborn mouse epidermis with 0.1 M sodium citrate buffer, pH 2.6, under conditions that do not dissociate the native coiled-coil molecule, consists exclusively of type I-II heterodimers and heterotetramers. It is necessary to dissolve prekeratin in 8-9.5 M urea for several hours in order to dissociate the native heterodimer molecule and incorporate tracer amounts of a single 3H-labeled keratin chain. These data establish that native KIF consist of heterodimer coiled-coil molecules. Furthermore, heterodimers are much more stable than homodimers and are the favored form of association in solution. However, some homodimers (10-30% of total) always form after dissolution in concentrated urea and can be assimilated into KIF during reassembly in vitro. The isolation of alpha-helix-enriched dimer particles from the 2B region of the rod domains upon limited proteolysis confirmed the presence of mostly heterodimer and some homodimer molecules in reassembled KIF. These properties of keratin chains in urea solutions hereby clarify a number of conflicting reports in the literature concerning the composition of the coiled-coil molecule. The presence of some homo-oligomeric species in reassembled KIF correlates with earlier observations of polymorphism as well as stoichiometry.', 20491462: 'The structure of a short fragment of the human HIV-1 membrane glycoprotein gp41 has been examined using a combination of parallel tempering molecular dynamics (PTMD) and far UV circular dichroism spectroscopy.

For many years, the contribution from a second region of the neuraxis (the sacral neural crest) to the ENS has been less clear, with conflicting reports appearing in the literature. To resolve this longstanding issue, we documented the spatiotemporal migration and differentiation of vagal and sacral-derived NCC within the developing chick embryo using quail-chick grafting and antibody labelling. Results showed that vagal NCC colonised the entire length of the gut in a rostrocaudal direction. The hindgut, the region of the gastrointestinal tract most frequently affected in developmental disorders, was found to be colonised in a complex manner. Vagal NCC initially migrated within the submucosa, internal to the circular muscle layer, before colonising the myenteric plexus region. In contrast, sacral NCC, which colonised the hindgut in a caudorostral direction, were primarily located in the myenteric plexus region from where they subsequently migrated to the submucosa. We also observed that sacral NCC migrated into the hindgut in significant numbers only after vagal-derived cells had colonised the entire length of the gut. This suggested that to participate in ENS formation, sacral cells may require an interaction with vagal-derived cells, or with factors or signalling molecules released by them or their progeny. To investigate this possible inter-relationship, we ablated sections of vagal neural crest (NC) to prevent the rostrocaudal migration of ENS precursors and, thus, create an aganglionic hindgut model. In the same NC ablated animals, quail-chick sacral NC grafts were performed. In the absence of vagal-derived ganglia, sacral NCC migrated and differentiated in an apparently normal manner. Although the numbers of sacral cells within the hindgut was slightly higher in the absence of vagal-derived cells, the increase was not sufficient to compensate for the lack of enteric ganglia. As vagal NCC appear to be more invasive than sacral NCC, since they colonise the entire length of the gut, we investigated the ability of transplanted vagal cells to colonise the hindgut by grafting the vagal NC into the sacral region. We found that when transplanted, vagal cells retained their invasive capacity and migrated into the hindgut in large numbers. Although sacral-derived cells normally contribute a relatively small number of precursors to the post-umbilical gut, many heterotopic vagal cells were found within the hindgut enteric plexuses at much earlier stages of development than normal.

It has been suggested that a theory of mind deficit may account for some of the abnormalities in interpersonal behaviour that characterize patients affected by behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. However, there are conflicting reports as to whether understanding someone else's mind is a key difference between behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and other neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. Literature data on the relationship between theory of mind abilities and executive functions are also contradictory. These disparities may be due to underestimation of the fractionation within theory of mind components. A recent theoretical framework suggests that taking someone else's mental perspective requires two distinct processes: inferring someone else's belief and inhibiting one's own belief, with involvement of the temporoparietal and right frontal cortices, respectively. Therefore, we performed a neuropsychological and neuroimaging study to investigate the hypothesis whereby distinct cognitive deficits could impair theory of mind reasoning in patients with Alzheimer's disease and patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. We used a three-option false belief task to assess theory of mind components in 11 patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, 12 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 20 healthy elderly control subjects. The patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and those with Alzheimer's disease were matched for age, gender, education and global cognitive impairment. [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography imaging was used to investigate neural correlates of theory of mind reasoning deficits. Performance in the three-option false belief task revealed differential impairments in the components of theory of mind reasoning; patients with Alzheimer's disease had a predominant deficit in inferring someone else's belief, whereas patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia were selectively impaired in inhibiting their own mental perspective. Moreover, inhibiting one's own perspective was strongly correlated with inhibition in a Stroop task but not with other subprocesses of executive functions. This finding suggests that self-perspective inhibition may depend on cognitive processes that are not specific to the social domain. Last, the severity of the deficit in inferring someone else's beliefs correlated significantly over all subjects with hypometabolism in the left temporoparietal junction, whereas the severity of the deficit in self-perspective inhibition correlated significantly with hypometabolism in the right lateral prefrontal cortex. In conclusion, our findings provided clinical and imaging evidence to support differential deficits in two components of theory of mind reasoning (subserved by distinct brain regions) in patients with Alzheimer's disease and patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia.\", 7535813: 'There has been a number of conflicting reports regarding the T lymphocyte chemotactic activities of several cytokines. IL-2 and IFN-gamma are known to promote augmentation of immune inflammation, whereas IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 display immunomodulatory effects on inflammatory cells including inhibition of cytokine production. Their effects on chemotaxis of inflammatory cells are unknown. We observed that IL-1 alpha could induce chemotaxis both in overnight cultured and anti-CD3 mAb-activated T lymphocytes and that overnight culture and anti-CD3 activation increase the number of IL-1R on T lymphocytes. In contrast, IL-8 selectively attracts freshly isolated T lymphocytes. Staurosporine inhibits freshly isolated T lymphocyte chemotaxis toward IL-8, whereas tyrphostin 23 inhibits chemotaxis of overnight cultured and anti-CD3-activated T lymphocytes toward IL-1 alpha. We have found that IL-2 and IL-13 inhibit the chemotactic migration of both CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes toward IL-8, and RANTES. IL-4 inhibits only CD8+ T lymphocyte chemotaxis toward RANTES, IL-8 and IL-10. IL-10 inhibits only CD4+ T lymphocytes in their chemotactic response toward RANTES and IL-8. IFN-gamma does on the other hand augment the sensitivity of human T lymphocytes to chemotactic stimuli. Thus, our results demonstrate that different proinflammatory cytokines will induce chemotactic migration of T lymphocytes under different circumstances acting through different signaling pathways. The T cell-derived cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 are able to block further T lymphocyte chemotaxis, thus leading to a focusing of T lymphocytes in an area of T lymphocyte activation.

We characterized the kinetics of yeast cell growth, sugar consumption, and ethanol production during maltose or maltotriose utilization by several S. cerevisiae yeast strains (both MAL constitutive and MAL inducible) and by their isogenic counterparts with specific deletions of the AGT1 gene. Our results clearly showed that yeast strains carrying functional permeases encoded by the MAL21, MAL31, and/or MAL41 gene in their plasma membranes were unable to utilize maltotriose. While both high- and low-affinity transport activities were responsible for maltose uptake from the medium, in the case of maltotriose, the only low-affinity (K(m), 36 +/- 2 mM) transport activity was mediated by the AGT1 permease. In conclusion, the AGT1 transporter is required for efficient maltotriose fermentation by S. cerevisiae yeasts, highlighting the importance of this permease for breeding and/or selection programs aimed at improving sluggish maltotriose fermentations.', 22913912: 'Extended work hours, interrupted sleep, and shift work are integral parts of medical training among all specialties. The need for 24-hour patient care coverage and economic factors have resulted in prolonged work hours for resident physicians. This has traditionally been thought to enhance medical educational experience. These long and erratic work hours lead to acute and chronic sleep deprivation and poor sleep quality, resulting in numerous adverse consequences. Impairments may occur in several domains, including attention, cognition, motor skills, and mood. Resident performance, professionalism, safety, and well-being are affected by sleep deprivation, causing potentially adverse implications for patient care. Studies have shown adverse health consequences, motor vehicle accidents, increased alcohol and medication use, and serious medical errors to occur in association with both sleep deprivation and shift work. Resident work hour limitations have been mandated by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education in response to patient safety concerns. Studies evaluating the impact of these regulations on resident physicians have generated conflicting reports on patient outcomes, demonstrating only a modest increase in sleep duration for resident physicians, along with negative perceptions regarding their education. This literature review summarizes research on the effects of sleep deprivation and shift work, and examines current literature on the impact of recent work hour limitations on resident physicians and patient-related outcomes.', 29576404: StringElement('There are conflicting reports about outcomes after infrainguinal bypass for chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) in patients with diabetes.

There are conflicting reports regarding its efficacy as a bronchodilator. The aim of this study was to examine whether nebulized GTN has bronchodilating effects in patients with acute bronchial asthma. We studied 18 patients (five female, 13 male) who were admitted to the hospital with acute severe asthma on two occasions, administering either 6 mg nebulized GTN or placebo (saline) in a double-blind, randomized, crossover fashion. Bronchial response was assessed by measurement of peak expiratory flow (PEF), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC). A systematic effect of this dose of GTN was demonstrated by a mean increase in heart rate of 38.1% (SEM=7.6%) after GTN administration from supine to erect posture, compared with 10.2% (SEM=1.8%) after placebo (P<0.005). Systolic blood pressure decreased by 8.7% (SEM=1.1%) after GTN, compared with 4.0% (SEM=2.1%) after placebo (P<0.05). Diastolic blood pressure did not change significantly. Baseline PEF, FEV1 and FVC did not differ on the two experimental days; however, acute bronchodilating effects were seen: PEF (l/min); 368 (21) pre-GTN, 411 (22) post-GTN and 384 (23) post-placebo (P<0.001). FEV1 (l); 2.12 (0.13) pre-GTN, 2.46 (0.15) post-GTN and 2.25 (0.16) post-placebo (P<0.001). FVC (l); 3.31 (0.17) pre-GTN, 3.75 (0.2) post-GTN and 3.54 (0.2) post-placebo (P<0.001). In conclusions, nebulized GTN has bronchodilating effects in patients with acute bronchial asthma. The exact mechanism of bronchodilation is not known, but it may be due to local effect on bronchial smooth muscles through nitric oxide or by systemic vasodilatation which leads to a decrease in pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance, or an increase in systemic catecholamine release.', 11896022: 'Plasma levels of corticosterone (B) respond acutely to exercise in all mammals that have been studied, but the literature contains conflicting reports regarding how chronic activity alters this response. We measured acute and chronic effects of voluntary activity on B in a novel animal model, mice selectively bred for high voluntary wheel running. Female mice were housed with or without wheels for 8 wk beginning at 26 days of age. Wheel-access selection mice had significantly higher B at night 8, day 15, and night 29, compared with wheel-access controls. Elevation of B was an acute effect of voluntary exercise. When adjusted for running in the previous 20 min, no difference between wheel-access selection and control animals remained. No training effect on B response was observed. These results are among the strongest evidence that, in some animals, the acute B response is unaffected by chronic voluntary exercise. In mice without wheels, selection mice had significantly higher B than controls at day 15, night 29, and night 50, suggesting that selection resulted in a modulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Growth over the first 4 wk of treatment was significantly and inversely related to average night B levels within each of the four treatment groups.', 1705176: 'Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is capable of both stimulating an in vitro lymphoproliferative response and augmenting non-major-histocompatibility-complex-(MHC)-restricted cytotoxicity. However, there are conflicting reports about the phenotypes of responding cells. In the present studies, we determined phenotypes of Ficoll/Hypaque-separated peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with 50, 100 or 1000 U/ml IL-2; analyses were performed after 1, 3 and 5 weeks. With all concentrations, there was a progressive increase in CD3+ cells: after 3-5 weeks more than 90% of the cells reacted with this antibody. However, the proportions of CD4+ and CD8+ cells proved to be a function of the IL-2 concentration. Cultures containing 50 U/ml or 100 U/ml favored the expansion of the CD4+ subset. By contrast, in cultures stimulated with 1000 U/ml. CD8+ cells predominated. At baseline, CD8+ cells comprised 28 +/- 2%; after 3 weeks, this value increased to 51 +/- 5%. In addition, the proportion of CD56+ (Leu19, NKH-1) cells depended on the amount of IL-2. At 50 U/ml, there was no appreciable change in CD56+ cells. However, at 1000 U/ml, CD56+ cells increased from 17 +/- 1% (day 0) to 39 +/- 4% (3 weeks). This increase was primarily due to an expansion of the CD3+ CD56+ subset (non-NMC restricted cytotoxic T cells). By contrast, natural killer (NK) cells, as measured by the CD16 antibody, steadily declined at all IL-2 concentrations.', 25889317: StringElement('Madin Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells form polarized epithelium in vitro and are routinely used in research fields ranging from protein trafficking to influenza.

There have been conflicting reports about the detection and significance of expression of p21ras protein in human breast disease as determined by immunohistochemistry. The antibody Y13-259, which detects a single protein of Mr 21,000, has been applied immunohistochemically to frozen sections of normal, benign proliferative breast, fibroadenomas, and carcinomas. Uniform staining of normal breast epithelium and myoepithelium was found, with occasional stronger staining in areas of epithelial hyperplasia in benign breast disease. Contrary to previous reports, decreased expression, usually heterogeneous, was found in half of the carcinomas examined. Thirty per cent of the carcinomas exhibited heterogeneous staining stronger than that of normal breast, interpreted as increased expression of p21ras protein. This did not relate to tumour grade or node status but showed a significant correlation with proliferation rate as determined by the monoclonal antibody Ki-67. This study confirms previous reports that p21ras protein expression is a feature of normal cells, and has identified increased expression in 30 per cent of tumours associated with higher proliferation rates, which is a lower incidence than previously claimed when a different antibody was employed.', 22580450: 'Autophagy is a membrane-trafficking process that delivers cytoplasmic constituents to lysosomes for degradation. It contributes to energy and organelle homeostasis and the preservation of proteome and genome integrity. Although a role in cancer is unquestionable, there are conflicting reports that autophagy can be both oncogenic and tumor suppressive, perhaps indicating that autophagy has different roles at different stages of tumor development. In this report, we address the role of autophagy in a critical stage of cancer progression-tumor cell invasion. Using a glioma cell line containing an inducible shRNA that targets the essential autophagy gene Atg12, we show that autophagy inhibition does not affect cell viability, proliferation or migration but significantly reduces cellular invasion in a 3D organotypic model. These data indicate that autophagy may play a critical role in the benign to malignant transition that is also central to the initiation of metastasis.', 16606438: StringElement('We have previously linked HER4 expression with increased survival in breast cancer.

However, because GF is carcinogenic and teratogenic in animal models there is considerable concern regarding its clinical application. Further, it produces numerical chromosome aberrations in human lymphocytes and cell lines. There are conflicting reports on the ability of GF to induce structural chromosomal aberrations. Here, we show GF induces micronucleus formation both in isolated peripheral lymphocytes and lymphocytes from whole blood cultures. An antikinetochore antibody was used to distinguish micronuclei with acentric chromosome fragments (kinetochore-negative) and from those containing whole chromosomes (kinetochore-positive). The micronuclei formed were 99% kinetochore-positive in isolated lymphocytes. In addition, GF was able to alter the cell cycle kinetics of lymphocytes, thereby increasing the percentage of triploid cells. We conclude that GF is a strong aneuploidy-inducing agent in peripheral human lymphocytes and produces effects at concentrations which should be detectable in the blood of persons undergoing therapy.', 23284971: u\"\\u03b1-synuclein is thought to play a key role in Parkinson's disease (PD) because it is the major protein in Lewy bodies, and because its gene mutations, duplication, and triplication are associated with early-onset PD. There are conflicting reports as to whether serum and plasma concentrations of \\u03b1-synuclein and anti-\\u03b1-synuclein antibodies differ between PD and control subjects. The objectives of this study were to compare the levels of \\u03b1-synuclein and its antibodies between individuals with typical PD (n=14), atypical Parkinson syndromes (n=11), idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (n=10), and healthy controls (n=9), to assess the strength of association between these serum proteins, and to determine group sizes needed for a high probability (80% power) of detecting statistical significance for 25% or 50% differences between typical PD and control subjects for these measurements. Analysis of log-transformed data found no statistically significant differences between groups for either \\u03b1-synuclein or its antibodies. The concentrations of these proteins were weakly correlated (Spearman rho=0.16). In subjects with typical PD and atypical Parkinson syndromes, anti-\\u03b1-synuclein antibody levels above 1.5 \\xb5g/ml were detected only in subjects with no more than four years of clinical disease. Power analysis indicated that 236 and 73 samples per group would be required for an 80% probability that 25% and 50% differences, respectively, in mean \\u03b1-synuclein levels between typical PD and control subjects would be statistically significant; for anti-\\u03b1-synuclein antibodies, 283 and 87 samples per group would be required.

There are conflicting reports about the relationship between CAGn and clinical progression of HD. We conducted an analysis of data from the Coenzyme Q10 and Remacemide Evaluation in Huntington's Disease (CARE-HD) clinical trial. We modeled progression over 30 months on the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) and supplemental neuropsychological and behavioral tests using multiple linear regression. Mean subject age was 47.9 +/- 10.5 years and mean CAGn was 45.0 +/- 4.1. Multiple linear regression revealed statistically significant associations between CAGn and worsening on several motor, cognitive, and functional outcomes, but not behavioral outcomes. Many effects were clinically important; 10 additional CAG repeats were associated with an 81% increase in progression on the Independence Scale. These associations were not observed in the absence of age adjustment. Age at the time of assessment confounds the association between CAGn and progression. Adjusting for age shows that longer CAGn is associated with greater clinical progression of HD. This finding may account for the variable results from previous studies examining CAGn and progression. Adjusting for CAGn may be important for clinical trials.\", 27043071: 'African swine fever virus (ASFV) causes a lethal haemorrhagic disease of pigs. There are conflicting reports on the role of interferon in ASFV infection. We therefore analysed the interaction of ASFV with porcine interferon, in vivo and in vitro. Virulent ASFV induced biologically active IFN in the circulation of pigs from day 3-post infection, whereas low virulent OUR T88/3, which lacks genes from multigene family (MGF) 360 and MGF505, did not. Infection of porcine leucocytes enriched for dendritic cells, with ASFV, in vitro, induced high levels of interferon, suggesting a potential source of interferon in animals undergoing acute ASF. Replication of OUR T88/3, but not virulent viruses, was reduced in interferon pretreated macrophages and a recombinant virus lacking similar genes to those absent in OUR T88/3 was also inhibited. These findings suggest that as well as inhibiting the induction of interferon, MGF360 and MGF505 genes also enable ASFV to overcome the antiviral state.', 836864: 'There are conflicting reports concerning the number of distinct delta5-3-oxosteroid isomerases present in various steroid producing tissues; this problem was reexamined by two techniques: (1) kinetics measurements with a mixture of androst-5-ene-3,17-dione and pregn-5-en-3, 20-dione. (2) thermal inactivation of the androst-5-ene-3,17-dione isomerase and pregn-5-ene-3,20-dione isomerase activities. The results are the following: (a) Kinetic data support the concept of a single delta5-3-oxosteroid isomerase with a low substrate specificity in the microsomes. (b) Thermal inactivation experiments also support the one enzyme theory, but strongly suggest an heterogeneity of the delta5-3-oxosteroid isomerase in the bovine adrenocortical microsomes.

Two-dimensional STE is a relatively angle independent technology that can measure global and regional strain, strain rate, displacement, and velocity in longitudinal, radial, and circumferential directions. It can also quantify rotational movements such as rotation, twist, and torsion of the myocardium. Two-dimensional STE has been validated against hemodynamics, tissue Doppler, tagged magnetic resonance imaging, and sonomicrometry studies. Two-dimensional STE has been found clinically useful in the assessment of cardiac systolic and diastolic function as well as providing new insights in deciphering cardiac physiology and mechanics in cardiomyopathies, and identifying early subclinical changes in various pathologies. A large number of studies have evaluated the role of 2D STE in predicting response to cardiac resynchronization therapy in patients with severe heart failure. However, the clinical utility of 2D STE in the above mentioned conditions remains controversial because of conflicting reports from different studies. Emerging areas of application include prediction of rejection in heart transplant patients, early detection of cardiotoxicity in patients receiving chemotherapy for cancer, and effect of intracoronary injection of bone marrow stem cells on left ventricular function in patients with acute myocardial infarction. The emerging technique of three-dimensional STE may further extend its clinical usefulness.', 12072493: 'The presence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA-containing particles in the low-density fractions of plasma has been associated with high infectivity. However, the nature of circulating HCV particles and their association with immunoglobulins or lipoproteins as well as the characterization of cell entry have all been subject to conflicting reports. For a better analysis of HCV RNA-containing particles, we quantified HCV RNA in the low-density fractions of plasma corresponding to the very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) fractions from untreated chronically HCV-infected patients. HCV RNA was always found in at least one of these fractions and represented 8 to 95% of the total plasma HCV RNA. Surprisingly, immunoglobulins G and M were also found in the low-density fractions and could be used to purify the HCV RNA-containing particles (lipo-viro-particles [LVP]). Purified LVP were rich in triglycerides; contained at least apolipoprotein B, HCV RNA, and core protein; and appeared as large spherical particles with a diameter of more than 100 nm and with internal structures. Delipidation of these particles resulted in capsid-like structures recognized by anti-HCV core protein antibody. Purified LVP efficiently bind and enter hepatocyte cell lines, while serum or whole-density fractions do not. Binding of these particles was competed out by VLDL and LDL from noninfected donors and was blocked by anti-apolipoprotein B and E antibodies, whereas upregulation of the LDL receptor increased their internalization. These results suggest that the infectivity of LVP is mediated by endogenous proteins rather than by viral components providing a mechanism of escape from the humoral immune response.', 24472848: u'Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized for dysregulated intestinal inflammation. Conflicting reports have shown that activation of inflammasome could promote or decrease intestinal inflammation in an acute colitis model, whereas the involvement of inflammasome activation in chronic colitis is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the role of inflammasome activation in the development of chronic intestinal inflammation by utilizing interleukin-10 (IL-10) knockout (KO) mouse as an animal model, which develops chronic colitis resembling human IBD. We demonstrate the causative link between inflammasome activation and the development of chronic intestinal inflammation. Our results show that mature IL-1\\u03b2 protein levels were significantly increased in all colon sections from IL-10-deficient mice compared with that of wild-type mice. We found that inhibition of inflammasome activities with IL-1 receptor antagonist or caspase-1 inhibitors suppressed IL-1\\u03b2 and IL-17 production from inflamed colon explants. Furthermore, blocking inflammasome activation with caspase-1 inhibitor in vivo significantly ameliorated the spontaneous colitis in IL-10 KO mice.

The present studies have utilized two congenic strains of C57Bl/6 mice that differ only at this locus to assess its influence on TCDD-induced suppression of antibody responses. Mice were given a single oral dose of TCDD 2 days prior to challenge with sheep red blood cells (SRBC) or trinitrophenyl-lipopolysaccharide (TNP-LPS). The subsequent dose-dependent effects of TCDD on the amount of antibody produced by splenic plasma cells were measured using the hemolytic antibody isotope release assay. In addition, the relative importance of the Ah genotype of lymphoid versus nonlymphoid tissue was examined in adoptive transfer experiments. Aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) activity was significantly induced in Ahbb mice by a dose of 0.5 micrograms/kg TCDD and maximally induced by a dose of 2 micrograms/kg. Ahdd mice required 10-fold higher doses of TCDD to induce comparable levels of AHH. The degree of thymic involution and liver hypertrophy induced by TCDD was also influenced by the Ah genotype of the animals. Both Ahbb and Ahdd mice exhibited dose-dependent suppression of the anti-TNP response following TCDD exposure. The ID50 was 7.0 micrograms/kg in Ahbb mice and 30.8 micrograms/kg in Ahdd mice. Suppression of the antibody response to SRBC was also dependent on the Ah locus. The ID50 in Ahbb mice was 0.6 micrograms/kg TCDD. However, an apparent biphasic dose response for suppression of the anti-SRBC response in Ahdd mice suggested the involvement of an Ah-independent component of suppression as well. In adoptive transfer studies, lymphocytes were identified as an Ah-dependent component of the response. The Ah-independent component of the response was not identified, and could be either lymphoid or nonlymphoid in nature. The possibility that T helper cells represent the Ah-independent component is discussed.', 24925479: 'There is a considerable interest for the discovery and characterization of tumor-associated antigens, which may facilitate antibody-based pharmacodelivery strategies. Thrombospondin-1 and thrombospondin-2 are homologous secreted proteins, which have previously been reported to be overexpressed during remodeling typical for wound healing and tumor progression and to possibly play a functional role in cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis. To our knowledge, a complete immunohistochemical characterization of thrombospondins levels in normal rodent tissues has not been reported so far. Using antibody phage technology, we have generated and characterized monoclonal antibodies specific to murine thrombospondin-1 and thrombospondin-2, two antigens which share 62% aminoacid identity. An immunofluorescence analysis revealed that both antigens are virtually undetectable in normal mouse tissues, except for a weak staining of heart tissue by antibodies specific to thrombospondin-1. The analysis also showed that thrombospondin-1 was strongly expressed in 5/7 human tumors xenografted in nude mice, while it was only barely detectable in 3/8 murine tumors grafted in immunocompetent mice. By contrast, a high-affinity antibody to thrombospondin-2 revealed a much lower level of expression of this antigen in cancer specimens. Our analysis resolves ambiguities related to conflicting reports on thrombosponding expression in health and disease. Based on our findings, thrombospondin-1 (and not thrombospondin-2) may be considered as a target for antibody-based pharmacodelivery strategies, in consideration of its low expression in normal tissues and its upregulation in cancer.', 17825066: \"The teleomorphic basidiomycetous yeast Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous is important as a commercial source of astaxanthin, which is a component of feeds for mariculture. Phaffia rhodozyma is the anamorphic state of Xanthophyllomyces; however, there are conflicting reports in the literature concerning the presence of a sexual cycle in P. rhodozyma. The current study attempted to explain this enigma. Strains were obtained from the Phaff Yeast Culture Collection (University of California, Davis) and other sources in the northern hemisphere. Molecular sequences of three nuclear rDNA regions were examined: the internal transcribed spacers (ITS), intergenic spacer (IGS1) and the D1D2 region at the 5' end of the 26S gene. Different levels of genetic variability were observed in the three regions. The D1D2 differentiated major groups of strains, while an increased variability in the ITS suggested that the ITS region could be employed as an ecological marker. The greatest variability was in the IGS1 region, where strains can be defined by the presence and location of indels. Intragenomic sequence heterogeneity in the ITS and IGS1 regions led to the hypothesis that the type strain of P. rhodozyma (CBS 5905(T), UCD 67-210(T)) was derived as a mating-deficient basidiospore from the parent teleomorphic strain CBS 9090.\", 2970923: 'There are conflicting reports of platelet function abnormalities in diabetic patients without vascular complications. We have studied in vitro platelet aggregation, using platelet rich plasma and whole blood techniques, in 18 patients with uncomplicated insulin-dependent diabetes and a matched group of 24 non-diabetic subjects. In addition we measured plasma beta-thromboglobulin levels in these groups, as an index of in vivo platelet activation, and compared the indices of in vitro and in vivo platelet function before and after maximal bicycle exercise. Before exercise plasma beta-thromboglobulin levels and platelet sensitivities to ADP, collagen or adrenaline, as assessed by both methods of platelet aggregation, were the same in diabetic and control subjects. Both groups showed similar increases in beta-thromboglobulin levels and in platelet sensitivity to all agonists in whole blood following exercise. Using platelet rich plasma there were no changes in platelet sensitivity in either group after exercise. In non-diabetic subjects, increases in noradrenaline levels after exercise correlated with increases in platelet sensitivity to adrenaline in whole blood. This was not observed in the diabetic group.

There are, however, conflicting reports of the percentages of DRG neurons that express glutaminase (GLS), the enzyme that synthesizes glutamate, ranging from 30% to 100% of DRG neurons. Defining DRG neuron populations by the expression of proteins like GLS, which indicates function, is routinely accomplished with immunolabeling techniques. Proper characterization of DRG neuron populations relies on accurate detection of such antigens. It is known intuitively that fixation can alter immunoreactivity (IR). In this study, we compared the effects of five formaldehyde concentrations between 0.25% and 4.0% (w/v) and five picric acid concentrations between 0.0% and 0.8% (w/v) on the IR of GLS, the voltage-gated sodium channel 1.8 (Na(v)1.8), and the capsaicin receptor TRPV1. We also compared the effects of five incubation time lengths from 2 to 192 hr, in primary antiserum on IR. Lowering formaldehyde concentration elevated IR for all three antigens, while raising picric acid concentration increased Na(v)1.8 and TRPV1 IR. Increasing IR improved detection sensitivity, which led to higher percentages of labeled DRG neurons. By selecting fixation conditions that optimized IR, we found that all DRG neurons express GLS, 69% of neurons express Na(v)1.8, and 77% of neurons express TRPV1, indicating that some previous studies may have underestimated the percentages of DRG neurons expressing these proteins.

A comparison of experimental protocols identified two variables which might account for this inconsistency: the potential of the vector strain to colonize the murine gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and the nature of the foreign antigen subsequently delivered by the recombinant Salmonella construct. The former was investigated by constructing an aroA mutant of the Salmonella enterica serovar Stanley vector previously used in our laboratory. Although the introduction of an aroA mutation had surprisingly little effect on GALT colonization, it did reduce the strength of antilipopolysaccharide (anti-LPS) antibody responses and the impact of vector priming. Studies were also performed to ascertain the extent to which any observed hyporesponsiveness consequent upon vector priming might be determined by the characteristics of the foreign antigen. S. enterica serovar Stanley was used to deliver either of two Escherichia coli antigens, K88 pilus protein or the LT-B toxin subunit, to vector-primed mice. Both serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and intestinal IgA responses to K88 were completely abolished, and those to LT-B were significantly reduced, as a consequence of vector priming. When similar experiments were performed with an aroA S. enterica serovar Dublin vector, responses to K88 were significantly reduced but those to LT-B were unaffected by vector priming. Paradoxically, a priming infection with this vector induced stronger anti-LPS antibody responses but was less likely to elicit a state of hyporesponsiveness to subsequently presented foreign antigen. The impact of vector priming thus depends on both the Salmonella strain used and the nature of the foreign antigen, but our present data strengthen concerns that preexisting antivector immunity represents a serious threat to the Salmonella-based vaccine strategy.', 3608798: 'Ketoconazole, a nitrogen-substituted imidazole, has been shown to be a potent in vitro inhibitor of cytochrome P-450-mediated metabolic processes. Conflicting reports exist concerning the in vivo effect of ketoconazole on concomitantly administered drugs that require these metabolic processes for clearance. Therefore, the effect of multiple-dose ketoconazole on the elimination of theophylline, a drug metabolized by cytochrome P-450, in ten healthy, nonsmoking males (aged 18-40 years) was evaluated. Each subject received aminophylline 6 mg/kg iv before and at the end of seven days of ketoconazole 200 mg/d po. Theophylline serum concentrations were determined by fluorescence polarization immunoassay (TDx) at 12 time points over the 24-hour period following each infusion. No statistical difference (two-tailed t-test) in half-life (mean +/- SD 7.8 +/- 1.8 vs. 8.2 +/- 1.9 h) or clearance (0.797 +/- 0.201 vs. 0.722 +/- 0.133 ml/min/kg) could be demonstrated for theophylline before or after ketoconazole administration.

Given conflicting reports regarding the role of gender in dating violence, and the dearth of research examining the role of gender in relations between dating violence, sexual violence, and sexual risk taking, we also examine whether gender moderates the relation between these constructs. The findings indicate significant relationships among dating violence and FSI and age at first sex, number of sexual partners, and condom use across various ethnic groups. Findings also show that when controlling for gender, dating violence and FSI are related to number of sexual partners and age at first intercourse regardless of ethnic group identification.', 20841783: 'Hospitalized patients receive countless doses of medications through manually programmed infusion pumps. Many medication errors are the result of programming incorrect pump settings. When used appropriately, smart pumps have the potential to detect some programming errors.

In literature, there are conflicting reports regarding effect of food on the bioavailability of rifampicin. In vitro, effect of food on the bioavailability can be studied by simulating in vivo conditions in dissolution fluid hence, to understand the variable effect of food on rifampicin release, dissolution studies were done by simulating in vivo conditions after meal intake. In this study, we assessed the effect of hydrodynamic stress in presence of food and meal composition on two rifampicin containing fixed dose combination formulations by carrying out dissolution at different agitation rates (simulation of fasted and fed state) as well as in the presence of different percentage of oil (fatty food). Agitation intensity as well as presence of oil did not had any influence on rifampicin release from formulation A. This formulation had shown excellent release characteristics at all the conditions studied. Whereas, formulation B showed agitation rate dependent release and also release was affected in presence of oil. Hence, it is concluded that food may not have any effect on the release of rifampicin from the formulation and subsequently on its bioavailability if the formulation has excellent release profile (>85% release in 10 min). Further, effect of food on the rifampicin release was a function of dosage form characteristics such as disintegration time and dissolution rate, which will subsequently affect the release behavior of a formulation in presence of food.', 19588413: StringElement('Caesarean section delivery is becoming more frequent.

Implant placement after bone grafting provides the unique opportunity to biopsy and histologically evaluate new bone formation. Bone grafting of the mandible or maxilla was performed to fill extraction sockets and restore ridge structures in a consecutive series of eight patients. DBM prepared as malleable putty (Grafton DBM Putty) or flexible sheets (Grafton DBM Flex) was used. Biopsies were taken at reentry, and histologic analysis determined the amount and quality of regenerated bone. Extensive new bone formation and minimal residual bone graft matrix were observed at an average of 5 months postoperative.

Results from a survey of age at onset and age at death in 569 patients corroborate earlier findings of delayed onset of HD among offspring of affected mothers at both ends of the onset-age spectrum: 23 of 28 juvenile-onset offspring had affected fathers, and there were 1.6 times more late-onset offspring born to affected mothers than to affected fathers. These patterns, together with data that link age-at-onset variability to familial longevity trends, suggest a model where age at onset is governed, generally, by a set of independently inherited aging genes, but expression of the HD gene may be significantly delayed in individuals who possess a particular maternally transmitted factor.', 1487755: \"Abnormal levels of brain iron have been reported in parkinsonism, which is characterized principally by degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) nigrostriatal neurons. There are conflicting reports, however, of both increased and decreased iron in parkinsonism. An animal model of parkinsonism was used to clarify the contribution of the loss of nigrostriatal DAergic neurons to abnormal iron accumulations. In rats with 6-hydroxydopamine induced unilateral DA depletion, brain iron deposition and its day-to-day stability was studied in vivo using T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans taken on 4 consecutive days beginning 1-2 months post-surgery and post-mortem by Perls'-DAB histochemical stain. Unilateral DA depletion (parkinsonism model) produced large day-to-day fluctuations in T2 relaxation time in the striatum. The T2 relaxation time in Sham control rats was relatively minor. The uptake and transport of iron by intrinsic cells of the striatum may vary, and this variability may have been exaggerated by the destruction of DAergic nigrostriatal neurons, which are known to modulate the activity of the intrinsic cells. Inconsistent reports of increased or decreased iron in parkinsonism may reflect, in part, single time-point measures of widely fluctuating iron.\", 20602189: StringElement('As the number of breast cancer survivors increases, the long term consequences of breast cancer treatment are gaining attention.

Its causative and therapeutic relationships to calcium urolithiasis (CaUr) are controversial despite an association between low urinary Mg and CaUr. Recent studies have also found a tendency to low serum and/or lymphocyte Mg levels in CaUr. Despite earlier studies demonstrating an inhibitory effect of Mg supplementation on experimental CaUr in animals and in spontaneous CaUr in humans, at least two properly controlled clinical trials of Mg supplementation have failed to demonstrate a beneficial effect on CaUr frequency. With regard to the skeleton, experimental studies have shown that Mg depletion causes a decrease in both osteoblast and osteoclast activity with the development of a form of 'aplastic bone disease'. At the same time, bone salt crystallization is enhanced by Mg deficiency. Conversely, Mg excess impairs mineralization with the development of an osteomalacia-like picture, and may also stimulate bone resorption independently of parathyroid hormone. Whether or not Mg depletion may be a causal factor in human osteoporosis is also controversial, and there are conflicting reports as to the Mg content of osteoporotic bone. Small decreases in serum and/or erythrocyte Mg in osteoporotic patients have been reported, and one author has noted improved bone mineral density with a multinutrient supplement rich in Mg.

However, reports of the frequency of My+ ALL in children vary widely across laboratories using different mAb clones and staining and analysing procedures. Taking two commonly accepted thresholds of positivity for myeloid antigens (20 and 30%), we analysed the immunoreactivity of the most widely employed mAb clones against CD13 (SJ1D1, L138 and My7) and CD33 (My9, P67.6 and D3HL60) and compared the proportions of My+ ALL detected by these clones in childhood ALL. The correlation between myeloid antigen expression and the presence of the t(12;21) translocation was analysed concomitantly in the same samples. The percentage of ALL cases positive for myeloid markers varied significantly depending on the mAb clone and the positive threshold. Among patients with B-ALL, the proportion of CD13+ ALL was significantly lower using SJ1D1 than using L138 or My7, while the proportion of CD33+ ALL was significantly higher for My9 than for P67.6 or D3HL60. Analysis of the co-expression of CD13 and CD33 on B-ALL cells using combinations of mAb clones showed that this frequency was either underestimated by the SJ1D1/D3HL60 or overestimated by the L138/P67.6 and My7/My9 combinations. A correlation between CD13/CD33 positivity and the t(12;21) translocation was uniformly observed in B-ALL patients for a positive threshold of 30%, whereas SJ1D1/D3HL60 detected no correlation between t(12;21) and CD13/CD33 positivity when the threshold was lowered to 20%. These data show that the mAb clones commonly used to detect the CD13 and CD33 surface antigens have variable immunoreactivity against childhood ALL cells, which may partly explain the conflicting reports concerning the prognostic significance of myeloid antigen expression in paediatric ALL and its association with different translocations. The present findings may also be of clinical importance for therapeutic choices.', 8735631: '1. In this study, the effect of seven alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists (tamsulosin, phentolamine, prazosin, WB-4101, 5-methylurapidil, spiperone and HV723) have been examined on the contractile response to noradrenaline (NA) and phenylephrine (PE) in rat isolated aorta. 2. NA and PE, when administered using a cumulative dosing schedule, both produced concentration-dependent contraction of aortic rings. It was possible to fit the individual concentration-effect (E/[A]) curve data to the Hill equation to provide estimates of the curve midpoint location (p[A]50 = 7.74 +/- 0.10 and 7.14 +/- 0.18), midpoint slope (nH = 0.82 +/- 0.03 and 0.99 +/- 0.10) and upper asymptote (alpha = 3.2 +/- 0.3 and 3.1 +/- 0.2 g) parameters for NA and PE, respectively. However, the Hill equation provided a better fit to the E/[A] curve data obtained with another contractile agent, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) (p[A50] = 6.09 +/- 0.08, nH = 1.49 +/- 0.09, alpha = 2.6 +/- 0.3 g), as judged by calculation of the mean sum of squares of the differences between the observed and predicted values. 3. All of the antagonists investigated produced concentration-dependent inhibition of the contractile responses of the aorta to NA and PE. Although no significant effects on the upper asymptotes of the E/[A] curves of any of the antagonists tested were detected, only tamsulosin and 5-methylurapidil did not have a significant effect on the slope (nH) of the NA and PE E/[A] curves. The other antagonists produced significant steepening of the curves obtained with NA and/or PE. 4. Notwithstanding the fact that one of the basic criteria for simple competitive antagonism at a single receptor class was not always satisfied, the individual log [A]50 values estimated in the absence and presence of antagonist within each experiment were fitted to the competitive model. The Schild plot slope parameters for the antagonism of NA and PE by phentolamine and HV723 were found to be significantly less than unity. The Schild plot slope parameters for the other antagonists were not significantly different from unity. 5. In the absence of evidence to suggest that the deviations from simple competitive antagonism were due to failure to satisfy basic experimental conditions for quantitative analysis, an attempt was made to see whether the data could be accounted for by an existing two-receptor model (Furchgott, 1981). The goodness-of-fit obtained with the two-receptor model was significantly better than that obtained with the one-receptor model. Furthermore, with the exception of the data obtained with phentolamine, the pKB estimates for the two receptors were independent of whether NA or PE was used as agonist. 6. To determine which alpha 1-adrenoceptor subtypes may be associated with those defined by the two receptor model, the mean pKB estimates obtained from the two-receptor model fit were compared with affinities measured by Laz et al. (1994) for rat cloned alpha 1-adrenoceptor subtypes expressed in COS-7 cells. The sum of squared differences of the data points from the line of identity was smallest for both pKB1 and pKB2 in the case of the alpha 1a/d-adrenoceptor (now referred to as alpha 1d-adrenoceptor; Hieble et al., 1995). Therefore, the complexity exposed in this study may be due to the expression of closely-related forms of the alpha 1d-adrenoceptor. However, relatively good matches were also found between pKB1 and alpha 1c and between pKB2 and alpha 1b. Therefore, on the basis of these data, it is not possible to rule out the involvement of all three alpha 1-adrenoceptors. The conflicting reports concerning the characteristics of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor population mediating contraction of the rat aorta may, at least in part, be due to the lack of highly selective ligands and to between-assay variation in the expression of multiple alpha 1-adrenoceptors.', 26254697: StringElement('Recent molecular characterization studies focusing on bladder cancer have provided a wealth of information, including the identification of specific molecular subtypes of this disease.

In fact, conflicting reports exist regarding the role of Wnt/\\u03b2-catenin signalling during cardiomyogenesis. Here, we describe a dose-dependent and temporal effect of Wnt/\\u03b2-catenin signalling on in vitro cardiomyogenesis using embryonic stem cells (ESCs) as a model system. We could demonstrate that canonical Wnt activation during early stage of differentiation either through ligand or by GSK3\\u03b2 inhibition helped in maintaining Oct4 and Nanog expressions, and in parallel, it promoted mesoderm and endoderm inductions. In contrast, it led to attenuation in cardiomyogenesis that was reversed by moderate concentration of DKK1, but not soluble Fz8. However, higher DKK1 could also block cardiomyogenesis, suggesting thereby governance of a particular signalling threshold underlying this developmental event. Interestingly, Wnt signalling activation at early stage modulated BMP4 expression in a stage-specific manner. Wnt activation, synchronized with BMP4 and brachyury up-regulation at early stage, correlated well with mesoderm induction. Conversely, Wnt activation led to BMP4 and Wnt5a down-regulation at late stage culminating in cardiomyogenic attenuation. Our findings suggested the existence of precise regulatory machinery with context-dependent role of Wnt for fine tuning mesoderm induction and its derivatives, through establishment of Wnt gradient during ESCs' differentiation. Moreover, contrary to mere activation/inhibition, a specific threshold of Wnt and BMP and their synergy seemed necessary for providing the guiding cues in orchestrating mesoderm induction and subsequent cardiomyogenesis.\", 21587328: 'Opioid receptors are widely expressed in the central and peripheral nervous system and in the non-neuronal tissues. Data from animal and human clinical studies support the involvement of peripheral opioid receptors in analgesia, especially in the presence of inflammation. Inflammation has been shown to increase the synthesis of opioid receptors in the dorsal root ganglion neurons and enhance transport and accumulation of opioid receptors in the peripheral terminals of sensory neurons. Under the influence of chemokines and adhesion molecules, opioid peptide-containing immune cells extravasate and accumulate in the injured tissues. Stress, chemokines, cytokines, and other releasing factors in inflamed tissues stimulate these granulocytes to release opioid peptides. Once secreted, opioid peptides bind to and activate peripheral opioid receptors on sensory nerve fibers and produce analgesia by decreasing the excitability of sensory nerves and/or inhibiting release of pro-inflammatory neuropeptides. Research has revealed that local application of exogenous opioid agonists produces a potent analgesic effect by activating peripheral opioid receptors in inflamed tissues. The analgesic activity occurs without activation of opioid receptors in the central nervous system (CNS), and therefore centrally mediated side effects, such as respiratory depression, mental clouding, altered consciousness, or addiction, are not associated with peripheral opioid activity. This discovery has stimulated research on developing peripherally restricted opioid agonists that lack CNS effects. In addition, it has been recognized that opioid receptors modulate inflammation, and that opioids have anti-inflammatory effects. The anti-inflammatory actions of opioids are not well known or understood. Conflicting reports on mu-opioids suggest both anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory effects. This article will present the basis for peripheral opioid analgesia and describe current research directed at developing novel treatments for pain with improved side effect profiles.', 3345793: 'During the parent (P) into F1 hybrid graft-vs.-host reaction (GVHR), nuclear, leukocyte and erythrocyte autoantibodies are commonly seen. The specificity of these autoantibodies is reminiscent of those found in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients and SLE-prone mice. Organ-specific antibodies, however, including thyro-globulin (Tg) antibodies do not arise spontaneously. There have been conflicting reports about the ability of exogenous Tg to induce an anti-Tg response during the GVHR. We have re-examined this question in greater detail. Using the murine P----F1 GVHR system, the results of this work demonstrate that mouse thyroglobulin (MTg)-specific antibodies can be induced during a GVHR. However, mice must both be undergoing a GVHR, and have received exogenous MTg. The highest autoantibody response occurs if mice are injected with mouse thyroid extract or purified MTg at the time of P----F1 cell transfer. The anti-MTg response is MTg dose dependent. The ability to induce anti-MTg antibody was not major histocompatibility complex restricted, for both the DBA/2----B6D2F1 (low responder H-2 haplotypes to MTg), and AKR or DBA/2----AKD2F1 (high/low responder----high responder haplotype) GVHR gave similar responses. The anti-MTg titers peaked between days 7-10 and declined thereafter. In contrast, antibodies to dsDNA were not present at this early time, but developed after several weeks. We conclude that organ-specific autoantibodies can be induced during a GVHR if the appropriate antigen(s) are presented near the time of GVHR induction.', 26471811: 'Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a subtype of acute leukemia that is characterized by typical morphology, bleeding events and distinct chromosomal aberrations, usually the t(15;17)(q22;q21) translocation.

This observation implies, first, that motoneurons select the appropriate muscle nerve pathway and, second, that they restrict their ramification within the primary uncleaved muscle masses to appropriate regions. Several reports based on electrophysiology and orthograde horseradish peroxidase (HRP) labeling have shown muscle nerve pathway selection to be fairly precise. However, studies based on retrograde labeling with HRP have produced conflicting reports on the extent to which vertebrate motoneurons make projection errors. Since it is difficult to distinguish between true projection errors and HRP leakage when using retrograde labeling, we decided to assess the distribution of labeled growth cones in 25-micron serial plastic sections, following orthograde labeling of identifiable subpopulations of motoneurons during the period of initial axon outgrowth. Examination of a large number of muscle nerves revealed no segmentally inappropriate axons, confirming earlier reports that muscle nerve pathway selection is very accurate. In addition, we observed that growth cones take widely divergent trajectories into the same muscle nerve, suggesting that growth cones are responding independently to some specific environmental cue rather than being passively channeled at this point. The distribution of labeled growth cones within the muscle masses provided direct evidence that motoneurons did not at any time project to obviously inappropriate muscle regions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)', 21058954: StringElement('Recent transmissions of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease by blood transfusion emphasize the need for the development of prion screening tests.

Each of six independent observers was supplied with the same pair of records of 1 h of fasting diurnal duodenojejunal motility, acquired with a 3-channel ambulant data-logging system; one record included many artifacts due to body movement while the other did not. The observers were asked to identify and classify pressure events and to measure the duration and amplitude of \"true\" contractions. A computer program for on-line analysis is described; the algorithm was designed to overcome the problems of a variable baseline and sudden changes in pressure due to body movements that are unavoidable in prolonged recording from the small bowel of ambulant subjects. For regular contractions (phase III of migrating motor complex) there was good agreement between observers but not for irregular contractions, particularly when movement artifacts were abundant. When the observers were asked to repeat the analysis 6 mo later, there was poor agreement with their original identification of irregular contractions and artifacts. There was, however, good agreement between the computer analysis, which was totally reproducible, and the median decisions of the observer group; this agreement supports the validity of our computer algorithm. We conclude that computer analysis is not merely a valuable ergonomic aid for analysis of large quantity of data acquired in prolonged ambulatory monitoring, but also that, even for brief recordings, it provides a standard of reproducibility unmatched by \"expert\" inspection.

Cells that were grown under optimal, stressful, or differentiating conditions were exposed to cannabinoid agonists and then assayed for cell viability by measuring MTT, LDH, and caspase-3 activity. Various cannabinoid agonists (CP 55,940, \\u22069-THC, HU-210, and WIN 55,212-2) failed to affect cell viability when the cells were grown under optimal conditions. On the other hand, the same agonists significantly reduced cell viability when the cells were grown under stressful conditions (glucose- and serum-free medium), while enhancing the viability of cells grown in differentiation medium (0.5% serum and 1.5% DMSO). The toxic/protective profile was not dependent on the type or the concentration of the cannabinoid agonist that was applied. The cannabinoid agonist CP 55,940 similarly affected the non-neuronal HEK-293 cells that were grown under stressful conditions only when they expressed CB1 receptors. Our results shed light on the conflicting reports regarding the protective or toxic effects of cannabinoids in vitro and indicate that cannabinoids may activate different intracellular signaling mechanisms, depending on the state of the cell, thus leading to different physiological consequences.', 15588765: 'The role of p53 in modifying sensitivity to cytotoxic drugs has been commonly studied by creating transfection pairs of wt p53 parental cells and altered p53 daughter cells, or vice versa. Authors inevitably tended to extrapolate and generalize their experimental observations, and conflicting reports have been more the rule than the exception. We have performed a meta-analysis of 356 independent studies. Average changes of drug sensitivity after a change of p53 status were observed. E6 transfection predominantly induces sensitization to cytotoxic drugs, whereas p53-/- knockout cells are more drug-resistant than their normal p53+/+ counterpart. Unexpectedly, transfection with a mutated p53 does not change much the drug sensitivity of most wt p53 cancer lines, with the notable exception of A2780, a predominant cell line in the studies analyzed (A2780 cells show increased resistance after transfection with a mutated p53). Rather interestingly, mitotic spindle poisons acted differently from other classes of cytotoxic drugs. A crucial indication of our findings is that the role of p53 alone in determining sensitivity/resistance to cytotoxic drugs is limited: the individual molecular pathology and differentiation of a given cancer line prevail over any average trend, and are causal to a broad spreading of the data. We also identify major \"confounding factors\", alias independent categorical variables, capable of affecting the average outcome.', 25963934: u'The process of allogeneic HSCT in children is associated with frequent AKI and mortality, but the epidemiology is not widely reported. The aim of this review was to summarize the available evidence on incidence, risk factors, timing, and prognosis of AKI in children following HSCT. We systematically reviewed all observational studies reporting incidence and outcomes of AKI in pediatric allogenic HSCT recipients. The minimum criteria for AKI were defined as an increase in sCr \\u2265 x1.5 or urine output \\u22640.5 mL/kg/min over six h. Medline and Embase were searched until March 2014. From 993 electronic records, five were eligible for inclusion (n = 571 patients). The average incidence of AKI within the first 100 days following HSCT was 21.7% (range 11-42%), and the average time of onset was 4-6 wk post-transplant. Risk factors for AKI included cyclosporine toxicity, amphotericin B and foscarnet, SOS, and having a mismatched donor. There were conflicting reports on whether AKI was associated with the development of CKD. AKI is a common and potentially life-threatening complication following HSCT in children. Further quality observational studies are needed to accurately determine the epidemiology and prognosis of AKI in this population.', 27391391: StringElement('Conflicting reports on the efficacy of intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) incited us to evaluate the utility of IABP in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).', attributes={u'Label': u'BACKGROUND'}), 28506695: u'N822K(p\\xa0<\\xa00.001). Regarding signal transduction pathways, both KIT D816V and KIT N822K underwent autophosphorylation in the absence of growth factor. This was followed in KIT D816V by downstream activation of the SRC family kinase pathway in addition to the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway, and in KIT N822K by downstream activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in addition to the JAK/STAT pathway. These findings establish that D816V and N822K mutations are situated closely on the KIT receptor activation loop, but D816V has greater cell-proliferative and anti-apoptotic ability than N822K.', 18212270: 'The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a basic helix-loop-helix Per-Arnt-Sim transcription factor that mediates induction of metabolic enzymes and toxicity of certain environmental pollutants. Although AHR knockout (KO) mice develop cardiac hypertrophy, conflicting reports associate this pathology with hypotension or endothelin (ET)-1-dependent hypertension. Because hypertension occurred at modest altitude, we tested the hypothesis that loss of AHR increases the sensitivity to hypoxia-induced ET-1, contributing to systemic hypertension. We found that AHR KO mice were hypertensive at modest altitude (1632 m) but hypotensive at low altitude (225 m). When AHR KO mice residing at 1632 m were exposed to the partial pressure of inspired oxygen (PIO(2)) at sea level for 11 days, blood pressure declined to levels measured at 225 m. Although plasma ET-1 in AHR KO mice was significantly elevated at 1632 m and decreased at 225 m and sea level PIO(2), pulmonary prepro-ET-1 mRNA was significantly reduced at 1632 m and decreased further at 225 m and sea level PIO(2). Blood gas analysis revealed that AHR KO mice were hypoxemic, hypercapnic, and acidotic at 1632 m, values that were attenuated and normalized after 24 hours and 11 days under sea level PIO(2), respectively. Lastly, AHR inactivation in endothelial cells by small interfering RNA significantly reduced basal prepro-ET-1 mRNA but did not alter hypoxia-induced expression. Our studies establish the AHR KO mouse as a model in which modest decreases in PIO(2) lead to hypoxemia, increased plasma ET-1, and systemic hypertension without increased pulmonary prepro-ET-1 mRNA expression.', 9199024: 'With the increasing use of morphine, growing interest for the clinical implications of its metabolites, morphine-3-glucuronide (M-3-G) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M-6-G) has emerged in the literature. M-6-G binds to the opioid receptor and has analgesic properties in man. Clinical studies have not delivered strong evidence of significant correlation between the concentration of morphine and its glucuronides in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid and pharmacodynamics such as analgesia. There is no clinical evidence to indicate that M-6-G has a pronounced respiratory depressing effect in man, while the literature contains conflicting reports with regard to other side-effects. M-3-G does not bind to the m-opioid receptor and consequently has no antinociceptive effects. Studies in rodents have shown that morphine, M-6-G and especially M-3-G may induce hyperalgesia, allodynia and myoclonus. It is assumed that these side effects are caused by a spinal antiglycinergic mechanism. The role of M-3-G in morphine antagonism and development of tolerance has not yet been settled. As M-3-G and M-6-G are eliminated by the kidneys, renal insufficiency will lead to accumulation of these. Accordingly dosage should be reduced or other opioids be considered in such cases.', 11118001: 'There have been two previous conflicting reports that the development of T-cell-mediated autoimmune diabetes (type 1 diabetes) was respectively unaffected or inhibited in NOD mice genetically deficient in the T-helper (Th) 1 cytokine interferon (IFN)-gamma or the alpha-chain subunit of its receptor. Our goal was to resolve this conundrum by congenically transferring, from a 129 donor strain to the NOD background, a functionally inactivated gene for the beta-chain signaling (located on chromosome 16) rather than the alpha-chain ligand binding domain (located on chromosome 10) of the IFN-gamma receptor. These NOD.IFNgammaRBnull mice were characterized by normal patterns of leukocyte development and T-cells that produced greatly enhanced levels of the putatively type 1 diabetes-protective Th2 cytokine interleukin (IL)-4. However, despite being unable to respond to the primary Thl cytokine IFN-gamma and having T-cells that produce greatly enhanced levels of IL-4, NOD.IFNgammaRBnull mice remained highly susceptible to type 1 diabetes. This result indicated that the previously reported inhibition of type 1 diabetes in NOD mice carrying a functionally inactivated IFN-gamma receptor alpha-chain gene may have been due to a closely linked and previously unidentified diabetes resistance allele. Furthermore, our results indicate that the pathogenicity of diabetogenic T-cells in NOD mice is not dampened by an inability to respond to IFN-gamma and a concurrent shift to greatly enhanced Th2 cytokine production. This finding calls into question whether clinical protocols designed to shift beta-cell autoreactive T-cells from a Thl to Th2 cytokine production profile will truly be safe and efficacious in blocking the development of type 1 diabetes in humans.', 22169011: u'Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), known as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists, are used to treat type 2 diabetes. However, \\u223c5% of patients experience the treatment-limiting side effect of edema. Studies have implicated activation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) as a cause of TZD-induced fluid retention, although there have been conflicting reports. The goal of this study was to resolve the role of PPAR\\u03b3 in control of ENaC isoforms in the kidney. Herein, we demonstrate in mice that rosiglitazone (RGZ), a PPAR\\u03b3 ligand, increases body weight and abdominal fat pad fluid content and reduces hematocrit. Seven days of RGZ decreases ENaC\\u03b1 and ENaC\\u03b2 mRNA and ENaC\\u03b3 protein expression in the kidney cortex, and acute treatment for 5 h with pioglitazone, another potent TZD, does not increase renal ENaC isoform mRNA or protein expression. Pioglitazone also decreases ENaC\\u03b1 and ENaC\\u03b3 mRNA expression in a cortical collecting duct cell line. As no direct transcriptional studies had been conducted, we examined the PPAR\\u03b3-dependent regulation of ENaC. Pioglitazone represses ENaC\\u03b3 promoter activity, and this repression is partially relieved by inhibition of protein synthesis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that repression is associated with a decrease in histone H4K5 acetylation at the proximal ENaC\\u03b3 promoter. In summary, TZDs do not increase ENaC mRNA expression in the kidney, and in fact repress the ENaC\\u03b3 promoter via an indirect transcriptional mechanism.', 17126837: 'In rats, androgens in adulthood regulate the morphology of motoneurons in the spinal nucleus of the bulbocavernosus (SNB), including the size of their somata and the length of their dendrites. There are conflicting reports about whether androgens exert similar influences on SNB motoneurons in mice. We castrated or sham-operated C57BL6J mice at 90 days of age and, thirty days later, injected cholera toxin conjugated horseradish peroxidase into the bulbocavernosus muscle (to label SNB motoneurons) on one side, and into intrinsic foot muscles contralaterally (to label motoneurons of the retrodorsolateral nucleus (RDLN)). Castrated mice had significantly smaller SNB somas compared to sham-operated mice while there were no differences in soma size of RDLN motoneurons. Dendritic length in C57BL6J mice, estimated in 3-dimensions, also decreased significantly after adult castration. In rats, androgens act directly through androgen receptors (AR) in SNB motoneurons to control soma size and nearly all SNB motoneurons contain AR. Since SNB somata in C57BL6J mice shrank after adult castration, we used immunocytochemistry to characterize AR expression in SNB cells as well as motoneurons in the RDLN and dorsolateral nucleus (DLN). A pattern of labeling matched that seen previously in rats: the highest percentage of AR-immunoreactive motoneurons are in the SNB (98%), the lowest in the RDLN (25%) and an intermediate number in the DLN (78%). This pattern of AR labeling is consistent with the possibility that androgens also act directly on SNB motoneurons in mice to regulate soma size in mice.', 15179190: 'Melanoma is among the most chemotherapy-resistant malignancies. Numerous new agents have been developed that target specific molecules on cancer cells, including the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab, which targets Her2/neu and has been very beneficial in the treatment of breast cancer. There are conflicting reports in the literature about Her2/neu expression in melanoma specimens, but all of the cohorts studied have been small. We therefore examined Her2/neu expression in a very large cohort of melanoma specimens in order to determine the value of exploring trastuzumab therapy for melanoma patients. Immunohistochemical staining was performed on two tissue microarrays, together containing 600 intact specimens. Expression was evaluated semi-quantitatively and correlated with tumour stage and other clinicopathological data. Of the 600 specimens in the cohort, 31 patients (5.2%) had positive Her2/neu expression. Among the primary cutaneous specimens (n=269), 7% had positive Her2/neu staining, while 3.6% of the recurrent or metastatic specimens (n=331) had positive Her2/neu staining (P=0.06). Among the primary lesions there was no significant correlation between Her2/neu expression, Clark level and ulceration; however, Her2/neu expression was associated with lesions with a Breslow depth of < 2 mm (P=0.05). Using this very large cohort of melanoma specimens, we found only a few cases with aberrant Her2/neu expression, many of them being primary cutaneous lesions rather than recurrent or metastatic lesions. Our findings suggest that drugs that specifically target Her2/neu are not likely to be useful for the treatment of metastatic melanoma or as adjuvant therapy for melanoma patients at high risk for recurrence.', 11568568: StringElement('To reconcile conflicting reports and opinions of the value of preoperative coagulation studies for patients undergoing tonsillectomy.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'OBJECTIVE', u'Label': u'OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS'}), 19369401: 'In the mammalian liver, bile is transported to the intestine through an intricate network of bile ducts. Notch signaling is required for normal duct formation, but its mode of action has been unclear. Here, we show in mice that bile ducts arise through a novel mechanism of tubulogenesis involving sequential radial differentiation. Notch signaling is activated in a subset of liver progenitor cells fated to become ductal cells, and pathway activation is necessary for biliary fate. Notch signals are also required for bile duct morphogenesis, and activation of Notch signaling in the hepatic lobule promotes ectopic biliary differentiation and tubule formation in a dose-dependent manner. Remarkably, activation of Notch signaling in postnatal hepatocytes causes them to adopt a biliary fate through a process of reprogramming that recapitulates normal bile duct development. These results reconcile previous conflicting reports about the role of Notch during liver development and suggest that Notch acts by coordinating biliary differentiation and morphogenesis.', 6258107: 'A number of neurological disturbances occur during the treatment of childhood malignancies with cytotoxic drugs like vincristine, methotrexate, cytosine-arabinoside, cyclophosphamide, asparaginase and others.

Irradiation of the brain can produce transient or permanent brain damage by a direct effect on nervous tissue and by altering the blood brain barrier or the blood circulation. The many conflicting reports concerning the quality of life of long-term survivors of childhood leukaemia do not give sufficient data for final conclusions.

Using thiophosphorylated gizzard myosin, Sherry et al. [Sherry, J. M. F., Gorecka, A., Aksoy, M. O., Dabrowska, R., & Hartshorne, D. J. (1978) Biochemistry 17, 4417-4418] observed that the actin activation of ATPase was not inhibited by the removal of Ca2+. Hence, it was suggested that the regulation of actomyosin ATPase activity of gizzard myosin by calcium occurs only via phosphorylation. In the present study, phosphorylated and thiophosphorylated myosins were prepared free of kinase and phosphatase activity; hence, the ATPase activity could be measured at various concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+ without affecting the level of phosphorylation. The ATPase activity of myosin was activated either by skeletal muscle or by gizzard actin at various concentrations of Mg2+ and either at pCa 5 or at pCa 8. The activation was sensitive to Ca2+ at low Mg2+ concentrations with both actins. Tropomyosin potentiated the actin-activated ATPase activity at all Mg2+ and Ca2+ concentrations. The calcium sensitivity of phosphorylated and thiophosphorylated myosin reconstituted with actin and tropomyosin was most pronounced at a free Mg2+ concentration of about 3 mM. The binding of 125I-tropomyosin to actin showed that the calcium sensitivity of ATPase observed at low Mg2+ concentration is not due to a calcium-mediated binding of tropomyosin to F-actin. The actin activation of both myosins was insensitive to Ca2+ when the Mg2+ concentration was increased above 5 mM.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)', 11810244: 'There are conflicting reports regarding the cellular localization in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and filamentous fungi of homocitrate synthase, the first enzyme in the lysine biosynthetic pathway. The homocitrate synthase (HS) gene (lys1) of Penicillium chrysogenum was disrupted in three transformants (HS(-)) of the Wis 54-1255 pyrG strain. The three mutants named HS1(-), HS2(-) and HS3(-) all lacked homocitrate synthase activity and showed lysine auxotrophy, indicating that there is a single gene for homocitrate synthase in P. chrysogenum. The lys1 ORF was fused in frame to the gene for the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene of the jellyfish Aequorea victoria. Homocitrate synthase-deficient mutants transformed with a plasmid containing the lys1-GFP fusion recovered prototrophy and showed similar levels of homocitrate synthase activity to the parental strain Wis 54-1255, indicating that the hybrid protein retains the biological function of wild-type homocitrate synthase. Immunoblotting analysis revealed that the HS-GFP fusion protein is maintained intact and does not release the GFP moiety. Fluorescence microscopy analysis of the transformants showed that homocitrate synthase was mainly located in the cytoplasm in P. chrysogenum; in S. cerevisiae the enzyme is targeted to the nucleus. The control nuclear protein StuA was properly targeted to the nucleus when the StuA (targeting domain)-GFP hybrid protein was expressed in P. chrysogenum. The difference in localization of homocitrate synthase between P. chrysogenum and S. cerevisiae suggests that this protein may play a regulatory function, in addition to its catalytic function, in S. cerevisiae but not in P. chrysogenum.', 16324037: 'There are conflicting reports on the response of mitochondrial myopathy patients to the neuromuscular blocking drugs, showing either normal response or marked sensitivity.

The magnitude of such population heterogeneity has long been proposed to be linked with diverse clinical phenotypes, including antiviral therapy. Yet data accumulated thus far are fairly inconclusive. By the integration of long RT-PCR with 454 sequencing, we have built a pipeline optimized for the quantification of HCV genome-wide mutation load at 1% resolution of mutation frequency, followed by a retrospective study to examine the role of HCV mutation load in peginterferon-alpha2a and ribavirin combination antiviral therapy. Genome-wide HCV mutation load varied widely with a range from 92 to 1639 mutations and presented a Poisson distribution among 56 patients (Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic \\u200a=\\u200a0.078, p\\u200a=\\u200a0.25). Patients achieving sustained virological response (n\\u200a=\\u200a26) had significantly lower mutation loads than that in null responders (n\\u200a=\\u200a30) (mean and standard derivation: 524\\xb1279 vs. 805\\xb1271, p\\u200a=\\u200a0.00035). All 36,818 mutations detected in 56 patients displayed a power-law distribution in terms of mutation frequency in viral population. The low-frequency mutation load, but not the high-frequency load, was proportional firmly to the total mutation load. In-depth analyses revealed that intra-patient HCV population structure was shaped by multiple factors, including immune pressure, strain difference and genetic drift. These findings explain previous conflicting reports using low-resolution methods and highlight a dominant role of natural selection in response to therapeutic intervention. By attaining its signatures from complex interaction between host and virus, the high-resolution quantification of HCV mutation load predicts outcomes from interferon-based antiviral therapy and could also be a potential biomarker in other clinical settings.', 10755533: StringElement('There are conflicting reports in the literature concerning the efficacy of maintenance immunosuppression in renal transplantation with a regimen of azathioprine and steroids.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'BACKGROUND', u'Label': u'BACKGROUND'}), 3875405: 'The capacity of retinoic acid to modulate human T-lymphocyte and B-lymphocyte activation by mitogens was examined.

Numerous technical factors, such as antibody choice and cytophilic antibody artifact, impact a laboratory's ability to perform this test. There have been conflicting reports concerning the efficacy of polyclonal versus monoclonal antibodies, as well as methods of circumventing cytophilic antibodies, indicating that a consensus has not been reached on optimal methods for light chain determination. The authors have investigated methods for light chain analysis in 104 normal donors and 366 patient specimens, comparing different anti-light chain antibodies as well as strategies for analysis of specimens with low numbers of monoclonal B cells, admixed polyclonal B cells, or cytophilic antibodies. The patient specimens were either part of the initial diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected lymphoma, or were performed for staging or assessment of treatment of patients with known B-cell neoplasia. No monoclonality was detected in control specimens, and there was no significant difference in staining with monoclonal verses polyclonal anti-light chain antibodies. In addition, cytophilic antibody did not obscure results in normal controls. Monoclonality was detected in 106 patient specimens, with 89 showing gross involvement with a predominant monoclonal B-cell process. However, in 43% of the grossly monoclonal specimens, there was failure to detect monoclonality with at least one light chain antibody set, with 8% of these cases showing failure with two anti-light chain sets. This indicates the importance of antibody choice in light chain analysis. Cytophilic antibody artifact in monoclonal specimens was easily overcome by appropriate antibody combinations, obviating the need for cytophilic antibody-shedding by incubation at 37 degrees C in fetal calf serum. In 27 patient specimens with low numbers of B cells or admixed polyclonal B cells, a clonal search based on FSC and CD19 or CD20 expression was performed. In 17 of the 27 cases (63%), a small monoclonal population was detected among admixed polyclonal B cells.

DUSPs have been implicated as major modulators of critical signalling pathways that are dysregulated in various diseases. DUSPs can be divided into six subgroups on the basis of sequence similarity that include slingshots, PRLs (phosphatases of regenerating liver), Cdc14 phosphatases (Cdc is cell division cycle), PTENs (phosphatase and tensin homologues deleted on chromosome 10), myotubularins, MKPs (mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatases) and atypical DUSPs. Of these subgroups, a great deal of research has focused on the characterization of the MKPs. As their name suggests, MKPs dephosphorylate MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) proteins ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase), JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) and p38 with specificity distinct from that of individual MKP proteins. Atypical DUSPs are mostly of low-molecular-mass and lack the N-terminal CH2 (Cdc25 homology 2) domain common to MKPs. The discovery of most atypical DUSPs has occurred in the last 6 years, which has initiated a large amount of interest in their role and regulation. In the past, atypical DUSPs have generally been grouped together with the MKPs and characterized for their role in MAPK signalling cascades. Indeed, some have been shown to dephosphorylate MAPKs. The current literature hints at the potential of the atypical DUSPs as important signalling regulators, but is crowded with conflicting reports.

DNA was extracted from 25 samples of paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed gestational tissue from 21 women with at least three unexplained spontaneous abortions (mean, 3.4). DNA from an unstained paraffin section of each specimen was amplified using nested, multiplex PCR specific for the late antigen and the major immediate early genes of CMV. The assay used has a demonstrated level of sensitivity on the order of 10(-2) virocytes per square centimeter of 4-microM paraffin section. Intact DNA was successfully isolated from 21 specimens in 18 patients. Histologic features of CMV infection were completely absent from these cases, and none of these specimens contained evidence of cytomegalovirus DNA.

Opsonization of bacteria is an important early host defence mechanism required for optimal phagocytosis. There are conflicting reports in the literature as to the ability of the elderly to perform this function and one reason may be the use of in vitro tests in which the 'target' microorganism is clinically unrealistic. We have tested the hypothesis that use of a more clinically relevant microorganism Haemophilus influenzae, which commonly infects the respiratory tract of such persons, may detect abnormalities of opsonization in the elderly. Using an in vitro luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence (CL) assay we have compared sera from 45 elderly subjects (age greater than 70 years without known immune deficiency or current infection) with sera from 12 young, healthy subjects, for their capacity to opsonize Staphylococcus aureus (Oxford strain) and H. influenzae (non-capsulated) expressed as percentage CL obtained using pooled normal human serum (PNHS). There was no significant difference (median) between the elderly (95%) and the young (108%) with regard to S. aureus but opsonization of H. influenzae was poor in the elderly (63%) compared with that in the younger group (87%; P = 0.002); the sera of 11 elderly subjects having an opsonic capacity less than 30% that of PNHS. We conclude that use of the more clinically relevant microorganism, H. influenzae, appears to differentiate a subgroup of the elderly with reduced serum opsonic capacity.

Data was analyzed from the Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States (CBTRUS) from 2000 to 2013. Age-adjusted incidence rates per 100,000 person-years with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and annual percent changes (APCs) with 95% CI were calculated for OD and AOD by age, sex and race. Survival rates were calculated for age, sex and race using a subset of the CBTRUS data. OD and AOD incidence peaked at 36-40 and 56-60 years, respectively. AOD:OD ratio increased up to age 75. Overall, OD and AOD incidence decreased [OD: APC -3.2 (2000-2013), AOD: -6.5 (2000-2007)]. OD incidence was highest in Whites but decreased significantly (2000-2013: APC -3.1) while incidence in Black populations did not significantly decrease (2000-2013: APC -1.6). Survival rates decreased with advancing age for OD, while persons aged 0-24 had the lowest survival for AOD. The current study reports a decrease in overall OD and AOD incidence from 2000 to 2013. Furthermore, AOD makes up an increasing proportion of oligodendroglial tumors up to age 75. Lower AOD survival in 0-24\\xa0years old may indicate molecular differences in pediatric cases. Thus, surveillance of tumor-specific trends by age, race and sex can reveal clinically relevant variations.', 21423014: StringElement('Since the discovery of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), there have been conflicting reports as to the precise phenotypic identity, and thus an accurate description of the function of these cells in disease pathology is lacking.

To determine the genotoxic potential of C(60) nanoparticles, we prepared stable nano-sized C(60) suspensions using 0.1% carboxymethylcellulose sodium (CMC-Na) or 0.1% Tween 80 aqueous solution. We conducted a bacterial reverse mutation test with Ames Salmonella typhimurium TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537 strains and Escherichia coli strain and a chromosomal aberration test with cultured Chinese hamster CHL/IU cells in the presence and absence of metabolic activation under dark conditions and visible light irradiation using a stable C(60) nanoparticle suspension with CMC-Na. In addition, we performed a bone marrow micronucleus test using a stable C(60) nanoparticle suspension with Tween 80 on ICR mice. C(60) nanoparticles did not show a positive mutagenic response up to the maximum dose of 1000 microg/plate with any tester strain in the bacterial reverse mutation test regardless of metabolic activation and irradiation, although a slight but not significant increase in the number of revertants was observed in TA100 and WP2 uvrA/pKM101. No increase in the incidence of chromosomal aberrations was observed at any C(60) nanoparticle dose regardless of metabolic activation and irradiation in the chromosomal aberration test up to the maximum doses of 100 and 200 microg/mL. In addition, the micronucleus test showed that the in vivo clastogenic ability of the C(60) nanoparticles was negative up to the maximum dose of 88 mg/kg x 2. Therefore, we concluded that the stable and well-characterized C(60) nanoparticles did not have genotoxic ability in the bacterial reverse mutation assay, in vitro chromosome aberration assay, nor in vivo micronucleus assay.', 1201641: 'The apparent increase in the incidence of opportunist mycobacterial pulmonary infection is assessed.

There has been in the past conflicting reports on the specificity of such radiological features; it is concluded that although such appearances are not pathognomonic, their presence should arouse suspicion of such an infection and this should be confirmed or refuted by bacteriological investigations.', 2764268: 'There have been conflicting reports on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam, administered i.m. The aims of this study were to determine the pharmacokinetic data of midazolam following different doses and to test whether a correlation exists between its plasma level and sedative effect. METHODS. Fifteen patients between the ages of 18 and 50 were divided into three groups for i.m. administration of midazolam 0.05 mg/kg (group 1), 0.1 mg/kg (group 2), or 0.15 mg/kg (group 3) i.m. Venous blood was drawn 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60 min, and 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 h after the injection. After the same times the sedative effect was estimated by the anesthetist (awake, sleeping but easy to wake, sleeping and difficult to wake, unconscious). The plasma midazolam levels were determined by gas chromatography. The following pharmacokinetic parameters were ascertained: Cmax (peak concentration), tmax (time to attain peak concentration), clearance, elimination half-life. RESULTS. The peak concentration is directly proportional to the dosage of midazolam and the relation between the two is linear. The median Cmax values were 35.3 ng/ml (group 1), 103 ng/ml (group 2) and 123.5 ng/ml (group 3). The duration of tmax was between 12 and 36 min (means = 27 min). There was no significant difference between the groups in clearance, tmax, or elimination half-life. A significant correlation was found between the plasma midazolam levels and the degree of sedation. However, we observed a considerable variability in the effect. CONCLUSION. A 95% confidence interval for the prediction of the peak concentration of midazolam after i.m. injection is stated. Midazolam should be administered at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg at the most, if unconsciousness after premedication is to be avoided.', 22430975: u'Subeffective exposure of Staphylococcus aureus to the biocide triclosan can reportedly induce a small-colony variant (SCV) phenotype. S. aureus SCVs are characterized by low growth rates, reduced pigmentation, and lowered antimicrobial susceptibility. While they may exhibit enhanced intracellular survival, there are conflicting reports regarding their pathogenicity. The current study reports the characteristics of an SCV-like strain of S. aureus created by repeated passage on sublethal triclosan concentrations. S. aureus ATCC 6538 (the passage 0 [P0] strain) was serially exposed 10 times to concentration gradients of triclosan to generate strain P10. This strain was then further passaged 10 times on triclosan-free medium (designated strain \\xd710). The MICs and minimum bactericidal concentrations of triclosan for P0, P10, and \\xd710 were determined, and growth rates in biofilm and planktonic cultures were measured. Hemolysin, DNase, and coagulase activities were measured, and virulence was determined using a Galleria mellonella pathogenicity model. Strain P10 exhibited decreased susceptibility to triclosan and characteristics of an SCV phenotype, including a considerably reduced growth rate and the formation of pinpoint colonies. However, this strain also had delayed coagulase production, had impaired hemolysis (P < 0.01), was defective in biofilm formation and DNase activity, and displayed significantly attenuated virulence. Colony size, hemolysis, coagulase activity, and virulence were only partially restored in strain \\xd710, whereas the planktonic growth rate was fully restored. However, \\xd710 was at least as defective in biofilm formation and DNase production as P10. These data suggest that although repeated exposure to triclosan may result in an SCV-like phenotype, this is not necessarily associated with increased virulence and adapted bacteria may exhibit other functional deficiencies.', 17241599: StringElement('Long-term systemic retinoid therapy has been associated with skeletal side effects.

There are conflicting reports as to whether and to what extent telomerase and telomere length influence the sensitivity of cells to genotoxins. To understand the relationship between telomere length, telomerase expression, and sensitivity to genotoxic stress, we expressed the catalytic subunit of telomerase, hTERT, in human fibroblasts having different telomere lengths. We show that telomerase confers resistance to ionizing radiation, bleomycin, hydrogen peroxide, and etoposide only in cells with short, presumably near-dysfunctional, telomeres. This resistance depended on the ability of telomerase to elongate the short telomeres, and telomerase did not protect cells with long telomeres. Interestingly, although long telomeres had no effect on sensitivity to etoposide and bleomycin, they exacerbated sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide, supporting the idea that, compared to other types of DNA damage, telomeres are particularly vulnerable to oxidative damage.

Several studies have shown that treatment of Long Evans rats with PCN causes a 5- to 10-fold induction of benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylase activity, whereas little or no induction occurs in Sprague-Dawley or Wistar rats. Studies with one-month-old-male Long Evans, Sprague-Dawley, Wistar and Holtzman rats failed to reveal an anticipated strain difference in the inducibility of benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylase activity by PCN. Studies with immature and mature male and female Long Evans rats revealed that the inducibility of benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylase activity decreases with age in male but not female rats, i.e., PCN induced benzo[a]Pyrene hydroxylase activity 5- to 8-fold in immature male, immature female and mature female rats but only 2-fold in mature male rats. The age-dependent decrease in inducibility by PCN in male rats coincided with an age-dependent increase (2.4-fold) in the basal activity of benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylase. These sex-dependent developmental changes can be explained by an age-dependent increase in the constitutive levels of the major PCN-inducible form of cytochrome P-450 (cytochrome P-450-PCN) in male but not female rats. Electrophoresis of liver microsomes and studies on the binding of metyrapone to dithionite-reduced cytochrome P-450 provided additional evidence for age- and sex-dependent differences in the levels of microsomal cytochrome P-450-PCN. In addition to reconciling the conflicting literature reports, the age- and sex-dependent differences in cytochrome P-450-PCN levels account, at least in part, for age and sex differences in certain liver microsomal enzyme activities, including benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylase activity.', 7749141: 'The immunohistochemical expression of the aspartyl protease enzyme cathepsin D was examined in a consecutive series of 103 primary operable breast carcinomas with the polyclonal antibody NCL-CDp. Expression of cathepsin D was identified within the epithelial and stromal components of all tumours examined. No significant associations of increased cathepsin D expression in the epithelial tumour component with conventional prognostic indices such as tumour size, grade, lymph node stage, or patient survival were identified.

This response is initiated through the interaction of Mtb cell wall surface components, mostly glycolipids, with cells of the innate immune system, particularly macrophages (M\\u03c6s) and dendritic cells (DCs). The way M\\u03c6s and DC alter their cytokine secretome, activate or inhibit different microbicidal mechanisms and present antigens and consequently trigger the T cell-mediated immune response impacts the host immune response against Mtb. Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) is one of the major cell wall components of Mtb. Mannosyl-capped LAM (ManLAM), and its related cell wall-associated types of glycolipids/lipoglycans, namely phosphatidylinositol mannosides (PIMs) and lipomannan (LM), exhibit important and distinct immunomodulatory properties. The structure, internal heterogeneity and abundance of these molecules vary between Mtb strains exhibiting distinct degrees of virulence. Thus ManLAM, LM and PIMs may be considered crucial Mtb-associated virulence factors in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis. Of particular relevance for this review, there is controversy about the specific immunomodulatory properties of these distinct glycolipids, particularly when tested as purified molecules in vitro. In addition to the variability in the glycolipid composition conflicting reports may also result from differences in the protocols used for glycolipid isolation and for in vitro experiments including immune cell types and procedures to generate them. Understanding the immunomodulatory properties of these cell wall glycolipids, how they differ between distinct Mtb strains, and how they influence the degree of Mtb virulence, is of utmost relevance to understand how the host mounts a protective or otherwise pathologic immune response. This is essential for the design of preventive strategies against tuberculosis. Thus, since clarifying the controversy on this matter is crucial we here review, summarize and discuss reported data from in vitro stimulation with the three major Mtb complex cell wall glycolipids (ManLAM, PIMs and LM) in an attempt to conciliate the conflicting findings.\", 25249303: StringElement('Although age is no contraindication for pancreatic cancer resections, there are conflicting reports of morbidity and mortality rates and only few data showing direct comparisons of survival for octogenarians and patients younger than 80 years.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'BACKGROUND', u'Label': u'BACKGROUND'}), 17618457: 'There are conflicting reports regarding the association of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection with growth failure. We evaluated the role of H. pylori infection on malnutrition and growth failure in dyspeptic children.

The study cases were grouped as H. pylori [+] (n = 57) and H. pylori [-] (n = 51) by the presence or absence of microorganism in gastric tissue, respectively. Age, gender, height for age (H/A), weight for height (W/H), body mass index (BMI), weight and height z scores and the daily calorie intake of the children were recorded. Malnutrition and growth failure were evaluated by the Waterlow criteria and height z score, respectively. Then, the H. pylori [+], H. pylori [-] and control groups were compared in relation to the variables defined above. All groups were similar with respect to gender and age. The daily calorie intake was lower in dyspeptic children. Although anthropometric variables were similar in the H. pylori [+] and [-] groups, the control cases had higher W/H compared to both H. pylori [+] (p = 0.030) and H. pylori [-] (p = 0.000) cases, and higher BMI (p = 0.001) and weight z scores (p = 0.014) than those in the H. pylori [-] group.

The capacity to minimise the effects of repeated events rests predominantly with the reliability of allergy documentation in medical records and computerised physician order entry systems (CPOES) with decision support such as allergy alerts.

It is not concerned with pharmacovigilance systems that monitor ADRs on a global scale. There are conflicting reports regarding the efficacy of these strategies. Although in many cases allergy alerts are effective, lack of sensitivity and contextual relevance can often induce doctors to override alerts. Human factors such as user fatigue and inadequate adverse drug event reporting, including ADRs, are commonplace. The quality of and response to allergy documentation can be enhanced by the participation of nurses and pharmacists, particularly in medication reconciliation.

To define the participation of TNF in EAE development, we back-crossed TNF-deficient mice (H-2b) into the SJL/J strain and directly compared them to H-2b congenic SJL or inbred SJL/J mice. Induction of EAE with myelin basic protein (MBP) revealed that H-2b congenic SJL mice are fully susceptible, indicating that the H-2b haplotype does not affect disease susceptibility. Using H-2b congenic SJL mice we show here that TNF deficiency modifies the normal course of EAE by considerably delaying the onset for approximately 5 days, suggesting that TNF is required for the normal initiation of MBP-induced EAE. However, TNF-deficient mice eventually developed severe EAE with perivascular inflammation and primary demyelination similar to wild-type controls, indicating that TNF is not essential during these processes. Taken together, these results indicate that although TNF is not required for the progression of MBP-induced EAE, it contributes positively by advancing the onset of disease.', 11103802: 'Mitomycin C (MMC) is a clinically used anticancer drug that is reduced to cytotoxic metabolites by cellular reductases via a process known as bioreductive drug activation. The identification of key enzymes responsible for drug activation has been investigated extensively with the ultimate aim of tailoring drug administration to patients whose tumors possess the biochemical machinery required for drug activation. In the case of MMC, considerable interest has been centered upon the enzyme DT-diaphorase (DTD) although conflicting reports of good and poor correlations between enzyme activity and response in vitro and in vivo have been published. The principle aim of this study was to provide a definitive answer to the question of whether tumor response to MMC could be predicted on the basis of DTD activity in a large panel of human tumor xenografts. DTD levels were measured in 45 human tumor xenografts that had been characterized previously in terms of their sensitivity to MMC in vitro and in vivo (the in vivo response profile to MMC was taken from work published previously). A poor correlation between DTD activity and antitumor activity in vitro as well as in vivo was obtained. This study also assessed the predictive value of an alternative approach based upon the ability of tumor homogenates to metabolize MMC. This approach is based on the premise that the overall rate of MMC metabolism may provide a better indicator of response than single enzyme measurements. MMC metabolism was evaluated in tumor homogenates (clarified by centrifugation at 1000 x g for 1 min) by measuring the disappearance of the parent compound by HPLC. In responsive [T/C <10% (T/C defined as the relative size of treated and control tumors)] and resistant (T/C >50%) tumors, the mean half life of MMC was 75+/-48.3 and 280+/-129.6 min, respectively. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P < 0.005). In conclusion, these results unequivocally demonstrate that response to MMC in vivo cannot be predicted on the basis of DTD activity. Measurement of MMC metabolism by tumor homogenates on the other hand may provide a better indicator of tumor response, and further studies are required to determine whether this approach has real clinical potential in terms of individualizing patient chemotherapy.', 25407036: StringElement('Temporal artery (TA) thermometry has come as one of the new methods for temperature measurement, especially in children in whom accurate temperature monitoring can save lives.

When sodium caseinate- (NaCas) and WP-stabilized emulsions with an oil-to-protein ratio ranging from 0.25 to 5 are dehydrated, NaCas is a more effective encapsulant than WP because of its superior emulsifying properties and resistance to heat denaturation. Denaturation degree of WP during drying has been associated with increased powder surface fat and larger droplet size after reconstitution. Encapsulation of NaCas-stabilized emulsions improves in the presence of lactose; powder surface fat was reduced from 30 to <5% when lactose was added at a 1:1 ratio to NaCas in an emulsion containing 30% (wt/wt) oil. This has been related to the ability of lactose to form solid-like (or glassy) capsules during sudden dehydration. Encapsulation of WP-stabilized emulsions is not improved by addition of lactose, although there are conflicting reports in the literature. Storage stability of dehydrated dairy-like emulsions is strongly linked to lactose crystallization as release of encapsulated material occurs during storage at high relative humidities (e.g., 75%). The use of alternative carbohydrates as \"matrix-forming\" materials (such as maltodextrins or gum arabic) improves storage stability but compromises the emulsion droplet size after reconstitution. The composition of the powder surface has been recognized as a key parameter in dehydrated emulsion quality. It is the chemical composition of the powder surface that dictates the behavior of the bulk in terms of wettability, flowability, and stability. Analyses, using electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis of the surface of industrial milk powders and dehydrated emulsions that mimicked the composition of milk, showed that powder surface is covered mainly by fat, even when the fat content is very low (18 and 99% surface fat coverage for skim milk and whole milk powders, respectively). The functional properties of milk constituents during emulsion dehydration are far from being thoroughly understood; future research needs include a) the encapsulation properties of pure micellar casein; b) a deeper understanding of colloidal phenomena (such as changes in the oil-water and air-oil interfaces) that occur before, during, and after dehydration, which ultimately define emulsion stability after drying; and c) reconciliation of the current different views on powder surface composition.', 27997763: '+ICC being involved in sensory and/or motor aspects of bladder physiology should be revised.', 12381764: 'There are conflicting reports for the role of endogenous opioids on sympathetic and cardiovascular responses to exercise in humans.

Placebo had no effect on resting, IHG, and PEMI responses. We conclude that morphine modulates cardiovascular and sympathetic responses at rest but not during isometric exercise.', 24452681: 'Borrelia burgdorferi encodes a homologue of the bacterial carbon storage regulator A (CsrA). Recently, it was reported that CsrA contributes to B. burgdorferi infectivity and is required for the activation of the central RpoN-RpoS regulatory pathway. However, many questions concerning the function of CsrA in B. burgdorferi gene regulation remain unanswered. In particular, there are conflicting reports concerning the molecular details of how CsrA may modulate rpoS expression and, thus, how CsrA may influence the RpoN-RpoS pathway in B. burgdorferi. To address these key discrepancies, we examined the role of CsrA in differential gene expression in the Lyme disease spirochete. Upon engineering an inducible csrA expression system in B. burgdorferi, controlled hyperexpression of CsrA in a merodiploid strain did not significantly alter the protein and transcript levels of bosR, rpoS, and RpoS-dependent genes (such as ospC and dbpA). In addition, we constructed isogenic csrA mutants in two widely used infectious B. burgdorferi strains. When expression of bosR, rpoS, ospC, and dbpA was compared between the csrA mutants and their wild-type counterparts, no detectable differences were observed. Finally, animal studies indicated that the csrA mutants remained infectious for and virulent in mice. Analyses of B. burgdorferi gene expression in mouse tissues showed comparable levels of rpoS transcripts by the csrA mutants and the parental strains. Taken together, these results constitute compelling evidence that CsrA is not involved in activation of the RpoN-RpoS pathway and is dispensable for mammalian infectious processes carried out by B. burgdorferi.', 28030541: 'The ortholog conjecture implies that functional similarity between orthologous genes is higher than between paralogs. It has been supported using levels of expression and Gene Ontology term analysis, although the evidence was rather weak and there were also conflicting reports. In this study on 12 species we provide strong evidence of high conservation in tissue-specificity between orthologs, in contrast to low conservation between within-species paralogs. This allows us to shed a new light on the evolution of gene expression patterns. While there have been several studies of the correlation of expression between species, little is known about the evolution of tissue-specificity itself. Ortholog tissue-specificity is strongly conserved between all tetrapod species, with the lowest Pearson correlation between mouse and frog at r = 0.66. Tissue-specificity correlation decreases strongly with divergence time. Paralogs in human show much lower conservation, even for recent Primate-specific paralogs. When both paralogs from ancient whole genome duplication tissue-specific paralogs are tissue-specific, it is often to different tissues, while other tissue-specific paralogs are mostly specific to the same tissue. The same patterns are observed using human or mouse as focal species, and are robust to choices of datasets and of thresholds. Our results support the following model of evolution: in the absence of duplication, tissue-specificity evolves slowly, and tissue-specific genes do not change their main tissue of expression; after small-scale duplication the less expressed paralog loses the ancestral specificity, leading to an immediate difference between paralogs; over time, both paralogs become more broadly expressed, but remain poorly correlated. Finally, there is a small number of paralog pairs which stay tissue-specific with the same main tissue of expression, for at least 300 million years.', 10503759: StringElement('Authors have unanimously reported that 10 mg of loratadine does not produce sedation.

This report shows that the leucocytes from four SSPE patients exhibited strong sensitivity to both measles and SSPE virus preparations as measured by the macrophage migration inhibition test, mixed lymphocyte virus infected cell culture test, and the lymphotoxin assay. Earlier suggestions that a factor may be operating to suppress cellular reactivity are confirmed by the demonstration that the response of lymphocytes from SSPE patients could be blocked by the addition of SSPE spinal fluid or plasma. It was determined that the blocking factor was stable at -20 degrees C, heat labile at 56 degrees C for 30 minutes, trypsin and neuraminadase sensitive, and had a mol wt greater than 150,000 as determined by Sephadex G-200 gel chromatography.

However, much less is known about the role of ER\\u03b2 and its relevance remains unclear due to the publication of conflicting reports. Here, we provide evidence that much of this controversy may be explained by variability in antibody sensitivity and specificity and describe the development, characterization, and potential applications of a novel monoclonal antibody targeting full-length human ER\\u03b2 and its splice variant forms. Specifically, we demonstrate that a number of commercially available ER\\u03b2 antibodies are insensitive for ER\\u03b2 and exhibit significant cross-reaction with ER\\u03b1. However, our newly developed MC10 ER\\u03b2 antibody is shown to be highly specific and sensitive for detection of full-length ER\\u03b2 and its variant forms. Strong and variable staining patterns for endogenous levels of ER\\u03b2 protein were detected in normal human tissues and breast tumors using the MC10 antibody. Importantly, ER\\u03b2 was shown to be expressed in a limited cohort of both ER\\u03b1 positive and ER\\u03b1 negative breast tumors. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the use of poorly validated ER\\u03b2 antibodies is likely to explain much of the controversy in the field with regard to the biological relevance of ER\\u03b2 in breast cancer. The use of the MC10 antibody, in combination with highly specific antibodies targeting only full-length ER\\u03b2, is likely to provide additional discriminatory features in breast cancers that may be useful in predicting response to therapy.', 22355547: 'The current protocols for blocking background staining in immunohistochemistry are based on conflicting reports. Background staining is thought to occur as a result of either non-specific antibody (Ab) binding to endogenous Fc receptors (FcRs) or a combination of ionic and hydrophobic interactions. In this study, cell and tissue samples were processed according to routine protocols either with or without a blocking step (goat serum or BSA). Surprisingly, no Abs in samples processed without a blocking step showed any propensity for non-specific binding leading to background staining, implying that endogenous FcRs do not retain their ability to bind the Fc portion of Abs after standard fixation. Likewise, we did not find any non-specific Ab binding ascribable to either ionic or hydrophobic interactions. We determined that traditionally used protein blocking steps are unnecessary in the immunostaining of routinely fixed cell and tissue samples.', 20539322: 'Adenovirus is the most frequently used virus in gene therapy clinical trials. There have been conflicting reports on the ability of adenovirus to transduce primary ovarian cancer samples and the expression of relevant cell surface molecules. These factors were examined using primary ovarian cancer cells cultured from ascites and solid tumor to gain insights into the clinical use of adenovirus in ovarian cancer. The level of transduction of primary cultures was much higher than uncultured cells and established cell lines, and correlated with higher levels of coxsackie-adenovirus receptor (CAR) and integrin expression. Growth of primary cultures in autologous ascitic fluid prevented an increase in CAR expression and inhibited transduction compared with cells treated in supplemented RPMI. Cells at the periphery of solid tumor samples were transduced using a replication-incompetent virus and correlated with CAR expression. However, transduction was abolished by autologous ascitic fluid, despite the expression of CAR. We conclude that the use of adenoviruses for ovarian cancer gene therapy will require testing in the presence of inhibitory factors in ascitic fluid. The clinical use of adenoviral vectors may require circumvention of such inhibitory factors and the use of replication competent adenovirus to enable efficient viral penetration of the cancer.', 10712671: 'The present study investigated whether an explanation for the conflicting reports on the interleukin-2 (IL-2) status of amniotic fluid is due to the presence of IL-15 which shares biological activities with IL-2 and utilizes the IL-2 receptor beta-chain. Amniotic fluids from 45 normally progressing pregnancies between 14 and 16 weeks after the last menstrual period were assayed for IL-2 and IL-15 by bioassay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The ability of amniotic fluids to induce cytotoxic T lymphoblastoid line-2 (CTLL-2) cell proliferation was demonstrated to be dependent upon bioassay culture conditions. In serum-free medium each amniotic fluid stimulated CTLL-2 proliferation with a mean level of IL-2-like bioactivity of 14.7 +/- 2.3 ng/ml but amniotic fluids failed to induce CTLL-2 proliferation in serum-supplemented medium. Treatment with neutralizing anti-IL-2 or anti-IL-15 antibodies failed to inhibit amniotic fluid-induced CTLL cell proliferation in serum-free medium, indicating a lack of IL-2 and IL-15 bioactivity. In contrast, treatment with anti-IL-2 receptor beta-chain antibody significantly reduced amniotic fluid-induced proliferation. The lack of IL-2 and IL-15 activity in amniotic fluids was confirmed using ELISA. Although high levels of IL-15 immunoactivity were detected in all samples, specificity controls showed a lack of specific IL-15 immunoactivity in amniotic fluid. Pretreatment of amniotic fluids with 100-500 ng/ml mouse immunoglobulin G abrogated IL-15 immunoactivity, indicating that amniotic fluid contains molecules binding to Fc regions of immunoglobulins and responsible for false ELISA positivity. These studies unequivocally show that amniotic fluid lacks IL-2 and IL-15 but can stimulate CTLL-2 cell proliferation via the IL-2 receptor beta-chain. The absence of IL-2 and IL-15 in normal mid-trimester amniotic fluid suggests that the cytokine profile of human pregnancy appears to be associated with a bias against type 1 cytokines within the feto-placental unit.', 3786336: \"The influence of pretreatment with 5.0 or 10.0 mg/kg of indomethacin, a prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor, on the alterations in body temperature produced by 3.0 and 4.0 g/kg of ethanol, was studied in food-deprived and free-feeding rats. A partial antagonism of ethanol's hypothermic effect resulted from indomethacin pretreatments and this effect was found to be ethanol dose-dependent. This result could account for the conflicting reports in the literature on the effectiveness of indomethacin in antagonizing ethanol-induced hypothermia. Indomethacin (5.0 mg/kg) also antagonized ethanol-induced hypoglycemia in 48 hr starved rats. The relationship between two effects of ethanol, hypothermia and hypoglycemia, is discussed.\", 1063185: \"The fact that electrosurgical cutting is governed by factors that have no influence on steel scalpel cutting is responsible for discrepancies among the results of investigations of the modalities.

There are conflicting reports about its effect on female fertility. This study investigated ovarian reserve and IVF-preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) outcome in women with DM1. A total of 21 women undergoing PGD for DM1 were compared with 21 age- and body mass index-matched women undergoing PGD for other diseases. Ovarian reserve markers, response to stimulation, embryo quality and clinical pregnancy and live birth rates were compared. Day-3 FSH concentration was higher, while anti-M\\xfcllerian hormone concentration and antral follicle count were lower in the DM1 group (median, range: 6.9 (1.8-11.3) versus 5.7 (1.5-10.7)IU/l; 0.9 (0.17-5.96) versus 2.68 (0.5-9.1)ng/ml; and 13 (0-63) versus 23 (8-40) follicles, respectively, all P < 0.05). Total FSH dose was higher (5200 versus 2250 IU, P = 0.004), while the numbers of oocytes retrieved (10 versus 16, P < 0.04) and metaphase-II oocytes (9 versus 12, P < 0.03) were lower in the DM1 group. The number of cycles with top-quality embryos and the clinical pregnancy rate were lower in the DM1 group. In conclusion, there is evidence of diminished ovarian reserve and less favourable IVF-PGD outcome in women with DM1. Myotonic Dystrophy (DM) is the most common form of muscular dystrophy in adults. There is evidence of subfertility in males affected with the disease but conflicting reports about the effect of the disease on female fertility. The aim of our study was to investigate ovarian reserve and IVF-PGD results in women with DM. Twenty-one women undergoing preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) treatment for DM were compared to 21 age- and BMI matched women undergoing PGD treatment for other diseases. The two groups were compared for antral follicle count (AFC) and serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels (the best known markers of ovarian reserve and fertility potential), ovarian response, embryo quality and pregnancy and live birth rates. AFC and the AMH levels were statistically significant lower in the DM group. Total medication dose needed for ovarian stimulation was higher, the number of oocytes and mature oocytes retrieved, and the number of cycles with top quality embryos were lower in the DM group compared to the controls. In conclusion, there is evidence of diminished ovarian reserve, and less favorable IVF-PGD outcome in women with DM. Therefore, we recommend advising these women about the possibility of early decreasing ovarian function in order to prevent any delay in reproductive planning.', 16879217: 'The large number of conflicting reports on the presence and concentration of circulating tissue factor (TF) in blood generates uncertainties regarding its relevance to hemostasis and association with specific diseases. We believe that the source of these controversies lies in part in the assays used for TF quantitation. We have developed a highly sensitive and specific double monoclonal antibody fluorescence-based immunoassay and integrated it into the Luminex Multi-Analyte Platform. This assay, which uses physiologically relevant standard and appropriate specificity controls, measures TF antigen in recombinant products and natural sources including placenta, plasma, cell lysates and cell membranes. Comparisons of reactivity patterns of various full-length and truncated TFs on an equimolar basis revealed quantitative differences in the immune recognition of TFs by our antibodies in the order of TF 1-263 > 1-242 > 1-218 > placental TF. Despite this differential recognition, all TF species are quantifiable at concentrations < or = 2 pM. Using a calibration curve constructed with recombinant TF 1-263 and plasma from healthy individuals (n = 91), we observed the concentration of TF antigen in plasma to be substantially lower than that generally reported in the literature: TF antigen in plasma of 72 individuals (79%) was below 2 pM (quantitative limit of our assay); TF antigen levels between 2.0 and 5.0 pM could be detected in six individuals (7%); and in 14% (13 plasmas), the non-specific signal was higher than the specific signal, and thus TF levels could not be determined. These differential recognition patterns affect TF quantitation in plasma and should be considered when evaluating plasma TF-like antigen concentrations.', 21577331: u'Increased risk of osteoporosis, fractures, and avascular necrosis (AVN) has been suggested in multiple sclerosis (MS). Patients with MS are often exposed to corticosteroid treatment (CST) during the disease course and conflicting reports exist regarding complications of CST. Our study aims to investigate the association between cumulative doses of CST and radiographic evaluation of AVN of the femoral head in MS. Twenty-six MS patients (mean age, 38.4\\xb110 yr) were enrolled and prospectively evaluated for AVN by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The mean disease duration was 11.5\\xb18.5 years and mean expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score was 3\\xb12. The cumulative dosage of CST varied between 20 g and 60 g; patients were grouped into two categories: 1) CST between 20-40 g, 17 (65%) patients; 2) CST \\u226540 g; 9 (35%) patients. The relationship between cumulative CST dosage and MRI diagnosis of AVN was statistically insignificant (P>0.9). Clarification of the cumulative effect of CST in the development of AVN is of great importance for future long-term steroid treatment strategies.', 24487540: 'The harvesting of rainwater is gaining acceptance among many governmental authorities in countries such as Australia, Germany, and South Africa, among others. However, conflicting reports on the microbial quality of harvested rainwater have been published. To monitor the presence of potential pathogenic bacteria during high-rainfall periods, rainwater from 29 rainwater tanks was sampled on four occasions (during June and August 2012) in a sustainable housing project in Kleinmond, South Africa. This resulted in the collection of 116 harvested rainwater samples in total throughout the sampling period. The identities of the dominant, indigenous, presumptive pathogenic isolates obtained from the rainwater samples throughout the sampling period were confirmed through universal 16S rRNA PCR, and the results revealed that Pseudomonas (19% of samples) was the dominant genus isolated, followed by Aeromonas (16%), Klebsiella (11%), and Enterobacter (9%). PCR assays employing genus-specific primers also confirmed the presence of Aeromonas spp. (16%), Klebsiella spp. (47%), Legionella spp. (73%), Pseudomonas spp. (13%), Salmonella spp. (6%), Shigella spp. (27%), and Yersinia spp. (28%) in the harvested rainwater samples. In addition, on one sampling occasion, Giardia spp. were detected in 25% of the eight tank water samples analyzed. This study highlights the diverse array of pathogenic bacteria that persist in harvested rainwater during high-rainfall periods. The consumption of untreated harvested rainwater could thus pose a potential significant health threat to consumers, especially children and immunocompromised individuals, and it is recommended that harvested rainwater be treated for safe usage as an alternative water source.', 6089971: 'There are conflicting reports of a possible contribution of noradrenergic projections to the rostral hypothalamus to drinking and blood pressure regulation. The present study investigated the effects of injecting phentolamine into the anterior hypothalamus-preoptic region on drinking and blood pressure responses elicited by injecting angiotensin II into a lateral cerebral ventricle of the rat. Angiotensin II (250 ng or 25 ng) elicited water intakes averaging 9.25 +/- 0.52 ml and 4.35 +/- 0.44 ml respectively in 15 min with latencies of less than 3 min. Phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, injected into the rostral hypothalamus produced a dose-dependent reduction in water intake and number of laps taken accompanied by an increased latency to drink. In the urethane anaesthetized rat, angiotensin II produced significant increases in blood pressure. Injections of phentolamine into rostral hypothalamic sites in which drinking responses to angiotensin II were attenuated, also attenuated the pressor response to angiotensin II. These results indicate that alpha-adrenergic input to the rostral hypothalamus is involved in both the pressor and drinking responses elicited by central angiotensin II.', 16461431: 'Neutrophil recruitment into lung constitutes a major response to airborne endotoxins. In many tissues endothelial intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) interacts with lymphocyte function associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) on neutrophils, and this interaction plays a critical role in neutrophil recruitment. There are conflicting reports about the role of ICAM-1 in neutrophil recruitment into lungs. We studied neutrophil recruitment into alveolar space in a murine model of aerosolized LPS-induced lung inflammation. LPS induces at least a 100-fold increase in neutrophil numbers in alveolar space, as determined by flow cytometry of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Neutrophil recruitment was reduced by 54% in ICAM-1 null mice and by 45% in LFA-1 null mice. In wild-type mice treated with anti-ICAM-1 and anti-LFA-1 antibodies, there was 51 and 58% reduction in the neutrophil recruitment, respectively. In chimeric mice, generated by the transplantation of mixtures of bone marrows from LFA-1 null and wild-type mice, the normalized recruitment of LFA-1 null neutrophils was reduced by 60% compared with wild-type neutrophils. Neither the treatment of ICAM-1 null mice with a function-blocking antibody to LFA-1 nor the treatment of LFA-1 null mice with anti-ICAM-1 antibody resulted in further reduction in the recruitment compared with untreated ICAM-1 null and LFA-1 null mice. We conclude that ICAM-1 and LFA-1 play critical roles in the recruitment of neutrophils into the alveolar space in aerosolized LPS-induced lung inflammation, and LFA-1 serves as a ligand of ICAM-1 in the lung.', 19810581: 'Obesity is known to alter various physiological parameters including the pain sensitivity. There are conflicting reports on the pain sensitivity in obesity. In this context, the present study was aimed to investigate the tonic pain response in obese rabbit model. To achieve this aim, two groups of adult male British Angora rabbits were used. One of the groups was fed with standard rabbit chow and served as control. The other group was fed high fat diet (HFD) for 10 weeks to produce obesity. The standard formalin test was performed at the start and after 10 weeks of dietary regimen in both the groups. Timed behavioral responses (limping, elevation of paw, licking, biting, grooming etc.) were categorized and quantified with the help of standard pain rating scale. The total average pain rating score decreased significantly from 2.01 +/- 0.02 to 1.47 +/- 0.08 (P < 0.05) in HFD group after 10 weeks of dietary regimen, whereas there was no change in the control group. A significant negative correlation was observed between body weight and pain rating score in HFD group of rabbits (P < 0.05, r = -0.62). Results suggest that obesity attenuates the tonic pain responses induced by formalin in British Angora rabbits.', 12115584: 'There have been conflicting reports of the apoptotic effects of nicotine on human cells and those studies reporting nicotine-induced apoptosis have not unequivocally clarified the molecular mechanisms underlying the effect. However, we found here that human RSa cells, established from embryonic fibroblastic cells doubly infected with Rous sarcoma virus and Simian virus 40, underwent apoptosis when cultured with medium containing 0.06-0.6 microM nicotine. The apoptosis was assessed by cellular DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 protease activation. Viability of RSa cells was reduced by nicotine treatment, as analyzed by MTT assay and the reduction was lessened by combination treatment with a caspase-3 inhibitor, acetyl-L-aspartyl-L-glutamyl-L-valyl-L-aspart-1-al (Ac-DEVD-CHO). Levels of expression of heat shock protein 90 alpha (Hsp90 alpha) were found to be increased 20 min after the nicotine treatment, as analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-based mRNA differential display after Northern blotting analysis of mRNA amounts. Cellular contents of Hsp90 alpha were furthermore increased in the nicotine-treated RSa cells, as quantitated by Western immunoblot analysis. By contrast, in RSa cells treated with nicotine in combination with geldanamycin (GA), an inhibitor of Hsp90 alpha function, DNA fragmentation was not detected and caspase-3 protease activity levels were the same as those of mock-treated cells. Nicotine-induced caspase-3 activation and Hsp90 alpha expression, as well as suppression of the induction by GA, were also observed in a xeroderma pigmentosum patient-derived cell line, XP2OS cells. Thus, it was suggested that nicotine induces apoptosis, possibly via Hsp90 alpha expression, in human cells tested.', 21511811: 'Despite advances in our understanding of the pathology of heart failure modern conventional pharmacological therapies have proved insufficient.

This reflects the complexity of gonadal steroid hormone actions in the body resulting from multiple sites of action that impact fluid and electrolyte balance (e.g. VP target organs, afferent pathways regulating the VP neurons, and the VP secreting neurons themselves). It also reflects involvement of multiple types of estrogen receptors (ER) in these diverse sites including ERs that act as transcription factors regulating gene expression (i.e. the classic ERalpha as well as the more recently discovered ERbeta) and potentially G-protein coupled, membrane localized ERs that mediate rapid non-genomic actions of estrogen. Furthermore, altered expression of these receptors in physiologically diverse conditions of fluid and electrolyte balance contributes to the difficulty of using simplistic approaches such as gender comparisons, gonadectomy, and hormone replacement to assess the role of gonadal steroids in regulation of VP secretion for maintenance of fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. This review catalogs these inconsistencies and provides a frame work for understanding them by describing: (1) the effect of gonadal steroids on target organ responsiveness to VP; (2) the expression of multiple types of estrogen receptors in the VP neurons and in brain regions monitoring feedback signals from the periphery; and (3) the impact of dehydration and hyponatremia on expression of these receptors.', 14575241: 'The neuronal protein alpha-synuclein has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. Although many studies report that alpha-synuclein expression is restricted to neuronal presynaptic terminals, this protein aggregates in Lewy bodies in somata that are typically distant from their axon terminals. Few studies have addressed this paradox and there has been no compelling explanation proposed for the apparent discrepancy between the locus of neuronal alpha-synuclein expression and the loci of Lewy bodies in the majority of Parkinson disease cases. We explored this issue by extensively characterizing the monoclonal antibody Synuclein-1 (Syn-1) and using this highly selective antibody to map the distribution of alpha-synuclein throughout rat brain and in human substantia nigra (SN). Additionally, alpha-synuclein expression in rat SN detected by 2 polyclonal antibodies against alpha-synuclein was compared with that detected by the Syn-1 antibody. In contrast with many previous reports, alpha-synuclein was detected by Syn-1 in neuronal somata and dendrites in restricted brain regions, as well as more ubiquitously in axons and terminals. The strongest alpha-synuclein neuronal expression in rat was found in brainstem and cortical regions that are homologous to regions prone to Lewy body formation in humans. The Syn-1 antibody labeled abundant somatodendritic alpha-synuclein in both rat and human SN, a major locus of Lewy body formation and neurodegeneration in Parkinson disease. By contrast, very few immunoreactive somata in the rat SN were labeled by the 2 polyclonal antibodies. We explore possible explanations for the differences in conflicting reports of patterns of alpha-synuclein expression in brain, including differences among antibodies.', 3171980: 'Prompted by conflicting reports of both agonist and antagonist properties of the S-(+)-enantiomer of the potent dopamine agonist R-(-)-N-n-propylnorapomorphine (NPA), we carried out extracellular, single unit recording studies to compare the effects of both enantiomers on substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons in male rats anesthetized with chloral hydrate. Like the classic dopamine agonist apomorphine, R-(-)-NPA inhibited cell firing in both populations. Mean cumulative doses to inhibit firing by 50% (ID50) were 0.53 micrograms/kg for nigral and 0.50 micrograms/kg for VTA dopamine cells, respectively, reflecting a potency for R-(-)-NPA 10-fold greater than that of apomorphine for inhibition of nigral dopamine cells (ID50 5.3 micrograms/kg). Inhibitions elicited by R-(-)-NPA could be fully reversed by i.v. haloperidol (0.2 mg/kg) but not by S-(+)-NPA in doses up to 0.9 mg/kg. Interestingly, S-(+)-NPA also exhibited agonist activity in both cell groups but with a much lower potency than R-(-)-NPA. In addition, VTA dopamine cells displayed a significantly greater sensitivity to the drug: ID50 values of 149 micrograms/kg vs. 514 micrograms/kg for VTA and substantia nigra neurons, respectively (P less than .01). Prior administration of haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg) consistently and fully prevented the inhibitory effects of S-(+)-NPA on all cells tested, although subsequent administration of haloperidol (up to 1.6 mg/kg) did not reverse completely S-(+)-NPA-induced inhibitions in all cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)', 24643214: StringElement('To learn the frequency of conflicting race/ethnicity reports, to examine patterns of conflicting reports, and to identify possible avenues for data quality improvement.', attributes={u'NlmCategory': u'OBJECTIVE', u'Label': u'OBJECTIVE'}), 3487376: \"The effect of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) on nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons in the mouse was re-examined in view of recent conflicting reports regarding the neurotoxic effect of MPTP in this experimental animal. It was found that while MPTP destroyed a substantial number of dopaminergic nerve terminals in the striatum of young mature (6-8 weeks old) mice, it left the majority of cells in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra (SNc) unaffected. It was also found that 5 months after MPTP treatment there was substantial, although incomplete, recovery of striatal DA nerve terminal markers (DA level, metabolites, uptake, [3H]mazindol binding). Given these observations, it is concluded that while the young mature MPTP mouse may not be a valid animal model of Parkinson's disease (since it does not develop severe SNc cell loss characteristic of this disorder), it will be valuable for the study of how MPTP destroys dopaminergic nerve terminals and may prove useful as an experimental system for studying recovery of dopaminergic fibers after injury and for exploring ways to accelerate this recovery.\", 1920657: 'Pasteurella multocida, the cause of avian cholera, has naturally infected over 100 species of free-living birds. Among wild birds, avian cholera has its greatest impact on North American wildfowl. Epizootics usually are explosive in onset and may involve thousands of birds. The disease has been reported in every month of the year among wildfowl. Disproportionate mortality, with some species suffering proportionately greater mortality than others, has been a common feature of this disease. Presence of animal organic matter plays a significant role in the survival of P. multocida. There are conflicting reports or a lack of information on the role of host sex, age, body size, other physical features, genetic variation or behavioral differences, as predisposing factors to infection by P. multocida. There also are ambiguities on the relationship between season, precipitation, temperature, nutritional stress, water quality, other microorganisms, and environmental contaminants, and the occurrence of avian cholera in wildfowl. Two competing hypotheses for the year-round reservoir of wildfowl strains of P. multocida are ambient soil or water of enzootic sites, and carrier animals; most current evidence favors the role of carrier animals. Transmission most likely occurs by ingestion of contaminated water, inhalation of bacteria-rich aerosols, or both. While many techniques have been proposed to prevent or control avian cholera, none have been rigorously tested to determine their effectiveness.', 9105043: 'In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the growing bud inherits a portion of the mitochondrial network from the mother cell soon after it emerges.

The MDM20 gene encodes a 93-kD polypeptide with no homology to other characterized proteins. Extra copies of TPM1, a gene encoding the actin filament-binding protein tropomyosin, suppress mitochondrial inheritance defects and partially restore actin cables in mdm20 delta cells. Synthetic lethality is also observed between mdm20 and tpm1 mutant strains. Overexpression of a second yeast tropomyosin, Tpm2p, rescues mutant phenotypes in the mdm20 strain to a lesser extent. Together, these results provide compelling evidence that mitochondrial inheritance in yeast is an actin-mediated process. MDM20 and TPM1 also exhibit the same pattern of genetic interactions; mutations in MDM20 are synthetically lethal with mutations in BEM2 and MYO2 but not SAC6. Although MDM20 and TPM1 are both required for the formation and/or stabilization of actin cables, mutations in these genes disrupt mitochondrial inheritance and nuclear segregation to different extents. Thus, Mdm20p and Tpm1p may act in vivo to establish molecular and functional heterogeneity of the actin cytoskeleton.', 3047064: 'Since there are conflicting reports in the literature on a possible relationship between the K1 capsular polysaccharide (CP) content of Escherichia coli and its susceptibility to killing, we reexamined this issue in a strain that had a smooth lipopolysaccharide (LPS) phenotype (E. coli O18:K1:H7 Bort) and in a strain with a deep rough LPS phenotype (E412, spontaneously agglutinable: K1:H-). When cell-associated K1 capsular content was greater than 90 micrograms of K1 polysaccharide per 10(10) CFU, neither strain was lysed by 20% normal human serum. In contrast, at equivalent but lower levels of K1 CP content, E412 but not strain Bort was lysed by normal human serum. Thus, LPS phenotype is an additional surface determinant that affects bacterial susceptibility to killing. Organisms obtained from very early log phase, when cell-associated K1 CP is greatest, were significantly more virulent for mice than were bacteria harvested in stationary phase, when cell-associated K1 polysaccharide is lowest. We conclude that (i) there is a threshold level of K1 CP needed to confer protection from lysis by serum, and this is usually exceeded under standard growth conditions; (ii) at a given level of K1 CP the LPS phenotype is an important determinant of bacterial killing; and (iii) the loss of capsule at low pH may be an additional mechanism by which hosts defend against invasive infection by K1-encapsulated E. coli.', 26386081: StringElement('In primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), the antimitochondrial antibody is a cornerstone of diagnosis, but there have been conflicting reports about the correlation of autoantibodies with disease stage and prognosis.

Combined radionuclide therapy with bisphosphonates has demonstrated improved effectiveness in achieving bone pain palliation in comparison to mono therapy with radionuclides or bisphosphonates alone. However, there are conflicting reports as to whether bisphosphonates adversely influence skeletal uptake of the bone-seeking radiotracers used for therapy. Recent studies analyzing influence of Zoledronic acid on total bone uptake of Samarium-153 EDTMP (Sm-153 EDTMP) by measuring cumulative urinary activity of Sm-153 on baseline study, as well as in combination with bisphosphonates (administrated 48 hours prior to Sm-153) did not provide any statistically significant difference in urinary excretion of Sm-153 between the two groups. It may be noted that the exact temporal sequence of bisphosphonate administration vis a vis radionuclide therapy has not yet been studied. One of the side effects of bisphosphonates is transient flare effect on bone pain. Radionuclide therapy may also have similar side effect. Keeping in view the above the current study was designed with the main objective of determining the exact timing of bisphosphonate administration in patients receiving combined therapy so as to achieve optimal efficacy of bone pain palliation. Ninety-three patients suffering from metastatic bone pain who received combination therapy with Sm-153 oxabifore (an analog of Sm-153 EDTMP) and Zoledronic acid were divided into three groups according to the timing of Zoledronic acid administration: Group I: 39 patients who received Zoledronic acid 7 or more days prior to Sm-153 oxabifore treatment; Group II: 32 patients who received Zoledronic acid 48-72 hours prior to Sm-153 oxabifore treatment and Group III: 22 patients who received Zoledronic acid 7 days after Sm-153 oxabifore treatment. Sm-153 oxabifore was administered to all patients at the standard bone palliation dose of 37 MBq/kg body weight. All patients received Zoledronic acid before and after treatment in standard dosage of 4 mg every 28 days. WB bone scan, CT, and MRI were performed before treatment in all patients to exclude cord compression and vertebral fractures. Pain scores and quality of life (QOL) measurements were recorded meticulously in all patients. In groups I, II, and III, pain relief occurred in 10.4 \\xb1 3.1 (Range = 5-15); 3.1 \\xb1 1.1 (Range = 1-5) and 22 \\xb1 5.1 (Range = 15-35) days, respectively, following radionuclide therapy. There was statistically significant difference between pain score in all groups before and after treatment as well as statistically significant difference in time to pain relief onset between Group II and other groups of patients (P < 0.0001). Based on our results we concluded that administration of Zoledronic acid 48-72 hours prior to Sm-153 oxabifore treatment helps in achieving better pain relief, as well as at the shortest time interval from the start of therapy.', 12138149: 'There have been conflicting reports that kidneys from small donors may be at increased risk for late graft failure if they are transplanted into large recipients. Data from the United States Renal Data System was used to study all first cadaver kidney transplantations performed during the years 1994 to 1999. Donor and recipient body surface area (BSA) combinations were included along with other patient and transplant characteristics in a Poisson analysis of factors associated with early (in the first 4 mo) and late (> or =4 mo) graft failure. The numbers of large (BSA >2.2 m(2)) and medium size (BSA 1.6 to 2.2 m(2)) recipients that received kidneys from small (BSA <1.6 m(2)) donors are less than expected (chi(2) = 118.09; P < 0.0001), suggesting that transplant centers may be refusing some kidneys on the basis of donor-recipient size differences. Large recipients who received kidneys from small donors made up 1.5% of the population and had a 43% (95% CI, 17 to 75%; P = 0.0004) increased risk of late graft failure compared with medium-size recipients who received kidneys from medium-size donors (53.4% of the population). Medium-size recipients who received kidneys from small donors made up 12.0% of the population and had a 16% (95% CI, 6 to 26%; P = 0.0012) increased risk of late graft failure. Disparities in recipient and donor size had similar adverse affects on mortality. Effects of recipient obesity (body mass index) and donor gender on late graft survival were no longer statistically significant after the effects of donor and recipient body size were taken into account. In conclusion, the relative size of the donor and recipient should possibly be taken into account when choosing kidneys for transplantation.', 11861670: 'Due to conflicting reports concerning the relationship between phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) activity and mass in plasma, the protein concentration and activity of PLTP were assessed in fractions isolated by fast protein liquid chromatography from the plasma of healthy normolipidemic individuals. Using both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, PLTP was identified by Western blot analysis after both SDS and non-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, and quantitated by dot blot. PLTP activity was determined using a labeled vesicle/HDL assay. PLTP mass corresponded substantially with the activity distribution using the polyclonal antibody on dot blot with some inactive PLTP being present. However, the monoclonal antibody preferentially reacted with inactive PLTP, primarily associated with LDL and large HDL, overestimating inactive PLTP. Western blot analysis of non-denaturing gradient gels, using the polyclonal antibody, indicated that active PLTP was associated with numerous discrete HDL subpopulations (7.6-12.0 nm) with the major portion being 9-12 nm. Inactive PLTP was associated with particles of 12 to >17 nm. The monoclonal antibody demonstrated a different pattern of reactivity on gradient gels, showing strong reactivity with the inactive PLTP in particles of 12 to >17 nm, but less reactivity with particles of 7.6-12 nm. The differences in reactivities of antibodies for active versus inactive PLTP can account for some of the discrepancies reported in the literature regarding the relationship between PLTP mass and activity.', 2888305: \"Due to conflicting reports in the literature regarding the efficacy of sulfasalazine for Crohn's disease (CD) involving small bowel alone, we reviewed the treatment results of our systematic sulfasalazine treatment in CD over a 23-yr period. We identified 28 patients with CD of small bowel alone treated between 1 and 23 yr by means of sulfasalazine alone and who went into complete clinical remission. Of these, 12 also showed total regression of radiographic abnormalities, 12 showed partial regression, while four patients still await radiographic reexamination. While our data do not permit a precise estimate, it seems that about 25% of patients with small bowel CD respond to sulfasalazine alone. Reasons are discussed why our data are at variance with some and in accord with other reports. While our study of necessity could not be carried out in double-blind fashion, patients served as their own controls, having previously failed to respond to other treatment modalities or no treatment. We conclude that sulfasalazine should be tried in the treatment of CD of small bowel because of its relatively low toxicity and reasonably high efficacy.\", 10395662: \"We have investigated the role of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in the differentiation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells by looking specifically at the effects of inhibitors of MAPK-activating enzyme, MAPK/extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK), during the positive selection step from double-positive to single-positive (SP) thymocytes. Using a variety of transgenic/knockout mouse strain combinations that fail to differentiate individual lineages of SP thymocytes together with genetically engineered F(ab')2 reagents that induce maturation preferentially to either the CD4 or CD8 subpopulations, we show that induction of CD4 differentiation cells is highly sensitive to levels of MEK inhibition that have no effect on CD8 maturation. In addition, the presence of MEK inhibitor is able to modify signals that normally induce CD4 differentiation to instead promote CD8 differentiation. Finally, we show that continuous culture in the presence of inhibitor interferes with TCR up-regulation in SP thymocytes, suggesting that MAPK signaling may be involved in final maturation steps for both lineages. These data indicate that there is discrimination in the biochemical pathways that are necessary to specify CD4 and CD8 lineage commitment and can reconcile previously conflicting reports on the influence of MAPK activation in commitment and maturation of thymocytes.\", 15447724: 'Minoxidil induces new hair growth in approximately one-third of patients with androgenetic alopecia after 1 year of treatment. With several conflicting reports in the literature based on small-scale studies, the current study aimed to clarify whether organ culture of human scalp anagen VI hair follicles is a suitable in vitro test system for reproducing, and experimentally dissecting, the recognized in vivo hair-growth-promoting capacity of minoxidil. Hair shaft elongation was studied in terminal anagen VI hair follicles microdissected from the occipital scalp of 36 healthy adults. A total of 2300 hair follicles, approximately 65 per individual, were tested using modifications of a basic organ culture protocol. It is shown here that minoxidil does not significantly increase hair shaft elongation or the duration of anagen VI in ex vivo culture despite several enhancements on the conventional methodology. This disparity to what is seen clinically in minoxidil responders may be explained by the following: (i) use of occipital (rather than frontotemporal or vertex) hair follicles; (ii) use of, already maximally growing, anagen VI hair follicles; (iii) a predominance of hair follicles from minoxidil unresponsive-donors; (iv) use of minoxidil rather than its sulfate metabolite; and/or (v) use of a suboptimal minoxidil dosage. This disparity questions the usefulness of standard human hair follicle organ culture in minoxidil research. Unexpectedly, minoxidil even inhibited hair shaft elongation in the absence of insulin, which may indicate that the actual hair-growth-modulatory effects of minoxidil depend on the concomitant local presence/absence of other growth modulators.', 2885298: 'To resolve conflicting reports concerning the effects of beta-blockade (BB) on thermoregulatory reflexes during exercise, we studied six fit men during 40 min of cycle ergometer exercise at 60% maximum O2 consumption at ambient temperatures of 22 and 32 degrees C. Two hours before exercise, each subject ingested a capsule containing either 80 mg of propranolol or placebo in single-blind fashion. Heart rate at 40 min of exercise was reduced (P less than 0.01) from 125 to 103 beats min at 22 degrees C and 137 to 104 beats min at 32 degrees C, demonstrating effective BB. After 40 min of exercise, esophageal temperature (Tes) was elevated with BB (P less than 0.05) from 37.66 +/- 0.04 to 38.14 +/- 0.03 and 38.13 +/- 0.04 to 38.41 +/- 0.04 degrees C at 22 and 32 degrees C, respectively. The elevated Tes resulted from a reduced core-to-skin heat flux at both temperatures, indicated by a reduction in the slope of the forearm blood flow (FBF)-Tes relationship, and a decrease in maximal FBF. Systolic blood pressure was decreased 20 mmHg with BB (P less than 0.01), whereas diastolic blood pressure was unchanged, reducing arterial pulse pressure (PP). Because PP was decreased and cardiac filling pressure was presumably not reduced (since cardiac stroke volume was elevated), we suggest that at least a part of the relative increase in peripheral vasomotor tone during BB was the consequence of reduced sinoaortic baroreceptor stimulation.', 9559734: StringElement('To investigate the role of excimer laser keratectomy as a trigger for the reactivation of latent HSV type 1 (HSV-1) in the New Zealand rabbit ocular model.

Insulin resistance commences at around week 12 of gestation in the sow, although there are conflicting reports in the literature about the extent to which insulin resistance is modulated by maternal diet. The aim of the study was to determine the effects of supplementing the maternal diet with different dietary oils during either the first half or the second half of gestation on the glucose tolerance of the sow. Sows were offered the control (C: n = 5) diet as pellets or the C diet plus 10% extra energy (n = 16 per group) derived from either: (i) extra pellets; (ii) palm oil; (iii) olive oil; (iv) sunflower oil; or (v) fish oil. Experimental diets were fed during either the first (G1) or second (G2) half of gestation. A glucose tolerance test (GTT) was conducted on day 108 of gestation by administering 0.5 g/kg glucose i.v. Blood samples were taken every 5 to 10 min for 90 min post administration. The change in body weight and backfat thickness during gestation was similar but both type and timing of dietary supplementation influenced litter size and weight. With the exception of the sunflower oil group, supplementing the maternal diet in G1 resulted in larger and heavier litters, particularly in mothers offered palm oil. Basal blood glucose concentrations tended to be more elevated in G1 than G2 groups, whilst plasma insulin concentrations were similar. Following a GTT, the adjusted area under the curve was greater in G1 compared to G2 sows, despite no differences in glucose clearance. Maternal diet appeared to influence the relationship between glucose curve characteristics following a GTT and litter outcome. In conclusion, the degree of insulin sensitivity can be altered by both the period during which maternal nutritional supplementation is offered and the fatty acid profile of the diet.', 25161402: StringElement('The seroprevalence of anti-H. pylori IgA antibodies has been reported to vary among populations and in relation to strains of Helicobacter pylori bacterium.

In this laboratory/field study from a high-risk area for gastric cancer, we analysed 178 samples of drinking water for nitrate and nitrite, and examined the relationship between gastric mucosal lesions (including gastric cancer) and quality of different types of drinking water and nitrate intake via water. The results showed that the nitrate content in the local drinking water was generally very high, with a mean of 109.6 mg/l (range 4.4-497.2 mg/l). There were significant differences in the nitrate content in drinking water from different wells in qualitatively different types of water. The histological changes were closely related to the quality of drinking water and its nitrate content. The results suggest that nitrate in drinking water probably plays an important role in gastric carcinogenesis and that in future aetiological studies of gastric cancer should include more information on well depth, the presence of public or private wells and nitrate content of water.', 26627776: u\"Spectral contrast effects, the perceptual magnification of spectral differences between sounds, have been widely shown to influence speech categorization. However, whether talker information alters spectral contrast effects was recently debated [Laing, Liu, Lotto, and Holt, Front. Psychol. 3, 1-9 (2012)]. Here, contributions of reliable spectral properties, between-talker and within-talker variability to spectral contrast effects in vowel categorization were investigated. Listeners heard sentences in three conditions (One Talker/One Sentence, One Talker/200 Sentences, 200 Talkers/200 Sentences) followed by a target vowel (varying from /\\u026a/-/\\u025b/ in F1, spoken by a single talker). Low-F1 or high-F1 frequency regions in the sentences were amplified to encourage /\\u025b/ or /\\u026a/ responses, respectively. When sentences contained large reliable spectral peaks (+20\\u2009dB; experiment 1), all contrast effect magnitudes were comparable. Talker information did not alter contrast effects following large spectral peaks, which were likely attributed to an external source (e.g., communication channel) rather than talkers. When sentences contained modest reliable spectral peaks (+5\\u2009dB; experiment 2), contrast effects were smaller following 200 Talkers/200 Sentences compared to single-talker conditions. Constant recalibration to new talkers reduced listeners' sensitivity to modest spectral peaks, diminishing contrast effects.

We demonstrate that the use of a new nested primer pair for CK-19 RT-PCR avoids false positive results without affecting the sensitivity of the assay. Our experiments were carried out using MCF-7 cells alone or mixed with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) of healthy donors.

These deficiencies led to conflicting reports in studies of management of specific venous problems.

Actually it is generally accepted and used. In 2004 an \"ad hoc\" committee of the American Venous Forum working with an international liaison committee, has recommended a number of practical changes, that include a refinement of several definitions used in describing these disorders and a simpler alternative to the full (advanced) CEAP classification, the so called basic CEAP version. The author presents a revision of this document and adapts the nomenclature used to the portuguese language. He gives special attention to the fact that CEAP classification is a descriptive one which is associated to a venous severity and a quality of life scores that are instruments for longitudinal research to assess outcomes.

It is likely that multiple genes play a role in the pathogenesis of these disorders, but no single gene has been identified as causative. Several viruses have been investigated as potential candidates, but conflicting reports exist. Although a relationship between bipolar disorder and schizophrenia with autoimmune disorders has also been documented for many years, reports are often conflicting. We hypothesize that parvovirus B19 (B19), a common human pathogen, due to its ability to infect the brain and induce autoimmunity, is a strong candidate that may unite prevailing theories. In particular, our preliminary data suggest that B19 may be most likely involved in co-morbid bipolar and autoimmune thyroid disorders in females. In schizophrenics, the gender trend may be reversed. We propose that there is a complex interaction between immuno-genetics, autoimmunity, gender, and B19 infection that leads to at least some forms of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.

This study evaluated the cellular and intestinal uptake of inorganic and organic forms of Zn. Steady-state uptake of 65Zn by human intestine epithelial cells, and monkey kidney fibroblasts was not significantly different with zinc chloride (ZnCl2), ZnMet, or zinc propionate (ZnProp) (P > 0.05). Uptake of 65Zn from zinc chelated with EDTA was significantly lower (P < 0.01).

The two cDNAs were transiently expressed in 293T cells, a human kidney cell line. Despite the 90% identity in their sequences, the ligand binding properties of the human and mouse cDNAs expressed in the 293T cell line differed markedly. With respect to amino acid differences in the extracellular loops, four occur in the second extracellular loop, which has been implicated in binding by other studies. The ligand binding characteristics of the recombinant receptors matched those of native receptors from human and mouse adipose tissue. The human A1 receptor cDNA was also expressed in ob17 preadipocyte cells to investigate reported influences of cellular environment on binding characteristics. We compared ligand binding of the expressed receptor in the two cell lines (ob17 and 293T). We also compared ligand binding of native receptors from mouse brain and adipose tissue preparations. In both studies, cellular environment had no affect on binding characteristics. This conclusive evidence resolves earlier conflicting reports in the literature.', 27631337: 'The Wnt signalling receptor receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 2 (ROR2) is implicated in numerous human cancers. However, there have been conflicting reports regarding ROR2 expression, some studies showing upregulation and others downregulation of ROR2 in the same cancer type. The majority of these studies used immunohistochemistry (IHC) to detect ROR2 protein, without validation of the used antibodies. There appears to be currently no consensus on the antibody best suited for ROR2 detection or how ROR2 expression changes in various cancer types. We examined three commercially available ROR2 antibodies and found that only one bound specifically to ROR2. Another antibody cross-reacted with other proteins, and the third failed to detect ROR2 at all. ROR2 detection by IHC on 107 patient samples using the ROR2 specific antibody showed that the majority of colorectal cancers show loss of ROR2 protein. We found no association between ROR2 staining and poor patient survival, as had been previously reported. These results question the previously reported association between ROR2 and poor patient survival in colorectal cancer. Future studies should use fully validated antibodies when detecting ROR2 protein, as non-specific staining can lead to irrelevant observations and misinterpretations.', 12062443: 'Caspases have an active site cysteine whose oxidation blocks catalytic activity. Caspase activity, measured in lysates of apoptotic cells, was inhibited by H2O2 with an IC50 of 7 microM. Recombinant caspase-3 was directly inhibited by H2O2, with an estimated second-order rate constant of 750 M-1 s-1. These values were determined when H2O2 was added while the caspases were cleaving a peptide substrate. There was a 40-fold decrease in sensitivity to inactivation if the substrate was absent at the time of H2O2 addition. These results rationalise conflicting reports of the sensitivity of caspase-3 to H2O2, and identify a novel mechanism for sensitising a thiol enzyme to oxidative inactivation.', 28212981: u'\\xaeUS2 exhibited complete drug release (>80%) even after 6months of storage.', 10952440: 'Brucellosis, caused by bacteria of the genus Brucella, is a contagious disease that causes economic loss to owners of domestic animals due to loss of progeny and milk yield. Because cattle, sheep, goats, and to a lesser extent pigs are considered to be the source of human brucellosis, serological tests have been used to screen domestic animals for antibodies against Brucella. Although the serological tests helped to eradicate brucellosis in many countries, serological tests are not always adequate to detect latent carriers of Brucella. Therefore, the use of the skin delayed-type hypersensitivity (SDTH) test, which is independent of circulating antibodies, might improve the diagnosis of brucellosis. In the literature, however, there are conflicting reports as to the value of the SDTH test for the diagnosis of brucellosis. Some studies consider the test unreliable, whereas others advocate its use because it detects brucellosis earlier than serological tests. The objectives of this study were therefore to assess the characteristics of the SDTH test, to select a Brucella strain that will yield a suitable brucellin for use in the field, and to determine whether the use of serological tests in combination with the SDTH test improves the detection of brucellosis. The results of this study clearly show that the SDTH test detects latent carriers of Brucella and confirms brucellosis in cattle with ambiguous serological test results. Brucellins prepared from smooth or mucoid strains of Brucella are better suited for use in the field than brucellins prepared from rough strains because they detect brucellosis in cattle with acute as well as chronic infection. The SDTH test is highly specific (99.3% specificity), and repeated testing of naive cattle or cattle infected with microorganisms that serologically cross-react with Brucella does not sensitize cattle to subsequent SDTH tests. However, it is possible that some naive cattle may serologically react to the injection of brucellin. The effect of these serological reactions on the sero-diagnosis of brucellosis is limited, because cattle may only now and then react serologically either with the serum agglutination test (SAT) or the complement fixation test (CFT). Nevertheless, cattle infected with microorganisms that serologically cross-react with Brucella may test seropositive for brucellosis 4 to 7 weeks after injection of brucellin, depending on the cross-reacting microorganism. The value of the SDTH test for the diagnosis of brucellosis was demonstrated after an outbreak of brucellosis. When the SDTH test was used in combination with SAT and CFT at diagnostic threshold > or =2 mm or > or =1 mm (increase in skinfold thickness), respectively, 39/44 (88%) or 42/44 (95%) of the infected cattle were detected compared with only 27/44 (61%) when SAT and CFT were used. When cattle in areas of low prevalence or in areas free from brucellosis are tested with the SDTH test an increase > or =2 mm in skinfold thickness should be considered indicative of infection. When the control and eradication of brucellosis is based on test-and-slaughter, an increase of > or =1 mm in skinfold thickness should be considered indicative of infection. Repeated serological testing complemented with the SDTH test in this programme will shorten the quarantine (movement control) period of a suspect herd, limiting the financial loss incurred during outbreaks of the disease. Consequently, since the SDTH test usually does not interfere with the serological diagnosis and can safely be used to establish the infection status of cattle in a suspect herd, it is opportune to consider adding the SDTH test to the procedure currently used to diagnose brucellosis in individual animals.', 21116666: u'Little is known about the practices of primary care physicians regarding the prescribing of antidepressants during pregnancy.

The role of sIgA in defending the eye against pathogens has not been established clearly. There have been conflicting reports about the effect of contact lens wear on the concentration of sIgA in tears. This study was conducted to elucidate the role of sIgA in ocular defence and to determine the effect of contact lens wear on sIgA concentration. METHODS: Tears were collected from contact lens wearers and non-wearers using micro-capillary tubes. The concentration of sIgA was evaluated using an in-house ELISA. The specificity of sIgA to a strain of P. aeruginosa was examined using a fluorescent assay and the ability of neutrophils to phagocytose sIgA coated bacteria were assessed by plate counts. RESULTS: Tears contained sIgA that reacted to P. aeruginosa. P. aeruginosa coated with sIgA was phagocytosed by the neutrophils. The level of sIgA and the level of sIgA specific to P. aeruginosa in the tears of contact lens wearers were significantly reduced. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that contact lens wear significantly alters the level of sIgA in tears which may lead to changes in the ability of the ocular surface to defend itself against potential pathogens.', 20401920: 'Anastomotic complications are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality following esophagectomy for cancer.

To investigate changes which result from the method of preparation, test samples must be produced with similar mechanical properties to minimise variations other than those resulting from treatment. We describe a new method for the comparative measurement of bone strength using standard bone samples. We used 233 samples from six cadavers to study the effects of irradiation at a standard dose (28 kGy) alone and combined with deep freezing. We also investigated the effects of varying the dose from 6.8 to 60 kGy (n = 132). None of the treatments had any effect on the elastic behaviour of the samples, but there was a reduction in strength to 64% of control values (p < 0.01) after irradiation with 28 kGy. There was also a dose-dependent reduction in strength and in the ability of the samples to absorb work before failure. We suggest that irradiation may cause an alteration in the bone matrix of allograft bone, but provided it is used in situations in which loading is within its elastic region, then failure should not occur.', 14726922: StringElement('For most multiuse aqueous nasal, ophthalmic, and otic products, benzalkonium chloride (BKC) is the preservative of choice.

One meta-analysis reported a 1% absolute increase in the incidence of cancer associated with ARBs over 4 years. Contrasting findings were reported in an industry-sponsored meta-analysis and in another meta-analysis, both of which showed no difference in the incidence of cancer in ARB treatment groups relative to control groups. The US Food and Drug Administration has recently asserted that evidence does not support an association between ARBs and the development of cancer. The current review compares the 3 published meta-analyses assessing the association between ARBs and cancer and shows that outcome reporting bias contributed to the conflicting results. Given the prevalence of this form of bias in the scientific literature, the processes for systematic reviews and meta-analyses are under siege, and there is an important role for health care regulators to play. If all outcome data from clinical trials were to be reported in the public domain, independent analyses could be performed and the results of industry-sponsored trials verified. Furthermore, if regulators were to mandate the publication, in the public domain, of all clinical outcomes collected in clinical trials, outcome reporting bias could be eliminated.', 28524302: u'There are conflicting reports about the nature and magnitude of hemoglobin (Hb) differences between African Americans (AA) and European Americans (EA). Several reports suggest that AA have lower mean Hb values and that differences between AA and EA are large and are due to \"racial\" differences. Some have even called for separate Hb standards. In this study, Hb comparisons were made between AA and EA males in the Second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1976-1980. Comparison of AA and EA males with normal Hb values (i.e., 13.0 g/dl or greater) indicated that observed mean Hb differences exist primarily at the lower end of the Hb distribution (i.e., the distribution is skewed to the left). Several factors are likely contributors to lower hemoglobin values at the lower end of the distribution, including hemoglobinopathies, thalassemias, and/or nutritional deficiencies. If racial differences exist between these groups, controlled prospective studies are necessary to demonstrate this possibility. This study supports a single Hb standard for AA and EA males. \\xa9 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc.', 16971535: 'The actions of the neuropoietic cytokines are mediated by the gp130 receptor, which activates several signaling molecules including the transcription factor STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription), which, in turn, is subject to feedback inhibition by SOCS3 (suppressor of cytokine signaling). Activation of the gp130 receptor has been implicated in axonal growth particularly during regeneration, but the specific contribution of STAT3 is the subject of conflicting reports. Measurements of SOCS3 mRNA in rat dorsal root ganglia showed a significant induction in this inhibitory molecule after peripheral nerve injury. The functions of STAT3 and SOCS3 in adult rat primary sensory neurons were investigated in vitro through transduction of lentiviruses yielding a conditionally activated STAT3, native SOCS3, or a mutant SOCS3 with dominant-negative actions. The SOCS3 construct was effective in inhibiting tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in a neuroblastoma cell line and in blocking nuclear accumulation of endogenous STAT3 or of the conditionally activated STAT3 chimera in primary sensory neurons. In such neurons, transduction and activation of STAT3 enhanced neurite growth, transduction with SOCS3 reduced neurite outgrowth, and transduction with mutant SOCS3 enhanced neurite growth, at least under basal conditions. In conclusion, STAT3 signaling is beneficial to axonal growth through activating transcription of unidentified genes, and SOCS3 is detrimental to axonal growth through inhibition of STAT3 and/or other transcription factors.', 12115728: \"Conflicting reports have attributed 8-chloro-cAMP (Cl-cAMP)-mediated inhibition of tumor cell growth to either a toxic 8-chloro-adenosine (Cl-AdR) breakdown product or a Cl-cAMP-mediated decrease in ratio of Type I to Type II regulatory (R) subunits of protein kinase A (PKA). Using the MCF-7 human breast cancer and S49 mouse lymphoma cell lines as models, we show that the effects of Cl-cAMP and other cAMP analogs on growth and R subunit expression are unrelated. MCF-7 cell growth was insensitive to most analogs and inducers of cAMP, but was potently inhibited by Cl-cAMP acting through uptake and phosphorylation of its Cl-AdR breakdown product. Possible roles of adenosine receptors or P(2) purinoceptors in these Cl-cAMP-mediated growth effects were ruled out by studies with agonists and antagonists. Cholera toxin markedly decreased the ratio of Type I to Type II R subunits in MCF-7 cells without affecting growth, while growth inhibitory concentrations of Cl-cAMP or Cl-AdR had insignificant effects on this ratio. In S49 cells, where PKA activation is known to inhibit cell growth, PKA-deficient mutants retained sensitivity to both Cl-cAMP and the related 8-bromo-cAMP. Adenosine kinase (AK)-deficient S49 cells were inhibited only by higher concentrations of these 8-halogenated cAMP analogs. Of the commonly used cAMP analogs, only 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP acted purely as a cyclic nucleotide-having no effect on PKA-deficient cells, but strongly inhibiting both wild-type and AK-deficient cells. Where growth inhibitory concentrations of most cAMP analogs reduced RI expression in the AK-deficient mutant, a functionally equivalent concentration of (N(6), O(2'))dibutyryl-cAMP maintained or increased this expression.\", 792343: 'An analysis of the fundamental physical chemical limits of hemolytic plaque inhibition as a method for obtaining thermodynamic and kinetic information is presented. It is shown that inhibition curve characteristics will be sensitive functions of reaction affinities only when the antibody inhibitor and antibody red blood cell reaction mechanisms are related in certain ways. It is further shown that conditions which are most sensititive to IgG affinity changes will generally not be the best for detecting changes in IgM affinity. The apparently conflicting reports on IgM maturation are completely explicable in terms of experimental requirements imposed by physical chemical characteristics of the reaction. Experiments in which maturation is observed are found to conform to the most sensitive conditions of the assay, whereas those in which it is not observed are found to conform to relatively insensitive conditions, and would therefore be capable of registering changes only when affinity shifts are large.', 8625945: 'Little is known at the molecular level concerning the genotoxic effects following the acute exposure of eukaryotic cells to low concentrations of lead (II) or mercury (II). There have been conflicting reports concerning the mutagenic potential of these heavy metals, and there have not been any studies performed to determine the molecular mechanism(s) by which these metals are mutagenic. The Chinese hamster ovary cell line, AS52, contains a stably integrated single functional copy of the Escherichia coli xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (gpt) gene. Mutations in the gpt gene confer resistance to 6-thioguanine (TG). There was little effect on viability, as measured by relative cloning efficiency, of AS52 cells exposed to lead (II) or mercury (II) up to concentrations of 0.5 microM and 0.3 microM, respectively. However, higher concentrations of the metals caused a significant increase in cell death. There was also a dose-dependent increase in the isolation of mutants resistant to TG in treated cells when compared to non-treated controls. Concentrations of the metals as low as 0.1 microM caused a significant increase in the number of mutants resistant to TG when compared to the number of spontaneous mutants obtained in nontreated controls.

Through a comparative analysis of regulatory T (Treg) and IL-10-producing type 1 regulatory T (Tr1) cells, we hypothesized that Tr1 cells enhance the immunoregulatory functions of MSCs, and that a combinatorial approach to cell therapy may exert synergistic immunomodulatory effects in an experimental animal model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A combination of MSCs and Tr1 cells prevented the development of destructive arthritis compared to single cell therapy. These therapeutic effects were associated with an increase in type II collagen (CII)-specific CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Treg cells and inhibition of CII-specific CD4+IL-17+ T cells. We observed that Tr1 cells produce high levels of IL-10-dependent interferon (IFN)-\\u03b2, which induces toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 expression in MSCs. Moreover, induction of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) by TLR3 involved an autocrine IFN-\\u03b2 that was dependent on STAT1 signaling. Furthermore, we observed that production of IFN-\\u03b2 and IL-10 in Tr1 cells synergistically induces IDO in MSCs through the STAT1 pathway. These findings suggest co-administration of MSCs and Tr1 cells to be a novel therapeutic modality for clinical autoimmune diseases.', 21198622: u'Archived slides of cell smears treated with histological stains for sperm detection are often the only source of DNA available when cold cases are reopened.

Vitamin D deficiency was associated in the total population with a lower percentage of actively proliferating cells and with a lack of differentiation markers. Study of the isolated cell populations demonstrated, however, that small cells were actively proliferating, whereas they were mainly in the resting stage in the normal epidermis. Treatment with vitamin D dramatically increased cell proliferation and stimulated the appearance of differentiation markers. Some of the observed effects, such as an increase in proliferation and the appearance of epidermal calcium binding protein, were due to the normalisation of the vitamin D deficiency-induced hypocalcemia, whereas the expression of suprabasal keratins was directly dependent on vitamin D. We conclude that the action of vitamin D on the epidermis is associated with increases in both proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes.

Because of conflicting reports in the literature on the question whether ICAM-1 is exclusively expressed in pneumocytes Type I or also in pneumocytes Type II, the present study aimed at characterising the cell types in normal human alveolar epithelium which show immunoreactivity for ICAM-1. Immunohistochemistry for ICAM-1 was performed on a series of 19 specimens of normal human lung. In addition, double staining procedures of ICAM-1 together with cell type specific antigens were performed. To detect pneumocytes Type II an antibody to cytokeratin 18 (CK 18) was used. Alveolar macrophages were marked by an antibody to the monocyte macrophage-specific leukocyte antigen CD 68. Vascular endothelium was stained by common endothelial markers (Ulex europaeus agglutinin Type I, anti-von Willebrand factor). The alveolar septa showed intense surface staining for ICAM-1 that could be localised predominantly to pneumocytes Type I. There were also single ICAM-1 positive cells having the characteristics of pneumocytes Type II in respect of their morphological appearance and their cytokeratin pattern. For the interpretation of these results the fact had to be considered that pneumocytes Type I can partly cover up pneumocytes Type II. This was confirmed by ultrastructural observations.

NAADP-induced Ca(2+) release was almost entirely blocked by TPEN (IC(50) 17-25\\u03bcM) which suppressed the maximal extent of Ca(2+) release without altering NAADP sensitivity. In contrast, Ca(2+) release via IP(3) receptors was 3- to 30-fold less sensitive to TPEN whereas that evoked by ionomycin was essentially unaffected. The effect of TPEN on NAADP-induced Ca(2+) release was not due to an increase in the luminal pH or chelation of trace metals since it could not be mimicked by NH(4)Cl or phenanthroline. The fact that TPEN had no effect upon ionophore-induced Ca(2+) release also argued against a substantial reduction in the driving force for Ca(2+) efflux.

The use of nasal spray for administering OT in behavioral research has become a standard method, but many questions still exist regarding its action. OT is a peptide that cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, and it has yet to be shown that it does indeed reach the brain when delivered intranasally. Given the evidence, it seems highly likely that OT does affect behavior when delivered as a nasal spray. These effects may be driven by at least three possible mechanisms. First, the intranasally delivered OT may diffuse directly into the CNS where it directly engages OT receptors. Second, the intranasally delivered OT may trigger increased central release via an indirect peripheral mechanism. And third, the indirect peripheral effects may directly lead to behavioral effects via some mechanism other than increased central release. Although intranasally delivered OT likely affects behavior, there are conflicting reports as to the exact nature of those behavioral changes: some studies suggest that OT effects are not always \"pro-social\" and others suggest effects on social behaviors are due to a more general anxiolytic effect. In this critique, we draw from work in healthy human populations and the animal literature to review the mechanistic aspects of intranasal OT delivery, and to discuss intranasal OT effects on social cognition and behavior.

Because SSCs are the only stem cells in the body that transmit genetic information to the next generation, they are an attractive target for germline modification. Although several virus vectors have been successfully used to transduce SSCs, cell toxicity or insertional mutagenesis of the transgene has limited their usage. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is unique among virus vectors because of its target specificity and low toxicity in somatic cells, and clinical trials have shown that it has promise for gene therapy. However, there are conflicting reports on the possibility of germline integration of AAV into the genome of male germ cells, including SSCs. Here, we examined the usefulness of AAV vectors for exploring germline gene modification in SSCs. AAV1 infected cultured SSCs without apparent toxicity. Moreover, SSCs that were infected in fresh testis cells generated normal appearing spermatogenic colonies after spermatogonial transplantation. A microinsemination experiment produced offspring that underwent excision of the floxed target gene by AAV1-mediated Cre expression. Analysis of the offspring DNA showed no evidence of AAV integration, suggesting a low risk of germline integration by AAV infection. Although more extensive experiments are required to assess the risk of germline integration, our results show that AAV1 is useful for genetic manipulation of SSCs, and gene transduction by AAV will provide a useful approach to overcome potential problems associated with previous virus vector-mediated gene transduction.', 9362058: 'Transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) family ligands initiate a cascade of events capable of modulating cellular growth and differentiation.

To address the fate of ligand-activated receptors, we have used our previously characterized chimeric receptors consisting of the ligand binding domain from the granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor alpha or beta receptor fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain of the type I or type II TGF beta receptor. This system not only provides the necessary sensitivity and specificity to address these types of questions but also permits the differentiation of endocytic responses to either homomeric or heteromeric intracellular TGF beta receptor oligomerization. Data are presented that show, within minutes of ligand binding, chimeric TGF beta receptors are internalized. However, although all the chimeric receptor combinations show similar internalization rates, receptor down-regulation occurs only after activation of heteromeric TGF beta receptors. These results indicate that effective receptor down-regulation requires cross-talk between the type I and type II TGF beta receptors and that TGF beta receptor heteromers and homomers show distinct trafficking behavior.', 1552190: 'Recent studies using biotinylated in situ hybridization (ISH) have utilized a wide range of detection protocols for the biotinylated hybrids, leading to conflicting reports in the literature regarding sensitivity. In this study we compared 11 different detection protocols for biotinylated ISH using a measles virus-specific RNA probe on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded central nervous system tissue infected with measles virus. Maximum sensitivity was achieved with five-step detection protocols incorporating the use of a monoclonal antibody to biotin. Single-step detection protocols were found to be insensitive, as shown by their failure to detect viral nucleic acid in infected white-matter cells. Only by increasing the number of steps in the detection protocols were these infected cells demonstrable. Unless pre-hybridization, hybridization, and detection protocols are optimized, the results obtained in pathogenicity studies using ISH could be misinterpreted, leading to false conclusions about nucleic acid distribution. This also applies to the ever-increasing use of ISH for diagnostic purposes.', 24035139: 'Asthma is a heterogeneous disease with many different phenotypes. Moderate and severe asthma phenotypes have been associated with increased neutrophils and increased Th17 cytokines, IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22, in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients. Th17 cytokines recruit neutrophils to the airway by increasing secretion of epithelial-derived neutrophilic chemokines. In addition, Th17 cytokines also induce mucous cell metaplasia and have pleotropic effects on airway smooth muscle resulting in airway narrowing. The role of Th17 cytokines in regulating Th2 cytokine expression and allergic airway inflammation remains unclear with conflicting reports. However, the role of Th17 cells in asthma will be answered in ongoing clinical trials with therapeutics targeting IL-17A and IL-17 receptor signaling.', 12466486: 'In dengue virus (DEN) particles, the core protein is a structural protein of the nucleocapsid. The core protein is known to be present in the nucleus of DEN-infected cells but there have been conflicting reports as to whether it is also present in the nucleolus. To clarify this, the intracellular location of the core protein was examined using a monoclonal antibody, 15B11, which was produced in this study. Immunofluorescence staining with this antibody demonstrated that the core protein first appeared in the cytoplasm and then in the nuclei and nucleoli of infected cells. Nuclear localization of the core protein was determined to be independent of other DEN proteins, since recombinant core proteins still entered the nuclei and nucleoli of cells transfected with only the core protein gene. Three putative nuclear localization signal motifs have been predicted to be present on the core protein. Deletion of the first one (KKAR), located at aa 6-9, and mutation of the second one (KKSK), located at aa 73-76, did not eliminate the nuclear localization property of the core protein. The third motif with a bipartite structure, RKeigrmlnilnRRRR, located at aa 85-100, was determined to be responsible for the nuclear localization of the core protein, since the core protein without this motif was located exclusively in the cytoplasm of DEN-infected cells and that this motif mediated nuclear localization of a normally cytoplasmic protein.', 29488875: StringElement('There are conflicting reports with regard to the relationship between suicidal ideations and tinnitus and hyperacusis.

A post hoc analysis of the Captopril and Thrombolysis Study (CATS) study was conducted. At randomization, 94 patients (31.5%) took aspirin. In patients who took aspirin, the cumulative alpha-hydroxy butyrate dehydrogenase release was 1,151 +/- 132 IU/L in patients randomized to captopril compared with 1,401 +/- 136 IU/L in patients randomized to placebo (difference -250 +/- 189 [95% confidence interval (CI) -620 to 120]). This difference was comparable to the difference in patients who did not use aspirin (-199 +/- 147 [95% CI -488 to 897]). One year after acute myocardial infarction, an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic volume index of 2.2 +/- 3.0 ml/m2 in captopril-treated and 1.9 +/- 2.9 ml/m2 in placebo-treated patients was observed in patients who took aspirin (difference 0.4 +/- 4.2 [95% CI -8.2 to 8.9]). This difference was also comparable to the difference in patients who did not take aspirin (2.2 +/- 3.8 [95% CI -5.2 to 9.7]). One year after acute myocardial infarction, patients who did take aspirin had a mean change in LV end-diastolic volume index of 2.1 +/- 2.1 ml/m2 compared with 8.4 +/- 1.9 ml/m2 in patients who did not use aspirin (p = 0.02). Thus, aspirin does not attenuate the acute and long-term effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition after acute myocardial infarction, but independently reduces LV dilation after myocardial infarction.', 9742158: 'During embryonic development, most neuronal populations undergo a process usually referred to as naturally occurring neuronal death. For motoneurons (MTNs) of the lumbar spinal cord of chick embryos, this process takes place in a well defined period of time, between embryonic days 6 and 10 (E6-E10). Neurotrophins (NTs) are the best characterized family of neurotrophic factors and exert their effects through activation of their specific Trk receptors. In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that rodent motoneurons survive in response to BDNF, NT3, and NT4/5. In contrast, the trophic dependencies of chicken motoneurons have been difficult to elucidate, and various apparently conflicting reports have been published. In the present study, we describe how freshly isolated motoneurons from E5.5 chick embryos did not respond to any neurotrophin in vitro. Yet, because motoneurons were maintained alive in culture in the presence of muscle extract, they developed a delayed specific survival response to BDNF, NT3, and NT4/5 that is clearly dose-dependent, reaching saturation at doses of 100 pg/ml. This trophic response correlated with increasing expression of the corresponding functional receptors TrkB and TrkC. Moreover, TrkB receptor is able to become autophosphorylated and to activate classical intracellular signaling pathways such as the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase when it is stimulated with its cognate ligand BDNF. Therefore, our results reconcile the reported differences between in vivo and in vitro studies on the ability of chicken MTNs to respond to some members of the neurotrophin family of trophic factors.', 24618833: 'The evaluation of engineered nanomaterial safety has been hindered by conflicting reports demonstrating differential degrees of toxicity with the same nanoparticles. The unique properties of these materials increase the likelihood that they will interfere with analytical techniques, which may contribute to this phenomenon. We tested the potential for: 1) nanoparticle intrinsic fluorescence/absorbance, 2) interactions between nanoparticles and assay components, and 3) the effects of adding both nanoparticles and analytes to an assay, to interfere with the accurate assessment of toxicity. Silicon, cadmium selenide, titanium dioxide, and helical rosette nanotubes each affected at least one of the six assays tested, resulting in either substantial over- or under-estimations of toxicity. Simulation of realistic assay conditions revealed that interference could not be predicted solely by interactions between nanoparticles and assay components. Moreover, the nature and degree of interference cannot be predicted solely based on our current understanding of nanomaterial behaviour. A literature survey indicated that ca. 95% of papers from 2010 using biochemical techniques to assess nanotoxicity did not account for potential interference of nanoparticles, and this number had not substantially improved in 2012. We provide guidance on avoiding and/or controlling for such interference to improve the accuracy of nanotoxicity assessments.', 1697618: \"Conflicting reports in the literature regarding the sensitivity and specificity of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) stain in establishing or excluding the diagnosis of Hirschsprung's disease (HD) prompted this review of 497 rectal biopsies performed on 455 children.

In this series, however, there were eight children with HD, and nine without HD in whom the AChE-stained portion of the sample provided invaluable diagnostic information not obtained from the concomitant, formalin-fixed, H&E-stained portion of the sample.

The complete 3 dimensional set of isoboles in the dose range under study was generated by a microcomputer-based method. We found that the combination effects of 8-hr sequential FUra-MTX, simultaneous administration of MTX-FUra, and 8-hr sequential MTX-FUra were clearly antagonistic for all 3 cell lines. In contrast, the combination cytotoxic effects of 24-hr sequential MTX-FUra were much more active. Our in vitro model thus clearly shows that MTX-FUra interactions are highly schedule-dependent. This provides a rational basis for testing sequential MTX-FUra with a longer administration interval than usually employed clinically.', 16787286: 'An analysis of current literature on sexual dimorphism in response to trauma-hemorrhage revealed conflicting reports on the role of gender in outcomes of trauma patients. In contrast, results obtained from experimental studies clearly support the suggestion that gender plays a significant role in post injury pathogenesis. As discussed in this review, experimental studies suggest that the suppression of immune and cardiac function is severe in males and ovariectomized females; however, both immune and cardiac functions are maintained in proestrus females. Furthermore, findings from a number of studies have shown that the depletion of male sex hormones by castration or by blocking the interaction between male sex steroids and their receptors in males prevented the suppression of both immune and cardiac functions following trauma-hemorrhage. Moreover, administration of estrogen in males and ovariectomized females also prevented the suppression of immune and cardiac functions following trauma-hemorrhage. Thus, these experimental findings collectively suggest that female sex hormones (i.e., estrogen) produce salutary effects following trauma-hemorrhage whereas male sex steroids (i.e. 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone, 5alpha-DHT) are suppressive to immune and cardiac functions under those conditions. Such dramatic differences in the outcome of trauma-hemorrhage in proestrus females and males clearly suggest that the prevailing sex hormonal levels at the time of injury play a critical role in shaping the host response to trauma-hemorrhage. While a definitive cause for the conflicting data obtained in the clinical setting remains to be established, the discrepancy could be due to the differences in the hormonal levels at the time of injury. Since there is no information on hormonal status in the clinical studies, it is difficult to ascertain the role of sex hormones in post trauma pathogenesis. Therefore, in order to establish the role of gender in the outcome of trauma patients, more planned studies are needed in which the levels of sex hormones should be measured at the time of hospital admission. Furthermore, more studies, both in the clinical and experimental settings, should be performed to determine the mechanism by which the sex hormones improve immune and organ functions following trauma-hemorrhage. The findings obtained from these studies will help in designing innovative therapeutic approaches for the treatment of trauma patients.', 16840535: 'Insulin inhibits transcription of the genes encoding the glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit (G6Pase), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and IGF binding protein-1 through insulin response sequences (IRSs) that share the same core sequence, T(G/A)TTTT(G/T). The transcription factors FOXO1a and FOXO3a have been shown to bind these elements, but there are conflicting reports as to whether this binding correlates with the action of insulin on gene transcription. Some researchers concluded, from overexpression experiments using FOXO1a, that binding correlated with the insulin response, whereas others concluded, mainly from gel retardation competition experiments using FOXO3a, that it did not. We show here that, although these factors can differentially activate gene transcription in a context-dependent manner, these conflicting data are not explained by a difference in FOXO1a and FOXO3a binding specificity. Instead, we find that gel retardation competition and binding experiments give different results; the latter reveal a correlation between FOXO1a/3a binding and the inhibition of basal G6Pase gene transcription by insulin. In addition, these data show that the binding of FOXO1a/3a to two adjacent IRSs in the G6Pase promoter is cooperative and that promoter context alters the specific IRS base requirements for FOXO1a-stimulated fusion gene expression. Surprisingly, an analysis of insulin action mediated through the G6Pase and IGF binding protein-1 IRSs in the context of a heterologous thymidine kinase promoter reveals that signaling through the latter does not support the accepted model for insulin-stimulated FOXO nuclear exclusion.', 2019161: 'Conflicting reports have appeared concerning the role of anticholinergic agents in the treatment of acute asthma. This study was designed to determine whether atropine sulfate, the only anticholinergic agent currently available in the United States for nebulization, increases bronchodilation when added to an inhaled beta-adrenergic agonist during the initial treatment of an acute asthma attack. Adults asthmatics (n = 40) with acute asthma attacks were randomized to receive metaproterenol (5 percent solution, 0.3 ml) either alone or with atropine sulfate (2.5 mg), by nebulization. Spirometry, vital signs, and the presence of side effects 0, 30, 60, and 120 minutes after treatment were determined. There were no significant differences between the metaproterenol alone and metaproterenol plus atropine sulfate groups in regard to age, duration of asthma, baseline spirometry, or side effects. No differences were noted between the two groups regarding changes in FEV1 and FVC from baseline (expressed in milliliters or as a percentage of baseline) during the observation period. We conclude that nebulized atropine sulfate yields no additional benefit when added to metaproterenol during the initial treatment of an acute asthma attack.', 21225307: 'In this review article, the clinical and histopathological characteristics of oral premalignant lesions, and primarily oral leukoplakia, are noted and the risk factors for malignant transformation of oral leukoplakia are discussed. Malignant transformation rates of oral leukoplakia range from 0.13 to 17.5%. The risk factors of malignant transformation in the buccal mucosa and labial commissure are male gender with chewing tobacco or smoking in some countries such as India, or older age and/or being a non-smoking female in other countries. Some authors have reported that leukoplakia on the tongue or the floor of the mouth showed a high risk of malignant transformation, although others have found no oral subsites at high risk. In concurrence with some authors, the authors of this review view epithelial dysplasia as an important risk factor in malignant transformation; however, there are conflicting reports in the literature. Many authors believe that nonhomogeneous leukoplakia is a high risk factor without exception, although different terms have been used to describe those conditions. The large size of lesions and widespread leukoplakia are also reported risk factors. According to some studies, surgical treatment decreased the rate of malignant transformation; however, many review articles state that no definitive treatment including surgery can decrease the malignant transformation rate of oral leukoplakia because of the lack of randomized control trials of treatment. Tobacco chewing and smoking may be causative agents for cancerization of oral leukoplakia in some groups, and evidence for a role of human papilloma virus in the malignant transformation of oral leukoplakia is inconsistent. Further research to clarify its role in malignant transformation is warranted.', 25007965: u'Though the role of Estrogen Receptor (ER)\\u03b1 in breast cancer has been studied extensively, there is little consensus about the role of alternative ER isoform ER\\u03b2 in breast cancer biology. ER\\u03b2 has significant sequence homology to ER\\u03b1 but is located on a different chromosome and maintains both overlapping and unique functional attributes. Five variants exist, resulting from alternative splicing of the C-terminal region of ER\\u03b2. The relevance of ER\\u03b2 variants in breast cancer outcomes and response to therapy is difficult to assess because of conflicting reports in the literature, likely due to variable methods used to assess ER\\u03b2 in patient tumors. Here, we quantitatively assess expression of ER\\u03b2 splice variants on over 2,000 breast cancer patient samples. Antibodies against ER\\u03b2 variants were validated for staining specificity in cell lines by siRNA knockdown of ESR2 and staining reproducibility on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue by quantitative immunofluorescence (QIF) using AQUA technology. We found antibodies against splice variants ER\\u03b21 and ER\\u03b25, but not ER\\u03b22/cx, which were sensitive, specific, and reproducible. QIF staining of validated antibodies showed both ER\\u03b21 and ER\\u03b25 QIF scores, which have a normal (bell shaped) distribution on most cohorts assessed, and their expression is significantly associated with each other. Extensive survival analyses show that ER\\u03b21 is not a prognostic or predictive biomarker for breast cancer. ER\\u03b25 appears to be a context-dependent marker of worse outcome in HER2-positive and triple-negative patients, suggesting an unknown biological function in the absence of ER\\u03b1.', 23684959: u'End-stage renal failure deteriorates bone mass and increases fracture risk. However, there are conflicting reports in the literature regarding the effects of mild to moderate renal dysfunction on bone mineral density (BMD). We investigated the association between renal function and BMD at the spine and hip and bone metabolism markers in community-dwelling elderly Japanese men. From 2174 male volunteers aged \\u226565 years, we examined 1477 men after excluding those with diseases or medications known to affect bone metabolism. Renal function was assessed by serum cystatin C and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation. Bone metabolism was evaluated using levels of serum amino-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PINP) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase isoenzyme 5b (TRACP-5b), which represent bone metabolic status independent of renal function. eGFR was inversely associated with BMD after adjusting for potential confounders (P < 0.01). Cystatin C showed a weaker but significant association with BMD. eGFR was modestly positively associated with PINP levels (P = 0.04), although cystatin C concentrations were neither associated with PINP nor TRACP-5b levels. Since BMD integrates bone metabolism from the past to present, inverse associations between renal function and BMD may be attributed to past factors, such as obesity. Our findings suggest that low renal function does not affect bone metabolism in a population of community-dwelling elderly Japanese men. Longitudinal studies will be necessary to clarify whether low renal function affects bone loss.', 8701792: 'A woman presented with a pituitary macroadenoma with extensive suprasellar extension.

There have been conflicting reports regarding the growth of pituitary tumors in pregnancy. Most recognize that some growth may occur, but only a small percentage of patients are reported to become symptomatic from the growth. Resistance to bromocriptine has been reported in non-pregnant patients. Patients who have had surgery or radiation therapy and did not receive bromocriptine treatment during pregnancy have been reported to have symptomatic growth of their residual tumor.

Formononetin is an isoflavone with known estrogen-like activity. This compound was first reported to be isolated from black cohosh in 1985, but subsequent research in 2002 using HPLC-PDA and LC-MS revealed no evidence to show the presence of formononetin in 13 populations of American black cohosh. A more recent report published in 2004 claimed to detect formononetin in an extract of black cohosh rhizomes using a TLC-fluorescent densitometry method. To further resolve these conflicting reports, we analyzed black cohosh roots and rhizomes for the presence of formononetin, using a combined TLC, HPLC-PDA and LC-MS method. We examined both methanolic and aqueous methanolic black cohosh extracts by HPLC-PDA and LC-MS methods, and did not detect formononetin in any extracts. We further determined the limits of detection of formononetin by HPLC-PDA and LC-MS. Our experimental results indicated that the sensitivity and accuracy of the HPLC-PDA and LC-MS methods for the analysis of formononetin were slightly higher than those of the reported fluorescent method, suggesting that the HPLC-PDA and LC-MS methods were reliable for the analysis of formononetin from black cohosh. We also repeated the reported TLC method to concentrate two fractions from a modern black cohosh sample and an 86-year-old black cohosh sample, respectively, and then analyzed these two fractions for formononetin using the HPLC-PDA and LC-MS method instead of the fluorescent method. Formononetin was not detected by HPLC-PDA or LC-MS. From the results of the present study it is not reasonable to attribute the estrogen-like activity of black cohosh extracts to formononetin.', 26924347: u'There are conflicting reports concerning the association of Toxoplasma gondii infection with increased risk of mental disorders. This investigation will provide a good understanding about defining the possible association between T. gondii exposure and risk of anxiety and cognitive alterations. Besides, a secondary objective of this study was to determine the effect of pioglitazone administration on the possible alterations induced by T. gondii exposure. Male BALB/c mice were used for this study. The animal model of Toxoplasma infection was established by the intraperitoneal inoculation of 20-25 tissue cysts from Tehran strain of T. gondii. Pioglitazone (20 mg/kg, i.p.1/day) was administered to the animals for 2 weeks before behavioural tests. Behavioural tests including open-field, elevated plus-maze and passive avoidance learning were evaluated in the groups. Since cytokines were implicated as a contributing factor for mood disorders, the mRNA levels of TNF-\\u03b1, IL-1\\u03b2, IL-6 as well as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOs) were examined by real-time PCR. Findings demonstrated that T. gondii caused anxiety-like symptoms and impaired cognitive functions of the infected BALB/c mice, whereas pioglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonist, showed a promising effect against the cognitive impairments induced by Toxoplasma infection. The results also revealed that the mRNA levels of the aforementioned cytokines were significantly (p < 0.05) increased in the infected mice compared to the uninfected BALB/c ones. Pioglitazone can be offered as a potential neuroprotective agent in the treatment of patients with T. gondii infection that manifests anxiety and cognitive impairments; however, further studies are needed to clarify the exact mechanisms.', 24643428: StringElement('The exercise test is a powerful non-invasive tool for risk stratifying patients with or suspected of having cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Complete depletion of this reserve will lead to primary infertility, and the key-limiting step of follicle depletion is the transition from primordial to primary follicles. It has been reported that this process is gonadotrophin-independent, but other conflicting reports are indicated otherwise and this discrepancy needs to be unequivocally clarified. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) in the regulation of folliculogenesis in mice passively immunised against BMP receptor 1B (BMPRIB) and BMP4. While a stereological study revealed that the numbers of primordial follicles in immunised mice were significantly higher when compared with control animals, treatment with equine chorionic gonadotrophin showed no effect. In parallel, immunofluorescence microscopy revealed the presence of BMPRIB but not FSH receptor in primordial follicles. The number of primary follicles in immunised mice were also significantly increased when compared with control animals. After puberty, the rates of depletion of primordial and primary follicles were increased with age, particularly in treated animals; however, there was no significant difference between the treatment groups of the same age. Based on these results together with our previous reports in sheep and mice, we confirm that the attenuation of BMP signalling system can be an effective approach to sustain the primordial follicle reserve while promoting the development of growing follicles, ovulation and consequently overall female fertility.', 25464680: \"Migraine is a painful condition in which patients suffer from recurrent episodes of disabling pain, which could be very severe and can lead to grave psychological disturbances. There is no curative treatment for migraine, but there are various treatment modalities, though, with conflicting reports on their efficacy. This study was conducted to compare the effectiveness of electro acupuncture therapy and the conventional drug therapy on the psychological profile of migraneurs based on the assessment of quality of life and disability parameters. Migraneurs (n = 60) were recruited from the Psychiatry and Neurology OPD, Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital, Delhi. Following a written consent, migraneurs were randomly allocated into 2 study groups--Group A received 10 sittings of electro acupuncture on selected acupuncture points over a period of 30 days, while for the same duration the Group D received a conventional drug therapy in the form of oral flunarizine 20 mg OD along with paracetamol 500 mg SOS. The patients were assessed twice, before and after completion of the treatment programme (30 days). The quality of life was assessed with WHOQOL BREF (WHO Quality of Life Biomedical Research and Education Foundation) questionnaire and the disability was assessed with MIDAS (Migraine Disability Assessment) questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed using repeated measure's ANOVA with Tukey's test. Migraneurs were found to have lower quality of life and higher disability scores but following the treatment regimes, the 2 study groups showed a significant improvement in both the parameters studied. It was however observed, that the acupuncture group showed a better response and was thus found to be more effective as compared to the drug group (P = 0.005 to 0.000). We thus conclude that acupuncture is a better treatment option than the conventional drug therapy in not only relieving the pain of migraine but in also improving the psychological profile in migraneurs. Hence its use should be encouraged as an alternative/adjunct treatment for migraine.\", 3510121: \"The concentrations of PRL, corticosterone, and insulin required by long term cultures of normal rat mammary cells to produce alpha-lactalbumin (alpha LA) and the 25,000 mol wt beta-casein were evaluated with a variety of hormone ratios and concentrations. For these studies a double antibody RIA for beta-casein capable of measuring 0.5 ng beta-casein/100 microliter growth media was developed and used along with our previously reported RIA for alpha LA. PRL was active at physiological levels (0.05-0.15 micrograms/ml) and quantitatively stimulated beta-casein more than alpha LA, whereas physiological levels of corticosterone (0.05-0.15 micrograms/ml) quantitatively stimulated alpha LA more than beta-casein. The concentration of corticosterone greatly altered the magnitude of the cells' response to insulin and PRL for alpha LA output by cells from either virginal or midpregnant rats. Insulin also enhanced production of these milk proteins, but very little effect was measured in the physiological range. alpha LA was increased more by insulin than by PRL, and beta-casein was enhanced more by insulin than by corticosterone. Cells from midpregnant rats required less insulin to stimulate beta-casein production than to stimulate alpha LA. Cells from virginal rats required a supraphysiological insulin level to stimulate both beta-casein and alpha LA under these conditions. These cells generally require 5-6 weeks to achieve a steady-state rate of milk protein output. The complexities of our observations help explain some of the conflicting reports in the literature concerning which hormone is of prime importance for quantitatively increasing the synthesis of a particular milk protein, particularly since high hormone levels are often employed and time in culture varies considerably among reports. We conclude that lower levels of all these hormones can and should be used in vitro. Our messenger RNA (mRNA) studies using cloned complementary DNA probes for two rat casein mRNAs show that cells grown for 2 months with hormones contain significant amounts of both alpha- and beta-casein mRNAs. Simultaneous quantification of beta-casein mRNA levels and rates of beta-casein protein production in these long term cell cultures indicated that a substantial portion of their beta-casein protein production is regulated by the amount of its mRNA. This could be controlled by mRNA synthesis and/or mRNA degradation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\", 19875691: 'The inflammatory response that accompanies central nervous system (CNS) injury can affect neurological outcome in both positive and negative ways. In the optic nerve, a CNS pathway that normally fails to regenerate when damaged, intraocular inflammation causes retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) to switch into an active growth state and extend lengthy axons down the nerve. The molecular basis of this phenomenon is uncertain. A prior study showed that oncomodulin (Ocm), a Ca(2+)-binding protein secreted by a macrophage cell line, is a potent axon-promoting factor for RGCs. However, it is not known whether Ocm contributes to the physiological effects of intraocular inflammation in vivo, and there are conflicting reports in the literature regarding its expression and significance. We show here that intraocular inflammation causes infiltrative cells of the innate immune system to secrete high levels of Ocm, and that agents that prevent Ocm from binding to its receptor suppress axon regeneration. These results were verified in different strains, species, and experimental models, and establish Ocm as a potent growth-promoting signal between the innate immune system and neurons in vivo.', 25446254: u'The death receptor (DR) ligand TRAIL is being evaluated in clinical trials as an anti-cancer agent; however, many studies have found that TRAIL also enhances tumor progression by activating the NF-\\u03baB pathway in apoptosis-resistant cells. Although RIP1, cFLIP and caspase-8 have been implicated in TRAIL-induced JNK and NF-\\u03baB activation, underlying mechanisms are unclear. By examining the kinetics of pathway activation in TRAIL-sensitive lymphoma cells wild-type or deficient for RIP1, TRAF2, cIAP1/2 or HOIP, we report here that TRAIL induces two phases of JNK and NF-\\u03baB activation. The early phase is activated by TRAF2- and cIAP1-mediated ubiquitination of RIP1, whereas the delayed phase is induced by caspase-dependent activation of MEKK1 independent of RIP1 and TRAF2 expression. cFLIP overexpression promotes the early phase but completely suppresses the delayed phase of pathway activation in lymphoma cells, whereas Bcl-2 overexpression promotes both the early and delayed phases of the pathways. In addition, stable overexpression of cFLIP in RIP1- or TRAF2-deficient cells confers resistance to apoptosis, but fails to mediate NF-\\u03baB activation. HOIP is not essential for, but contributes to, TRAIL-induced NF-\\u03baB activation in cFLIP-overexpressing cells. These findings not only elucidate details of the mechanisms underlying TRAIL-induced JNK and NF-\\u03baB activation, but also clarify conflicting reports in the field.', 21849968: 'Conflicting reports exist as to whether sickle cell trait is a risk factor for the progression of nephropathy. In order to determine whether African Americans with sickle cell trait are at increased risk for kidney disease, we assessed the genetic association between sickle cell trait and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Hemoglobin S, non-muscle myosin heavy chain 9 (MYH9), and apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) risk variants were genotyped in 3258 unrelated African Americans: 1085 with non-diabetic ESRD, 996 with type 2 diabetes-associated ESRD, and 1177 controls. Since APOL1 is strongly associated with ESRD in African Americans, interactions between APOL1 and MYH9 risk variants and hemoglobin S were assessed using case-only and case-control centered two-way logistic regression interaction analyses. The sickle cell trait genotype frequencies were 8.7% in non-diabetic ESRD, 7.1% in type 2 diabetes-ESRD, and 7.2% in controls. There was no age-, gender-, and admixture-adjusted significance for sickle cell trait association with non-diabetic ESRD (odds ratio 1.16); type 2 diabetes-ESRD (odds ratio 1.01); or all-cause ESRD (combined non-diabetic and type 2 diabetic-ESRD patients compared to the controls; odds ratio 1.05) in dominant models. In addition, no evidence of APOL1 or MYH9 interactions with sickle cell trait was detected. Hence, sickle cell trait is not associated with diabetic or non-diabetic ESRD in a large sample of African Americans.', 26005364: StringElement('Pancreatitis remains the most common complication of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), resulting in substantial morbidity and occasional mortality.

We generated a skp1dM mutant strain that is defective for galactose induction of the GAL1 gene and we have found that galactose-induced protein degradation of the repressor Mig2 is defective in this strain. Mig2 degradation was also abolished in cells lacking the protein kinase Snf1 and the F-box protein Das1, suggesting that Snf1 triggers galactose-induced protein degradation of Mig2 by SCFDas1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that Mig2 associates with the GAL1 promoter upon the galactose-induced exit of Mig1 in skp1dM cells, but not in wild-type cells, suggesting that the conditional degradation of Mig2 is required to prevent it from binding to the GAL1 promoter under inducing conditions. A galactose-stable deletion derivative of Mig2 caused a strong Mig (multi-copy inhibition of GAL gene expression) phenotype, confirming that galactose induction of the GAL1 gene requires the degradation of the repressor Mig2. Our results shed new light on the conflicting reports about the functional role of the degradation of transcriptional activators and indicate that gene expression studies interfering with proteasome degradation should take the stabilization of potential repressors into account.', 16123775: 'There have been conflicting reports as to whether olanzapine produces lower occupancy of striatal dopamine D(2)/D(3) receptor than typical antipsychotic drugs and preferential occupancy of extrastriatal dopamine D(2)/D(3) receptors. We performed [(18)F] fallypride PET studies in six schizophrenic subjects treated with olanzapine and six schizophrenic subjects treated with haloperidol to examine the occupancy of striatal and extrastriatal dopamine receptors by these antipsychotic drugs. [(18)F] setoperone PET studies were performed in seven olanzapine-treated subjects to determine 5-HT(2A) receptor occupancy. Occupancy of dopamine D(2)/D(3) receptors by olanzapine was not significantly different from that seen with haloperidol in the putamen, ventral striatum, medial thalamus, amygdala, or temporal cortex, that is, 67.5-78.2% occupancy; olanzapine produced no preferential occupancy of dopamine D(2)/D(3) receptors in the ventral striatum, medial thalamus, amygdala, or temporal cortex. There was, however, significantly lower occupancy of substantia nigra/VTA dopamine D(2)/D(3) receptors in olanzapine-treated compared to haloperidol-treated subjects, that is, 40.2 vs 59.3% (p=0.0014, corrected for multiple comparisons); in olanzapine-treated subjects, the substantia nigra/VTA was the only region with significantly lower dopamine D(2)/D(3) receptor occupancy than the putamen, that is, 40.2 vs 69.2% (p<0.001, corrected for multiple comparison). Occupancy of 5-HT(2A) receptors was 85-93% in the olanzapine- treated subjects. The results of this study demonstrated that olanzapine does not produce preferential occupancy of extrastriatal dopamine D(2)/D(3) receptors but does spare substantia nigra/VTA receptors. Sparing of substantia nigra/VTA dopamine D(2)/D(3) receptor occupancy may contribute to the low incidence of extrapyramidal side effects in olanzapine-treated patients.', 25747331: UnicodeElement(u'There are conflicting reports regarding seasonal sleep difficulties in polar regions.

This article presents evidence for 4 moderators of the relationship between automatic (implicit) and controlled (explicit) evaluations. Implicit and explicit preferences were measured for a variety of object pairs using a large sample. The average correlation was r=.36, and 52 of the 57 object pairs showed a significant positive correlation. Results of multilevel modeling analyses suggested that (a) implicit and explicit preferences are related, (b) the relationship varies as a function of the objects assessed, and (c) at least 4 variables moderate the relationship: self-presentation, evaluative strength, dimensionality, and distinctiveness. The variables moderated implicit-explicit correspondence across individuals and accounted for much of the observed variation across content domains. The resulting model of the relationship between automatic and controlled evaluative processes is grounded in personal experience with the targets of evaluation.', 3975045: 'This study compares, under controlled conditions and by rigorous statistical analysis, the contrast sensitivity function (CSF) measured with soft-lens and spectacle correction, attempting to resolve the conflicting reports in the literature.

Analysis of variance revealed statistically significant effects for subjects, stimuli and type of visual correction, statistically superior performance being obtained with soft lenses. However, the actual difference in the CSF for the two forms of correction was small (0.14 log units) and not clinically significant.

The hypothalamic hormones oxytocin and vasopressin were compared in radioimmunoassay of serum, urine, brain and pituitary. Information on body weight, water intake, urine output, serum hematocrit and plasma osmolality was also obtained from the same subjects and analyzed together with these data. Finally, semi quantitative histofluorescence assessment of the noradrenergic innervation of the mediobasal hypothalamus from the same animals was performed to determine the extent of central afferent input to the HNS with advancing age. The circulating levels of vasopressin and oxytocin did not significantly differ in the three age groups under basal conditions. Serum vasopressin concentration was increased following water deprivation, and the increase was comparable in all age groups. Serum oxytocin was also increased following water deprivation in all groups, but the increase was greater in the 25-month-old rats relative to the 4-month-old rats. Urinary excretion of vasopressin was used as an index of daily vasopressin secretion. The urinary concentration of vasopressin was less in aged rats relative to young controls, though an increased urine volume in the mature and old animals meant that total vasopressin excretion in the urine was comparable at all ages studied. The increased urine volume in the mature and aged rats does not appear to reflect a decrease in renal sensitivity to vasopressin, since all age groups demonstrated a comparable reduction in urine volume during water deprivation, at comparable concentrations of circulating vasopressin. These data suggest that the increase in urine volume observed in the 14- and 25-month-old rats may be a function of increased fluid intake rather than hyperactivity in the HNS. The concentrations of both peptides were reduced in the posterior pituitary of aged rats, though again, the total amount of peptide in the gland did not change. Only oxytocin showed an age-related change in the hypothalamus, decreasing in the oldest subjects. These data indicate that the ability to secrete adequate quantities of vasopressin in response to dehydration is not compromised in Fisher 344 rats up to 25 months of age.', 1978251: 'The mammalian cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase system is involved in the metabolism of drugs and chemical carcinogens. The role of these enzymes in toxicological response is exemplified by an autosomal recessive polymorphism at the cytochrome P450 CYP2D6 debrisoquine hydroxylase locus which results in the severely compromised metabolism of at least 25 drugs, and which in some cases can lead to life-threatening side-effects. In addition, this polymorphism, which affects 8-10% of the caucasian population, has been associated with altered susceptibility to lung and bladder cancer. Here we report the identification of the primary mutation responsible for this metabolic defect and the development of a simple DNA-based genetic assay to allow both the identification of most individuals at risk of drug side-effects and clarification of the conflicting reports on the association of this polymorphism with cancer susceptibility.', 3327885: \"The history of immunosuppressant drug use, both azathioprine (Aza) and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) over the past 20 years is briefly reviewed. The two drugs appear identical in their pharmacologic and biologic effects. Azathioprine is converted to 6-MP while in the body. Conflicting reports on the effectiveness of Aza have been published. The major National Cooperative Crohn's Disease Study (NCCDS) has found no advantage in Aza over placebo. In contrast, 6-MP was found to be effective in a large randomized trial. The shortcomings of the NCCDS reports are discussed with possible explanations for their negative findings. Our own studies, dating from 1968, are reviewed with 38 patients having been treated for up to 18 years, always in combination with small doses of steroids. Our results with Aza are similar to those of Present and Korelitz with 6-MP; about 70% of previously intractable patients improved substantially. Both Aza and 6-MP bring about healing and closure of most fistulas. Side effects can be serious but are usually manageable and, to some extent, preventable by appropriate dosage schedules. Since Aza has been approved for another benign, presumably autoimmune disease--rheumatoid arthritis--and because of its extensive use in other autoimmune diseases, we prefer to use Aza in selected patients with Crohn's disease who have failed to respond to more conventional modes of therapy. The use of immunosuppressants in ulcerative colitis is less clearly indicated.\", 14678781: 'Human colon cancers differ in amounts of MUC2 mucin synthesized. However, it is unclear whether MUC2 encodes a single protein. When clones of human colon cancer cells were assayed with antibodies against the TR2 mucin repeat or non-TR2 epitopes, differences in relative expression of MUC2 proteins suggested multiple immunoreactive forms. RT-PCR analysis detected the established 15kbp MUC2 cDNA and a novel form (designated MUC2.1) lacking the MUC2 TR2 repeat. Sequencing of cDNA and genomic DNA indicated that MUC2.1 results from an alternate splice donor. RT-PCR with splice-junction spanning primers confirmed the expression of MUC2.1 mRNA. Anti-MUC2.1 antibody stained colon cancer cells and normal colon in a pattern different from TR2-specific antibody. The presence of MUC2.1 mucin may help us to explain previous conflicting reports that have attempted to correlate the relative abundance of MUC2 protein and/or mRNA with the biological behavior of colon cancer cells.', 21206928: 'The combination of inadequate bone volume, poor bone quality, and elevated occlusal forces contributes to the posterior maxilla being the least predictable site for implant survival.

However, some studies use different osteotomes that may be harmful to the bone. Innovative pilot intermediary osteotomes used in conjunction with divergent sequential osteotomes to ensure parallelism, expand narrow ridges predictably, safely and significantly internally elevate the sinus, aid in future site development, and assist in immediate implant placement are introduced. The hypothesis is that the quality of bone is simultaneously enhanced, but controlled clinical studies are needed to prove this theory.', 16731800: 'Whilst the tissue distribution and range of biological actions reported for apelin suggest a role for the peptide in pressure/volume homeostasis, conflicting reports make the precise role unclear. Furthermore, few integrated studies have been performed and there are no reports of bioactivity of apelin in a large animal model. Accordingly, we have examined the haemodynamic, hormonal and renal effects of apelin in ten normal conscious sheep. Apelin (1 mg i.v. bolus) induced a biphasic haemo-dynamic response characterised by an acute fall in arterial pressure and a rise in heart rate followed immediately by a rise in arterial pressure and a fall in heart rate. The secondary hypertensive phase was associated with a fall in cardiac output (P=0.015) and significant rises in calculated total peripheral resistance (CTPR) (P<0.001) and right atrial pressure (RAP) (P=0.031). Electrocardiogram changes were also observed in four of ten sheep, most notably varying degrees of atrioventricular block. Apelin also induced significant rises in plasma arginine vasopressin (P=0.009), adrenocorticotrophin (P=0.012), aldosterone (P=0.001), cortisol (P=0.014), atrial (P=0.036) and brain (P<0.001) natriuretic peptide, cyclic GMP (P=0.003) and cyclic AMP (P=0.002) levels with no effect on renal indices. In conclusion, high dose administration of apelin to normal conscious sheep induces a significant biphasic response in arterial pressure and heart rate associated with rises in RAP and CTPR and a fall in cardiac output. Apelin also increases circulating levels of a number of vasoactive hormones. Taken together, these results suggest a potential role for apelin in pressure/volume homeostasis.', 16474002: 'A number of previous studies have suggested the involvement of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) in Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. However, there have also been a number of conflicting reports. The PI3K inhibitor wortmannin greatly enhanced TLR-mediated inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and cytokine production in the mouse macrophage cell line Raw264.7. The effect of wortmannin was common to TLR2, -3, -4, and -9 and was accompanied by activation of nuclear factor-kappaB and up-regulation of cytokine mRNA production. We were surprised to find that another PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, strongly suppressed the production of iNOS and cytokines. This effect of 2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-1(4H)-benzopyran-4-one hydrochloride (LY294002) was based on its inhibitory effect on mRNA synthesis. Expression of dominant-negative mutants of PI3K in macrophages augmented the lipopolysaccharideinduced expression of iNOS. Introduction of a pH1 vector producing short hairpin RNA that targets a catalytic subunit of PI3K (p110beta) also enhanced the TLR-mediated responses. Thus, the augmentation of TLR signals by wortmannin was mediated through the inhibition of PI3K, whereas the effect of LY294002 was not explained by its effect on PI3K. These discrepancies in the effects of pharmacological inhibitors in TLR-signaling may have caused confusion regarding the role of PI3K in innate immunity.', 10842006: 'The posteromedial lateral suprasylvian cortex represents a point of convergence between the geniculostriate and extrageniculostriate visual pathways. Given its purported role in motion analysis and the conflicting reports regarding the texture sensitivity of this area, we have investigated the response properties of cells in PMLS to moving texture patterns (\"visual noise\"). In contrast to previous reports, we have found that a large majority of cells (80.1%) responds to the motion of a texture pattern with sustained discharges. In general, responses to noise were more broadly tuned for direction compared to gratings; however, direction selectivity appeared more pronounced in response to noise. The majority of cells was selective for drift velocity of the noise pattern (mean optimal velocity: 26.7 degrees /s). Velocity tuning was comparable to that of its principal thalamic input, the lateral posterior pulvinar nucleus. In general, responsiveness of cells in the posteromedial lateral suprasylvian cortex increased with increasing texture element size, although some units were tuned to smaller element sizes than the largest presented. Finally, the magnitude of these noise responses was dependent on the area of the visual field stimulated. In general, a stimulus corresponding to roughly twice the size of the receptive field was required to elicit an equivalent half-maximal response to that for gratings. The results of this study indicate that the majority of cells in the posteromedial lateral suprasylvian cortex can be driven by the motion of a fine texture field, and highlight the importance of this area in motion analysis.', 23383963: StringElement('SPARC is a matricellular glycoprotein with growth-inhibitory and antiangiogenic activity in some cell types.

Successful intubation in a variety of difficult airway scenarios, including awake intubation, has been described, with the overall success rate in the 377 patients reported being approximately 98%. The use of the ILMA by the novice operator has also been investigated with conflicting reports as to its suitability for emergency intubation in this setting. Blind versus visualized intubation techniques have also been investigated. These techniques may provide some benefits in improved safety and success rates, although the evidence is not definitive. The use of a visualizing technique is recommended, especially whilst experience with intubation via the ILMA is being gained. The risk of oesophageal intubation is reported as 5% and one death has been described secondary to the complications of oesophageal perforation during blind intubation. Morbidity described with the use of the ILMA includes sore throat, hoarse voice and epiglottic oedema. Haemodynamic changes associated with intubation via the ILMA are of minimal clinical consequence. The ILMA is a valuable adjunct to the airway management armamentarium, especially in cases of difficult airway management.

We studied prospectively the accuracy of parallel measurements with infrared tympanic thermometer and the correlation between this method and the rectal mercury thermometer. Measurements with digital rectal thermometry are also compared with mercury thermometry. 191 adult inpatients were included. The median difference between infrared tympanic and rectal mercury thermometry in the whole material was -0.5 degree C, but increased to -1.4 degrees C in a selected group with rectal temperature 38 degrees C or more. The median difference between parallel measurements with infrared tympanic thermometer was 0.4 degree C. Digital rectal thermometry, however, was in strict accordance with the rectal mercury method. We found an unacceptable difference in body temperature between measurements with infrared tympanic thermometer and rectal mercury thermometer. In a clinical setting the infrared ear thermometer has a very low sensitivity for detecting fever. Digital rectal thermometry seems to be a good alternative to the rectal mercury thermometer.', 3377059: 'Conflicting reports on the adequacy of the visual performance provided by hydrogel contact lenses continue to appear in the literature.

During normal wear of lenses, neither the lenses themselves nor any contact lens-induced corneal changes produced measurable visual losses. The visual performance was also independent of lens fit or lens thickness over the ranges used here. The higher water content lenses provided marginally poorer visual performance.', 3582279: 'Conflicting reports exist regarding the activity of natural killer (NK) cells in resting lung. We speculated that use of cells from differing lung compartments in past studies might have contributed to these discrepancies. To address this issue, a compartmental analysis of relative NK activity of airspace (bronchoalveolar lavage) cells versus interstitial lung cells was conducted in guinea pigs. Non-pulmonary (spleen) cells were also assayed for NK activity. For assays, cells were obtained from each compartment in the same host, then assayed concomitantly using a chromium release assay with the tumor target cell line, K562. Virtually identical NK cell activity was demonstrated by cells derived from airspaces and lung interstitium. This activity was significantly less (p less than 0.05) than that of spleen cells, and its expression required periods of effector: target cell contact which were considerably longer (16 hr) than those needed for spleen cells (4 hr). Further experiments documented the capacity for augmentation of airspace NK cell activity by intratracheal instillation of interferon inducers poly I:C and carboxymethyl acridanone. We conclude that resting guinea pig pulmonary NK cells have low activity relative to systemic cells, that no significant difference in activity exists among NK cells in airspace and interstitial compartments, and that local activation of airspace NK cells is possible using intratracheal interferon inducers.', 8200109: 'We have investigated whether varied assay conditions account for the conflicting reports on measured elastolytic activity of alveolar macrophages (AM) cultured in direct contact with the 3H-elastin substrate coated onto 16-mm wells in serum-containing media. The data indicate that measured elastolytic activity in this assay system was dependent on the amount of 3H-elastin/culture well. 3H-elastin > 350 micrograms/well, in contrast to the < or = 200 micrograms/well commonly used in this assay system, resulted in optimal measurement of elastolytic activity that was linear with respect to culture time (up to 72 h examined) and was directly proportional to number of AM/well (up to 1.0 x 10(6) examined). The sensitivity of measured elastolytic activity to tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) and to Z-phe-phe (a specific cysteine proteinase inhibitor) was not affected by amount of 3H-elastin/well, but appears to be dependent on the time period of AM culture. TIMP (at 5 microM, maximal dose examined) inhibited the measured elastolytic activity by 25% in 24-h cultures compared to 69% in 72-h cultures; Z-phe-phe (at 10 microM, dose at which maximal effect was obtained) inhibited the elastolytic activity by 45% in the 24-h cultures compared to 34% in the 72-h cultures. These findings indicate that differences in substrate levels and in culture time have a significant effect on the results obtained in measurement of AM-mediated elastolytic activity in culture, which may account for the conflicting reports in the literature. Thus standard optimal assay condition are required for valid interpretation of results of AM-mediated elastolytic activity measurements.', 8853422: 'Conflicting reports claim that circulating interleukin (IL)-6 promotes or suppresses renal disease. Although autoimmune MRL-lpr mice have an increase in serum IL-6, and kidneys can produce IL-6, the relevance of systemic and local exposure remains undefined. To investigate the impact of IL-6 on kidney disease, we constructed a gene transfer approach to deliver sustained, stable IL-6 into the kidney and circulation. We infused syngeneic genetically modified tubular epithelial cells (IL-6-TEC) under the renal capsule of autoimmune and nonautoimmune mice. IL-6-TEC did not incite renal injury in any strain. Furthermore, serum IL-6 levels, which were increased three- to fivefold by IL-6-TEC, did not alter the contralateral kidney. Therefore, neither local nor systemic exposure to IL-6 promoted renal injury. As opposed to IL-6, we previously established that granulocyte macrophage (GM)-colony-stimulating factor (CSF) initiates renal injury in autoimmune mice. To determine whether IL-6 could suppress GM-CSF-incited damage, we infused GM-CSF-TEC TEC along with IL-6-TEC. Local production of IL-6 into the kidney did not alter the tempo or severity of GM-CSF-induced injury. Thus neither local nor systemic delivery of IL-6 promotes or suppresses kidney disease.', 17379248: u'High-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is an effective treatment for inflammatory demyelinating neuropathies, although the mechanism(s) of action remain incompletely understood. Experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN) is an animal model of inflammatory demyelinating neuropathies; however, there have been conflicting reports regarding the efficacy of human IVIg in EAN. To obtain a model suitable for the study of the mechanism(s) of action of IVIg in Guillain-Barr\\xe9 syndrome, we investigated the effect of IVIg in EAN in the rat using clinical, electrophysiological and morphological measures. Human IVIg administered at the onset of signs of disease proved effective in preventing further progression of disease and shortening disease duration. This effectiveness was associated with significant differences in electrophysiological parameters including less prolongation of somatosensory evoked potential (S wave) latencies, better maintained S wave amplitudes, less reduction of distal motor nerve conduction velocity, and better maintained amplitudes of compound muscle action potentials of the dorsal foot muscles after stimulation at ankle and hip. Moreover, treatment with IVIg resulted in significantly lower histological grades in rat EAN. The current study provides evidence that human IVIg is effective in the treatment of EAN in the rat, indicating that this model may facilitate further investigation of the mechanism(s) of action of IVIg in inflammatory demyelinating neuropathies.', 16740273: 'Sensitive and efficient methods for detecting anti-erythropoietin (anti-EPO) antibodies are needed for analysis and, above all, for large scale screening of human serum samples. ELISA is an attractive alternative to labor-intensive radioimmunoprecipitation assays but apparently conflicting reports question its sensitivity. We sought to resolve this issue by directly comparing different reported ELISA approaches to determine whether rhEPO-coating methods affect detection of anti-EPO antibodies. Investigators reporting low sensitivity had used ELISAs in which rhEPO was directly coated to microtiter plates while the high sensitivity ELISA used plate-bound streptavidin to bind biotinylated rhEPO. Using anti-EPO positive human sera, our results confirmed a large (100- to 300-fold) difference in sensitivity between the ELISAs and suggested that the inferiority of the low sensitivity ELISA was caused by the direct coating of rhEPO which may disrupt epitopes by masking recognition sites or introducing conformational changes. Thus, a bridging ELISA can be an appropriate and effective system for antibody analysis and screening of human sera with high sensitivity and specificity but only if performed with streptavidin binding of biotinylated antigen. This finding may also be more generally applicable to the detection of antibodies against other protein antigens.', 7903154: \"Conflicting reports of MDR1 gene expression in human tumours are observed according to whether studies are performed at the mRNA or P-glycoprotein level. We have investigated this expression in 22 clinically drug-resistant sarcomas at the mRNA level by Northern blot (NB), Dot blot (DB), in situ hybridisation (ISH), and at the protein level by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using three monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs): C219, JSB1, MRK16. Increased MDR1 mRNA expression was detected by NB, DB, and ISH in 1/22 sarcoma (an Ewing's sarcoma). ISH was perfectly correlated with DB hybridisation and confirmed the expression of tumoral cells alone. Specific staining of 100% of tumoral cells was obtained with the three MoAbs in the same sarcoma. Expression in tumoral cells of 12 other sarcomas was detected with MRK16, and positive staining of stromal cells with both C219 (1/22) and MRK16 (8/22) was observed. This study confirms that MDR1 overexpression occurs in human sarcomas but is not the principal mechanism of drug-resistance. Furthermore, positivity with one antibody does not necessarily imply the presence of P glycoprotein (P-gp) and a disparity may exist between the levels of P-gp and its mRNA in the same sample. So care must be taken in interpreting results and more sensitive techniques such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) could prove useful.\", 3948473: 'Prior studies of the association between oral contraceptives (OCs) and gallbladder disease (GBD) have yielded conflicting results.

The crude relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for symptomatic GBD resulting in medical care was 1.14 (CI 1.09 to 1.20), with a clear dose-response (P less than 0.001). Age markedly modified the effect of OCs on GBD. The RR (CI) decreased from 3.1 (2.7 to 3.6) in women 15 to 19 years old to 1.2 (0.9 to 1.5) in women 40 to 44 years old, providing an explanation for previously conflicting reports. The effects of a number of other risk factors on GBD, some which have been controversial, were also confirmed. Adjustment for these did not change the results. In conclusion, OCs are risk factors for GBD, although the risk is of sufficient magnitude to be of potential clinical importance only in young women.', 25145274: 'Human embryonic stem (ES) cells are routinely cultured under atmospheric oxygen (~20%), a concentration that is known to impair embryo development in vitro and is likely to be suboptimal for maintaining human ES cells compared with physiological (~5%) oxygen conditions. Conflicting reports exist on the effect of oxygen during human ES cell culture and studies have been largely limited to characterisation of typical stem cell markers or analysis of global expression changes. This study aimed to identify physiological markers that could be used to evaluate the metabolic impact of oxygen on the MEL-2 human ES cell line after adaptation to either 5% or 20% oxygen in extended culture. ES cells cultured under atmospheric oxygen displayed decreased glucose consumption and lactate production when compared with those cultured under 5% oxygen, indicating an overall higher flux of glucose through glycolysis under physiological conditions. Higher glucose utilisation at 5% oxygen was accompanied by significantly increased expression of all glycolytic genes analysed. Analysis of amino acid turnover highlighted differences in the consumption of glutamine and threonine and in the production of proline. The expression of pluripotency and differentiation markers was, however, unaltered by oxygen and no observable difference in proliferation between cells cultured in 5% and 20% oxygen was seen. Apoptosis was elevated under 5% oxygen conditions.

The incidence of vertebral artery injuries (VAI) is more common than previously thought and regular screening is seldom performed. However there exists no screening criteria and conflicting reports exists between spine and trauma literature. Many clinicians do not routinely screen/evaluate patients presenting with cervical spine trauma for potential VAI. This article provides a brief summary of existing evidence regarding the incidence of VAI in the background of cervical trauma/fractures.

In a standard wort, maltotriose is the second most abundant sugar, and slower uptake leads to residual maltotriose in the finished product. The limiting factor of sugar metabolism is its transport, and there are conflicting reports on whether a specific maltotriose permease exists or whether the mechanisms responsible for maltose uptake also carry out maltotriose transport. In this study, radiolabeled maltotriose was used to show that overexpression of the maltose permease gene, MAL61, in an industrial yeast strain resulted in an increase in the rate of transport of maltotriose as well as maltose. A strain derived from W303-1A and lacking any maltose or maltotriose transporter but carrying a functional maltose transport activator (MAL63) was developed. By complementing this strain with permeases encoded by MAL31, MAL61, and AGT1, it was possible to measure their specific transport kinetics by using maltotriose and maltose. All three permeases were capable of high-affinity transport of maltotriose and of allowing growth of the strain on the sugar. Maltotriose utilization from the permease encoded by AGT1 was regulated by the same genetic mechanisms as those involving the maltose transcriptional activator. Competition studies carried out with two industrial strains, one not containing any homologue of AGT1, showed that maltose uptake and maltotriose uptake were competitive and that maltose was the preferred substrate. These results indicate that the presence of residual maltotriose in beer is not due to a genetic or physiological inability of yeast cells to utilize the sugar but rather to the lower affinity for maltotriose uptake in conjunction with deteriorating conditions present at the later stages of fermentation. Here we identify molecular mechanisms regulating the uptake of maltotriose and determine the role of each of the transporter genes in the cells.', 21143499: StringElement('Different conflicting reports have been published for the use of atracurium in morbidly obese patients.

In New Zealand, vineyards utilise CCA-treated posts at a rate of 579 posts per hectare. This represents a potential CCA burden on the soil of 12, 21, and 17 kg/ha, respectively, for the three elements. Given a replacement rate of 4% per year, the use of CCA-treated posts may result in an accumulation of these elements in the soil, possibly leading to groundwater contamination. We undertook a general survey to determine the extent of CCA leaching from treated vineyard posts. Treated Pinus radiata posts were sampled at six sites around the Marlborough region of New Zealand to represent a range of post ages and soil types. For each post, above- and belowground wood samples were taken. As well, the soil adjacent to the post was sampled at a 50 mm horizontal and 100 mm vertical distances from the post. The belowground wood samples of the posts had significantly lower CCA concentrations than the aboveground portions, which were not significantly different from new posts. This indicates leaching. Soils surrounding the posts had significantly higher CCA concentrations than control soils. Higher CCA concentrations were measured under the posts than laterally. Some 25% of the samples exceeded 100 mg/kg As, the Australian National Environment Protection Council (ANEPC) guideline level for As in agricultural soil, and 10% exceeded 100 mg/kg Cr, the ANEPC limit for chromium. At one site, we found a significant positive correlation between post age and CCA-leaching. The CCA issue could be eliminated by using alternative posts, such as steel, concrete, or untreated woods such as Eucalyptus or beech. Alternatively, CCA-treated posts could, for example, be lacquered or otherwise protected, to reduce the rate of CCA leaching.', 29319119: u'A cluster of three Specificity Protein (Sp) genes (Sp1-4, Sp5 and Sp6-9) is thought to be ancestral in both chordates and the wider Eumetazoa. Sp5 and Sp6-9 gene groups are associated with embryonic growth zones, such as tailbuds, and are both Wnt/\\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway members and targets. Currently, there are conflicting reports as to the number and identity of Sp genes in the cephalochordates, the sister group to the vertebrates and urochordates. We confirm the SP complement of Branchiostoma belcheri and Branchiostoma lanceolatum, as well as their genomic arrangement, protein domain structure and residue frequency. We assay Sp5 expression in B. lanceolatum embryos, and determine its response to pharmacologically increased \\u03b2-catenin signalling. Branchiostoma possesses three Sp genes, located on the same genomic scaffold. Phylogenetic and domain structure analyses are consistent with their identification as SP1-4, SP5 and SP6-9, although SP1-4 contains a novel glutamine-rich N-terminal region. SP5 is expressed in axial mesoderm and neurectoderm, and marks the cerebral vesicle and presumptive pharynx. Early exposure to increased \\u03b2-catenin caused ubiquitous SP5 expression in late gastrula, while later treatment at gastrula stages reduced SP5 expression in the posterior growth zone during axis elongation. Amphioxus possess a typical invertebrate eumetazoan SP complement, and SP5 expression in embryos is well conserved with vertebrate homologues. Its expression in the tailbud, a posterior growth zone, is consistent with expression seen in other bilaterians. Branchiostoma SP5 shows a dynamic response to Wnt/\\u03b2-catenin signalling.', 22949840: 'CA125 is the most widely used tumour marker in ovarian cancer with unsatisfactory sensitivity and specificity especially at early stage. It is quantified by antibody-based immunoassays; however different molecular weight isoforms have been described in the literature which have never been validated by mass spectrometry, potentially affecting the diagnostic accuracy and clinical reliability of the test. In this study, CA125 was detected by Western blot and its identity confirmed by mass spectrometry. Two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis in combination with mass spectrometry revealed that positive Western blot signals up to 500 kDa are most likely false-positive interactions of M11-like and OC125-like antibodies. Fibronectin, identified as one of these false-positive interaction partners, increased the reading for CA125 in a first generation ELISA significantly (p = 0.02). The existence of low-molecular weight isoforms of CA125 is therefore questionable and is most likely reflecting cross-reactivity of the antibodies with other proteins. This would explain the conflicting reports on the molecular structure of CA125 and also the inconsistency of CA125 levels by different ELISAs. Our results are also the first steps towards a mass spectrometric assay for CA125 quantification, which would improve sensitivity and reliability.', 7471057: 'Because there are conflicting reports regarding the effects of Corynebacterium parvum (CP) on natural killer (NK) cell activity, several different strains of CP were compared. In replicate experiments, age- and sex-matched mice received 0.25-mg i.p. injections of one of four types of CP; formalin-killed strain 6134; heat-killed strain 6134; formalin-killed strain 5888 (actually Corynebacterium granulosum); or formalin-killed CP from the Pasteur Institute. At various days thereafter, two to three mice from each group were sacrificed to determine spleen weight, cellularity, and NK cell activity versus YAC-1 lymphoma cells. The CP from the Pasteur Institute augmented NK cell activity 3 days following injections; however, the activity returned to normal by Day 7 and remained at that level. On the other hand, strain 5888 did not cause as great an increase in lytic activity as did the Pasteur Institute CP at Day 3; but by Day 10 after injection, NK cell levels were above control, and they remained elevated through Day 21. Both the heat-killed and formalin-killed preparations of strain 6134 stimulated NK cell activity initially but resulted in a loss of activity at the later times tested. Experiments done with different doses and routes of injection yielded similar results. Thus, we were able to demonstrate that different types of CP have different effects on NK cell activity in mice and that the general kinetics of these effects were independent of dose or route of administration.', 2457556: 'Several conflicting reports on the ability of IgG4 to mediate type I allergic reactions have appeared lately. We have developed a model system for testing this possibility, using passive sensitization of basophil leucocytes from normal individuals. At first, the system was optimized with regard to donor cells and anti-IgG4 antibody: among 3 normal individuals with cells showing high, medium and low responses to anti-IgE, only the high responder showed a reproducible, but low response to anti-IgG4. This response was consistent when testing anti-IgG4 from different sources, and could be potentiated by a phorbol ester TPA, although not up to the level of anti-IgE. The cells from the high responding donor and a monoclonal anti-IgG4 were selected for further studies. Serum pools from patients allergic to house dust mite (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus) were used for passive sensitization. The pools contained allergen-specific IgE with or without concomitant IgG4 of the same specificity. The sensitized basophils reacted to anti-IgE and allergen, but to anti-IgG4 only to a small extent. However, when these serum pools were fractionated by affinity chromatography, only the IgE fractions and not the IgG4 fractions made the cells reactive towards specific allergen. It was still possible to elicit a reaction by triggering IgE with anti-IgE, whereas only a small reaction was seen, when IgG4-sensitized basophils were provoked with anti-IgG4. We conclude that IgG4 does not sensitize normal basophils.', 28508119: StringElement('Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the USA and around the world. While we are now able to achieve significant low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering with current therapies, many patients remain at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Moreover, there is now strong evidence supporting the causal relationship between Lp(a) and aortic stenosis as well as peripheral arterial disease. Despite the growing interest in this lipoprotein, the current therapeutic options for Lp(a) reduction are limited. Our general approach in patients with elevated Lp(a) levels is to aggressively manage other modifiable cardiovascular risk factors including lifestyle modification, consideration of aspirin therapy, and LDL-C lowering. Unfortunately, there are conflicting reports on how effective this strategy is at reducing the risk for cardiovascular events attributed to elevated Lp(a). As a result, targeted Lp(a)-lowering strategies are needed.

Conflicting reports attribute HPV-16 entry to clathrin-dependent and -independent mechanisms. To comprehensively describe the cell biological features of HPV-16 entry into human epithelial cells, we compared HPV-16 pseudovirion (PsV) infection in the context of cell perturbations (drug inhibition, siRNA silencing, overexpression of dominant mutants) to five other viruses (influenza A virus, Semliki Forest virus, simian virus 40, vesicular stomatitis virus, and vaccinia virus) with defined endocytic requirements. Our analysis included infection data, i.e. GFP expression after plasmid delivery by HPV-16 PsV, and endocytosis assays in combination with electron, immunofluorescence, and video microscopy. The results indicated that HPV-16 entry into HeLa and HaCaT cells was clathrin-, caveolin-, cholesterol- and dynamin-independent. The virus made use of a potentially novel ligand-induced endocytic pathway related to macropinocytosis. This pathway was distinct from classical macropinocytosis in regards to vesicle size, cholesterol-sensitivity, and GTPase requirements, but similar in respect to the need for tyrosine kinase signaling, actin dynamics, Na\\u207a/H\\u207a exchangers, PAK-1 and PKC.

Agents that stimulate the innate immune response could provide advantages for cell-based therapies. However, there are conflicting reports concerning whether toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling controls tumor growth. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of intralesional administration of a TLR7 agonist in melanoma therapy. B16cOVA melanoma was implanted to TLR7 mice to evaluate the roles of stromal TLR7 on melanoma growth. To capitalize on the potential deleterious effects of TLR7 stimulation on the tumor growth, we injected melanoma tumor nodules with a newly developed and potent TLR7 agonist. B16 melanoma nodules expanded more rapidly in TLR7-deficient and MyD88 mice compared with TLR9 and wild type mice. Repeated injections with low doses of unconjugated TLR7 agonist were more effective at attenuating nodule size than a single high dose injection. To improve the efficacy we conjugated the agonist to phospholipid or phospholipids-polyethylene glycol, which retained TLR7 specificity. The phospholipid conjugate was indeed more effective in reducing lesion size. Furthermore, intralesional administration of the phospholipid TLR7 agonist conjugate enhanced the antimelanoma effects of systemic treatment with interleukin (IL)-2 and prolonged the survival of mice compared with IL-2 alone. Our study showed that: (1) TLR7/MyD88 signaling in the stroma is involved in melanoma growth; and (2) intralesional administration of a TLR7 agonist reduces the growth of melanoma nodules and enhances the antimelanoma effects of IL-2.', 21347323: UnicodeElement(u\"Impaired insulin signalling is increasingly thought to contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Recent evidence suggests that some of these inconsistencies may relate to the practice of regarding these disorders as a unitary syndrome. There is also evidence that both the topographic distribution of these involuntary movements and the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying them may differ in the young and in the old. In this study, demographic, clinical, treatment and neuropsychological variables were investigated for association with the presence of orofacial and limb-truncal dyskinesias in 57 schizophrenic patients aged less than 60 years. Stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis showed that orofacial dyskinesia, at different degrees of severity, was negatively associated with positive schizophrenic syndrome and with either age at assessment or age at onset of illness. None of the indices of schizophrenic deficit (cognitive impairment, clinical defect state, behavioural deterioration, or neurological dysfunction) was related to orofacial dyskinesia. Limb-truncal involuntary movements were negatively related to current daily dosage of neuroleptics. The findings indicate that these two types of dyskinesia may involve different underlying mechanisms and that, for young schizophrenic patients, current pathophysiological or neurochemical theories of involuntary movement disorders are inadequate in explaining their origins.', 17209321: 'The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended the use of absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) as a potential marker for immunosuppression where CD4+ count is unavailable.

To evaluate the usefulness of ALC as an alternative to CD4+ counts and to see whether TB affects the correlation of ALC with CD4+ counts in patients with HIV-associated TB. A total of 66 consecutive patients (33 with and 33 without TB) with a diagnosis of HIV infection were recruited into the study as cases. Another group of 66 subjects (33 subjects each) age- and sex-matched HIV-negative controls were recruited as controls and stratified in to two: a) HIV-negative PTB patients. b) apparently healthy HIV and PTB negative individuals. The age range was from 15-60 years (median: 32 years). The highest percentage (39%) of subjects fell in the age range of 25-29 years. The mean ALC for HIV-associated PTB was 3906 +/- 1092 cells/microl and for patients with HIV infection only. 4755 +/- 1049 cells/microl. There was no significant difference in mean ALC between males and females in both groups (P > 0.05). Patients with dual infection by M. tuberculosis and HIV had the lowest mean ALC (3906 +/- 1092 cells/microl). Healthy controls had mean ALC (+/- SD) of 5249 +/- 101 cells/microl. There was significant difference between the healthy controls and the other three groups. The observed difference was more in patients with HIV/ TB co-infection (P < 0.005) compared with patients with HIV alone (P < 0.05). No significant correlation was observed between CD4+ cell counts and ALC in all the age groups of the study population. When the CD4+ counts were divided into < 200 and > or = 200 cells/microl and the ALC into < 2000 and > or = 2000 cells/microl, the sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive values of the diagnostic usefulness of ALC in HIV-associated PTB were 52%. 56.3% and 78.8% while for HIV only patients the same values were 56.3%. 55.9% and 54.5%, respectively. We cannot recommend the use of ALC as a surrogate for CD4+ count in our environment as this study has clearly shown that the correlation between the two is weak.

Conflicting reports in the literature on the effects of inositol starvation upon viability of S. pombe had cast doubt on the suitability of using inositol-less death in a mutant enrichment procedure for this organism. We determined that inositol-less death was strain dependent, with differences in viability of up to 5 orders of magnitude observed between the most-sensitive strain, 972, and the least-sensitive strain, SP837. Inositol-less death was also dependent upon the cell concentration at the time of initiation of starvation. While inositol-less death occurred at all four temperatures tested, the kinetics of death was slower at 16 degrees C than at 23, 30, or 37 degrees C. Inositol-less death was observed during growth in fermentable and nonfermentable carbon sources, although loss of viability in glycerol-ethanol was significantly slower than that in glucose, sucrose, or raffinose. The feasibility of exploiting inositol-less death to enrich for spontaneous mutants was demonstrated by the identification of amino acid auxotrophs, nucleotide auxotrophs, carbon source utilization mutants, and temperature-sensitive mutants.

One hundred and seven patients with OSSC who received a mandibulectomy were included. Before treatment all patients underwent a contrast-enhanced multi-detector CT. Axial 3 or 1.25 mm thick images were reconstructed for evaluation in overlapping technique and displayed in a bone (1400/400 HU) and a soft tissue window (350/50 HU). CT scans were examined by three investigators and compared with the histological findings. The radiological examination showed a high interrater reliability (Cronbachs alpha 0.982). Comparing the radiological findings with the histological results the CT showed 8 false-positive results and 8 false-negative patients. The quality criteria for detecting bone involvement of OSSC by CT were calculated as follows: sensitivity 82.6%; specificity 86.9%; positive predictive value 82.6%; negative predictive value 86.9%. However, in all false-positive patients a sagittal bone defect of 15.1mm could be found presumably caused by pressure of the tumor, but no histologically detectable bone infiltration.

(345)2-HxCB exposure prior to antigen challenge (day -14, -7, or -1 relative to P815 injection on day 0) produced significant suppression of the CTL response. (345)2-HxCB exposure 6 weeks prior to antigen challenge was still significantly suppressive, although the reduced degree of suppression suggested that recovery was in progress. When (345)2-HxCB exposure occurred after antigen challenge, significant suppression was produced only when exposure occurred within the first three days of the response, suggesting that, as the CTL matured, their sensitivity to (345)2-HxCB diminished. Clearance of the allogeneic tumor cells from the peritoneal cavity was delayed in (345)2-HxCB-treated mice and was associated with an altered composition of the white blood cell infiltrate in the peritoneal cavity. Symptoms of overt toxicity as well as immunotoxicity were apparent at lower doses of (345)2-HxCB in male as compared to female mice. In addition, interactive effects of (345)2-HxCB exposure and P815 antigen challenge on body weight and thymic involution were observed in both male and female mice. Possible mechanisms for the altered CTL response in (345)2-HxCB-exposed mice are discussed.\"}\n"
